These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEarnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization\nManagement uses earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA adjusted for non-core or certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management’s determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. \nNet income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders\n is reconciled to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as follows:\n110\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders\n$\n3,348 \n$\n(2,494)\n$\n(429)\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n33 \n27 \n60 \nNet (income) loss from discontinued operations\n (1)\n(68)\n(27)\n(30)\nEquity loss (income) of affiliates\n(133)\n(63)\n(107)\nIncome and mining tax expense (benefit)\n1,397 \n526 \n455 \nDepreciation and amortization\n2,576 \n2,108 \n2,185 \nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest\n375 \n243 \n227 \nEBITDA\n$\n7,528 \n$\n320 \n$\n2,361 \nAdjustments:\nLoss on assets held for sale\n (2)\n$\n1,114 \n$\n— \n$\n— \nImpairment charges\n (3)\n78 \n1,891 \n1,320 \nNewcrest transaction and integration costs\n (4)\n72 \n464 \n— \nReclamation and remediation charges\n (5)\n(71)\n1,260 \n713 \nChange in fair value of investments and options\n (6)\n(62)\n47 \n46 \nSettlement costs\n (7)\n44 \n7 \n22 \nRestructuring and severance\n (8)\n38 \n24 \n4 \n(Gain) loss on asset and investment sales\n (9)\n(35)\n197 \n(35)\nGain on debt extinguishment\n (10)\n(32)\n— \n— \nPension settlements \n(11)\n1 \n9 \n137 \nCOVID-19 specific costs\n (12)\n— \n1 \n3 \nOther\n (13)\n— \n(5)\n(21)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n8,675 \n$\n4,215 \n$\n4,550 \n____________________________\n(1)\nFor additional information regarding our discontinued operations, refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(2)\nLoss on assets held for sale, included in \nLoss on assets held for sale\n, represents the loss recorded to recognize the six non-core assets and the development project designated as held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value in 2024.

Amounts related to 2022 are primarily comprised of a reimbursement of certain historical Goldcorp operational expenses related to a legacy project that reached commercial production in the second quarter of 2022 and penalty income from an energy vendor early terminating a contract in 2022.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\nManagement uses Adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income (loss) allows investors and analysts to understand the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the sale of products, by excluding certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Adjustments to continuing operations are presented before tax and net of our partners’ noncontrolling interests, when applicable. The tax effect of adjustments is presented in the Tax effect of adjustments line and is calculated using the applicable tax rate.

Refer to Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n(12)\nOther, included \nOther income (loss), net\n, primarily represents a $11 reimbursement of certain historical Goldcorp operational expenses related to a legacy project that reached commercial production in the second quarter of 2022 and $7 of penalty income from an energy vendor early terminating a contract in 2022.\n(13)\nThe tax effect of adjustments, included in \nIncome and mining tax benefit (expense)\n, represents the tax effect of adjustments in footnotes (4) through (12), as described above, and are calculated using the applicable tax rate.\n(14)\nValuation allowance and other tax adjustments, included in \nIncome and mining tax benefit (expense)\n, is recorded for items such as foreign tax credits, alternative minimum tax credits, capital losses, disallowed foreign losses, and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The adjustment reflects the net increase or (decrease) to net operating losses, capital losses, tax credit carryovers, and other deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance of $246, the expiration of U.S. foreign tax credit carryovers of $31, the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities of $(86), net removal to the reserve for uncertain tax positions of $(8), a tax settlement in Mexico of $(125) and other tax adjustments of $24. Total amount is presented net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $82.\nFree Cash Flow\nManagement uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free Cash Flow is \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n less \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations\n less \nAdditions to property, plant and mine development\n as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company’s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company’s calculation of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP Free Cash Flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company’s performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. The Company’s definition of Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view Free Cash Flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n, which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow, as well as information regarding \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n and \nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n6,363 \n$\n2,763 \n$\n3,220 \nLess: Net cash used in (provided by) operating activities of discontinued operations\n(45)\n(9)\n(22)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations\n6,318 \n2,754 \n3,198 \nLess: Additions to property, plant and mine development\n(3,402)\n(2,666)\n(2,131)\nFree Cash Flow\n$\n2,916 \n$\n88 \n$\n1,067 \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n (1)\n$\n(2,702)\n$\n(1,002)\n$\n(2,983)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n(2,953)\n$\n(1,603)\n$\n(2,356)\n____________________________\n(1)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities \nincludes\n Additions to property, plant and mine development,\n which is included in the Company’s computation of Free Cash Flow.\nNet Debt\nManagement uses Net Debt to measure the Company’s liquidity and financial position. Net Debt is calculated as \nDebt\n and \nLease and other financing obligations\n less \nCash and cash equivalents\n, as presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nCash and cash equivalents\n are subtracted from \nDebt\n and \nLease and other financing obligations \nas these could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations. The Company believes the use of Net Debt allows investors and others to evaluate financial flexibility and strength of the Company's balance sheet. Net Debt is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate this measure differently. \nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net Debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to \nDebt\n and \nLease and other financing obligations\n, which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to Net Debt.\n115\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2024\nAt December 31, 2023\nDebt\n$\n8,476 \n$\n8,874 \nLease and other financing obligations\n496 \n562 \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents\n(3,619)\n(3,002)\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents included in assets held for sale\n (1)\n(45)\n— \nNet debt\n$\n5,308 \n$\n6,434 \n____________________________\n(1)\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, certain non-core assets were determined to meet the criteria for assets held for sale. As a result, the related \nCash and cash equivalents \nwas reclassified to \nAssets held for sale\n. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCosts Applicable to Sales per Ounce/Gold Equivalent Ounce\nCosts applicable to sales\n per ounce/gold equivalent ounce are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and other metals by gold ounces or gold equivalent ounces sold, respectively. These measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. We believe that these measures provide additional information to management, investors and others that aids in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility into the direct and indirect costs related to production, excluding depreciation and amortization, on a per ounce/gold equivalent ounce basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.\nThe following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nGold\n (1)\nGEO\n (2)\nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCosts applicable to sales\n (3)\n$\n7,364 \n$\n5,689 \n$\n5,423 \n$\n1,599 \n$\n1,010 \n$\n1,045 \nGold/GEO sold (thousand ounces)\n (4)\n6,539 \n5,420 \n5,812 \n1,916 \n896 \n1,275 \nCosts applicable to sales per ounce\n (5)\n$\n1,126 \n$\n1,050 \n$\n933 \n$\n834 \n$\n1,127 \n$\n819 \n____________________________\n(1)\nIncludes by-product credits of $179, $124, and $109 in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes by-product credits of $61, $13, and $8 in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(3)\nExcludes\n Depreciation and amortization\n and \nReclamation and remediation\n.\n(4)\nGold equivalent ounces is calculated as pounds or ounces produced multiplied by the ratio of the other metals price to the gold price, using Gold ($1,400/oz.), Copper ($3.50/lb.), Silver ($20.00/oz.), Lead ($1.00/lb.) and Zinc ($1.20/lb.) pricing for 2024 and 2023, and Gold ($1,200/oz.), Copper ($3.25/lb.), Silver ($23.00/oz.), Lead ($0.95/lb.) and Zinc ($1.15/lb.) pricing for 2022.\n(5)\nPer ounce measures may not recalculate due to rounding.\nAll-In Sustaining Costs\nCurrent GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, Newmont calculates All-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) based on the definition published by the World Gold Council. The World Gold Council is a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by gold mining companies around the world and is a regulatory organization. \nAISC is a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations. We believe that AISC is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and others that aids in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.\nAISC amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in IFRS, or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development (i.e. non-sustaining) activities based upon each company’s internal policies.\n116\nTable of Contents\nThe following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the AISC measure:\nCosts applicable to sales\n. Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from CAS, such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes \nDepreciation and amortization\n and \nReclamation and remediation\n, which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of other metals. The other metals' CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and other metals is based upon the relative sales value of gold and other metals produced during the period.\nReclamation costs\n. Includes accretion expense related to reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related ARC for the Company’s operating properties. Accretion related to the reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals.\nAdvanced projects, research and development and exploration\n. Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations. As these costs relate to sustaining our production, and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the \nAdvanced projects, research and development\n and \nExploration\n amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations less incurred expenses related to the development of new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. We also allocate these costs incurred at Corporate and Other using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals. \nGeneral and administrative\n. Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to supporting our corporate structure and fulfilling our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis. We allocate these costs to gold and other metals at Corporate and Other using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals.\nOther expense, net\n. Excludes certain exceptional or unusual expenses, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to \nOther expense, net\n is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to \nNet income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders\n as disclosed in the Company’s non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals.\nTreatment and refining costs\n. Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of \nSales\n on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals.\nSustaining capital and finance lease payments\n. We determined sustaining capital and finance lease payments as those capital expenditures and finance lease payments that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. We determined development (i.e. non-sustaining) capital expenditures and finance lease payments to be those payments used to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations where those projects will materially benefit the operation and are excluded from the calculation of AISC. The classification of sustaining and development capital projects and finance leases is based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital and finance lease payments are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company’s current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. We also allocate these costs incurred at Corporate and Other using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals.\n117\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nCosts Applicable to Sales\n (1)(2)(3)\nReclamation Costs\n (4)\nAdvanced Projects, Research and Development and Exploration\n (5)\nGeneral and Administrative\nOther Expense, Net\n (6)\nTreatment and Refining Costs\nSustaining Capital and Lease Related Costs\n (7)(8)\nAll-In Sustaining Costs\nOunces (000) Sold\nAll-In Sustaining Costs per Ounce\n (9)\nGold\nBrucejack\n$\n312 \n$\n5 \n$\n13 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n3 \n$\n66 \n$\n399 \n249 \n$\n1,603 \nRed Chris\n47 \n2 \n1 \n— \n— \n— \n12 \n62 \n39 \n$\n1,607 \nPeñasquito\n225 \n8 \n— \n— \n— \n16 \n36 \n285 \n290 \n$\n984 \nMerian \n401 \n8 \n15 \n— \n— \n1 \n83 \n508 \n274 \n$\n1,852 \nCerro Negro\n312 \n6 \n2 \n1 \n2 \n— \n61 \n384 \n236 \n$\n1,631 \nYanacocha\n353 \n34 \n9 \n— \n3 \n— \n22 \n421 \n352 \n$\n1,196 \nBoddington\n613 \n16 \n1 \n— \n— \n13 \n105 \n748 \n581 \n$\n1,288 \nTanami\n390 \n3 \n7 \n— \n— \n— \n127 \n527 \n411 \n$\n1,281 \nCadia\n297 \n2 \n9 \n— \n— \n16 \n152 \n476 \n454 \n$\n1,048 \nLihir\n787 \n12 \n16 \n— \n2 \n— \n121 \n938 \n620 \n$\n1,512 \nAhafo\n722 \n19 \n5 \n— \n1 \n1 \n108 \n856 \n798 \n$\n1,072 \nNGM\n1,263 \n18 \n13 \n9 \n4 \n6 \n350 \n1,663 \n1,036 \n$\n1,605 \nCorporate and Other \n(10)\n— \n— \n111 \n386 \n19 \n— \n18 \n534 \n— \n$\n— \nHeld for Sale \n(11)\nCC&V\n200 \n11 \n3 \n— \n2 \n— \n27 \n243 \n144 \n$\n1,691 \nMusselwhite\n224 \n4 \n6 \n— \n1 \n— \n96 \n331 \n215 \n$\n1,541 \nPorcupine\n310 \n12 \n5 \n— \n— \n— \n79 \n406 \n282 \n$\n1,437 \nÉléonore\n325 \n5 \n11 \n— \n— \n— \n99 \n440 \n243 \n$\n1,811 \nAkyem\n338 \n21 \n1 \n— \n1 \n— \n23 \n384 \n212 \n$\n1,816 \nDivested \n(12)\nTelfer\n245 \n11 \n10 \n— \n— \n4 \n38 \n308 \n103 \n$\n2,993 \nTotal Gold\n7,364 \n197 \n238 \n396 \n35 \n60 \n1,623 \n9,913 \n6,539 \n$\n1,516 \nGold equivalent ounces - other metals\n (13)(14)\nRed Chris\n172 \n5 \n4 \n— \n— \n5 \n47 \n233 \n142 \n$\n1,640 \nPeñasquito\n903 \n32 \n1 \n2 \n2 \n117 \n129 \n1,186 \n1,088 \n$\n1,090 \nBoddington\n204 \n3 \n— \n— \n— \n11 \n22 \n240 \n205 \n$\n1,172 \nCadia\n280 \n2 \n10 \n— \n— \n32 \n136 \n460 \n465 \n$\n987 \nCorporate and Other \n(10)\n— \n— \n14 \n44 \n— \n— \n1 \n59 \n— \n$\n— \nDivested \n(12)\nTelfer\n40 \n2 \n1 \n— \n— \n2 \n4 \n49 \n16 \n$\n2,885 \nTotal Gold Equivalent Ounces\n1,599 \n44 \n30 \n46 \n2 \n167 \n339 \n2,227 \n1,916 \n$\n1,161 \nConsolidated\n$\n8,963 \n$\n241 \n$\n268 \n$\n442 \n$\n37 \n$\n227 \n$\n1,962 \n$\n12,140 \n____________________________\n(1)\nExcludes \nDepreciation and amortization\n and \nReclamation and remediation\n.\n(2)\nIncludes by-product credits of $240.\n(3)\nIncludes stockpile, leach pad, and product inventory adjustments of $2 at Brucejack, $27 at Red Chris, $1 at Peñasquito, $9 at Cerro Negro, $21 at NGM, and $32 at Telfer.\n(4)\nIncludes operating accretion of $153, included in \nReclamation and remediation\n, and amortization of asset retirement costs $88; excludes accretion and reclamation and remediation adjustments at former operating properties that have entered the closure phase and have no substantive future economic value of $219 and $(44), respectively, included in \nReclamation and remediation\n.\n(5)\nExcludes development expenditures of $8 at Red Chris, $12 at Peñasquito, $6 at Merian, $17 at Cerro Negro, $3 at Boddington, $21 at Tanami, $36 at Ahafo, $10 at NGM, $70 at Corporate and Other, $4 at CC&V, $1 at Porcupine, $4 at Akyem, and $3 at Telfer, totaling $195 related to developing new operations or major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation.\n(6)\nOther expense, net is adjusted for Newcrest transaction-related costs of $72, settlement costs of $44, and restructuring and severance costs of $38, included in \nOther expense, net\n.\n(7)\nExcludes capitalized interest related to sustaining capital expenditures.

These accounting estimates require the application of significant management judgment and are critical due to the significant level of estimation uncertainty regarding the assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. We base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with GAAP. However, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may materially differ from the estimates we calculate due to changes in circumstances, global economics and politics, and general business conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, while transaction and integration costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the purchase consideration when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill. For material acquisitions, we engage independent appraisers to assist with the determination of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest, if any, and goodwill, based on recognized business valuation methodologies. An income, market or cost valuation method may be utilized to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interest, if any, in a business combination. The income valuation method represents the present value of future cash flows over the life of the asset using: (i) discrete financial forecasts, which rely on management’s estimates of reserves, resources and exploration potential quantities, costs to produce and develop reserves, revenues, and operating expenses; (ii) short-term and long-term metal price assumptions, (iii) long-term growth rates; (iv) appropriate discount rates; and (v) expected future capital requirements (“income valuation method”). The market valuation method uses prices paid for a similar asset by other purchasers in the market, normalized for any differences between the assets (“market valuation method”). The cost valuation method is based on the replacement cost of a comparable asset at the time of the acquisition adjusted for depreciation and economic and functional obsolescence of the asset (“cost valuation method”). If the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurs, an estimate is recorded. Subsequent to the acquisition date, and not later than one year from the acquisition date, we record any material adjustments to the initial estimate based on new information obtained that would have existed as of the date of the acquisition. Any adjustment that arises from information obtained that did not exist as of the date of the acquisition is recorded in the period the adjustments arises.\nCarrying value of long-lived assets\nWe review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Significant negative industry or economic trends, adverse social or political developments, declines in our market capitalization, geotechnical difficulties, reduced estimates of future cash flows from our reporting segments or other disruptions to our business are a few examples of events that we monitor, as they could indicate that the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets, including development projects, may not be recoverable. In such cases, a recoverability test may be necessary to determine if an impairment charge is required.\nFor development projects, including our Conga project which is discussed further below, we review and evaluate changes to project plans and timing to determine continued technical, economic and social viability of the projects. If the Company determines to \n121\nTable of Contents\nsell or abandon a project due to uncertainty from changes in circumstances related to technical, economic, social, political or community factors, or other evolving circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, then a recoverability test is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded.\nAn impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment and their carrying amounts. Fair value is typically determined through the use of an income approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are primarily considered Level 3 fair value measurements. Occasionally, such as when an asset is held for sale, market prices are used. We believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use.\nThe estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of our mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and our projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable mineral reserve estimates; estimated future closure costs; the use of appropriate discount rates; and applicable U.S. dollar long-term exchange rates. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at December 31, 2024 is a long-term gold price of $1,900 per ounce. A decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, of up to approximately $1,039 before consideration of other value beyond proven and probable reserves which may significantly decrease the amount of any potential impairment charge.\nAs discussed above under Depreciation and amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves which could impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified measured, indicated and inferred resources could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling.\nEvents that could result in additional impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in future metal prices, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, increases in future closure costs, and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site cash flows.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Each operating mine is considered a distinct reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. \nThe Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment when it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its carrying value. At the Company's election or if it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using either the income approach utilizing estimates of discounted future cash flows or the market valuation approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Any impairment loss recognized in the current period is not reversed in future periods. The Company recognizes its pro rata share of goodwill and any subsequent goodwill impairment losses recorded by entities that are proportionately consolidated.\nWhen the income approach is utilized to determine fair value, the estimated cash flows used to assess the fair value of a reporting unit are derived from the Company’s current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. The significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at December 31, 2024 is a long-term gold price of $1,900 per ounce. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable estimates; estimated future closure costs; the use of appropriate discount rates; and applicable U.S. dollar long-term exchange rates. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. For testing purposes of our reporting units, management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. However, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be \n122\nTable of Contents\nexpected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, such items as: (i) a decrease in forecasted production levels if we are unable to realize the mineable reserves, resources and exploration potential at our mining properties and extend the life of mine (ii) increased production or capital costs (iii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions including the market price of metals and changes in the equity and debt markets or country specific factors which could result in higher discount rates, (iv) significant unfavorable changes in tax rates including increased corporate income or mining tax rates, and (v) negative changes in regulation, legislation, and political environments which could impact our ability to operate in the future. Refer to Notes 7 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding goodwill. \nCarrying value of Conga\nWe review and evaluate the Company’s Conga development project for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We have considered a variety of technical, economic, social and political developments related to the Conga project during our evaluation of impairment indicators since November 2011, when construction and development activities at the project were largely suspended. Project activities in recent years have focused on continued engagement with the local communities and maintaining and protecting existing project infrastructure and equipment through our active care and maintenance program. Although we have reclassified Conga reserves to resources and reallocated exploration and development capital to other projects, we continue to evaluate long-term options to progress development of the Conga project and improve social and political acceptance. While we have reprioritized the Yanacocha Sulfides project ahead of the Conga project, we have delayed the full-funds decision and are currently in the process of assessing project plan options for the Yanacocha Sulfides project. The Company also periodically updates the economic model for its Conga project to understand changes to the estimated capital costs, cash flows, and economic returns from the project. As of December 31, 2024, we have not identified events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the Conga project is not recoverable. \nReclamation and remediation obligations\nThe Company records the estimated asset retirement obligations associated with operating and non-operating mine sites when an obligation is incurred and the estimated costs can be reasonably measured. Fair value is measured as the present value of expected cash flow estimates, after considering inflation, our credit-adjusted risk-free rates and a market risk premium appropriate for our operations. Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on our best estimate of when the expected spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. Our cost estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation to retire long-lived assets in the period incurred. Changes in reclamation estimates at non-operating mines where the mine or portion of the mine site has entered the closure phase and has no substantive future economic value are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Costs included in estimated asset retirement obligations are discounted to their present value and are estimated over a period of up to fifty years. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine.\nRemediation costs are accrued when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in remediation estimates at non-operating mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Water treatment costs included in environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value and are estimated over a period of up to fifty years.\nAccounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs the Company expects to incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying inputs and assumptions. Such changes, including, but not limited to, (i) changes to environmental laws and regulations, which could increase the scope and extent of work required, (ii) changes in the timing of reclamation and remediation activities, which could occur over an extended future period and (iii) changes in the methods and technology utilized to settle reclamation and remediation obligations, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRefer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding reclamation and remediation obligations.\nIncome and mining taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for us, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. We derive our deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. The financial statement effects of changes in tax law are recorded as discrete items in the period enacted as part of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, regardless of the category of income or loss to which the deferred taxes relate. We have exposure to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tax positions in certain jurisdictions, such movements are recorded within \nIncome and mining tax benefit (expense)\n related to deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as non-current uncertain tax positions, while foreign exchange fluctuations impacting current tax positions are recorded within \nOther income (loss), net\n as foreign currency \n123\nTable of Contents\nexchange gains (losses). With respect to the earnings that we derive from the operations of our consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of these consolidated companies.\nMining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits.\nOur operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. We are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in \nIncome and mining tax benefit (expense)\n. In certain jurisdictions, we must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is ultimately collectible.\nValuation of deferred tax assets\nOur deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. We record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. We review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence.\nCertain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. We look to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date or the expectation of future pretax losses and the existence and frequency of prior cumulative pretax losses.\nWe utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years. Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. However, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. We also consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis.\nOther factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to:\n•\nEarnings history;\n•\nProjected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices;\n•\nThe duration of statutory carry forward periods;\n•\nPrudent and feasible tax planning strategies readily available that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary difference;\n•\nNature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and\n•\nThe sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors.\nThe Company assesses available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence is recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence including projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded in Peru and Argentina. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.\nRefer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the valuation allowance. \nFor additional risk factors that could impact the Company’s ability to realize the deferred tax assets, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n124\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7A.       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n \n(dollars in millions, except per ounce and per pound amounts)\nMetal Prices\nChanges in the market price of gold significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the USD; inflation, deflation, or other general price instability; and global mine production levels. Changes in the market price of copper, silver, lead, and zinc also affect our profitability and cash flow. These metals are traded on established international exchanges and prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. The Company does not currently hold instruments that are designated to hedge against the potential impacts due to market price changes in metals. Consideration of these impacts are discussed below. \nDecreases in the market price of metals can significantly affect the value of our product inventory, stockpiles and leach pads, and it may be necessary to record a write-down to the net realizable value, as well as significantly impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets and goodwill. For information concerning the sensitivity of our impairment analysis over long-lived assets and goodwill to changes in metal price, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates within Item 7, MD&A, and Notes 2, 7 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nNet realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of our stockpiles, leach pads and product inventory include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The significant assumptions in determining the stockpile, leach pad and product inventory adjustments for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2024 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, and the following short-term and long-term assumptions:\nShort-term\nLong-term\nGold price (per ounce)\n$\n2,663 \n$\n1,900 \nCopper price (per pound)\n$\n4.17 \n$\n4.00 \nSilver price (per ounce)\n$\n31.38 \n$\n25.00 \nLead price (per pound)\n$\n0.91 \n$\n0.90 \nZinc price (per pound)\n$\n1.38 \n$\n1.25 \nAUD to USD exchange rate\n$\n0.65 \n$\n0.70 \nCAD to USD exchange rate\n$\n0.71 \n$\n0.75 \nMXN to USD exchange rate\n$\n0.05 \n$\n0.05 \nThe net realizable value measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. For information concerning the sensitivity of our stockpiles and ore on leach pads to changes in metal price, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates within Item 7, MD&A.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk related to the fair value of our senior notes which is wholly comprised of fixed rates at December 31, 2024. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. The terms of our fixed rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity which could be material. Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information pertaining to the fair value of our fixed rate debt. \nForeign Currency\nWe have significant operations and/or assets in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Ecuador, Fiji and Ghana. All of our operations sell their gold, copper, silver, lead, and zinc production based on USD metal prices. Foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic conditions. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins, cash flow and \nCosts applicable to sales\n per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. \n125\nTable of Contents\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact to \nCosts applicable to sales \nper ounce arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement to local currency exchange rates at December 31, 2024 in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations, with no mitigation assumed from our foreign currency cash flow hedges. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement would result in an approximate $71 increase to \nCosts applicable to sales \nper gold ounce at December 31, 2024.\nCommodity Price Exposure\nOur provisional concentrate sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the respective metal concentrates at the prevailing indices’ prices at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which is not designated for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.\nWe perform an analysis on the provisional concentrate sales to determine the potential impact to \nNet income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders \nfor each 10% change to the average price on the provisional concentrate sales subject to final pricing over the next several months. Refer below for our analysis as of December 31, 2024.\nProvisionally Priced Sales Subject to Final Pricing\n (1)\nAverage Provisional \nPrice (per ounce/pound)\nEffect of 10% change in Average Price (millions)\nMarket Closing \nSettlement Price\n (2)\n(per ounce/pound)\nGold (ounces, in thousands) \n265 \n$\n2,635 \n$\n46 \n$\n2,609 \nCopper (pounds, in millions)\n85 \n$\n3.99 \n$\n23 \n$\n3.95 \nSilver (ounces, in millions)\n6 \n$\n28.99 \n$\n12 \n$\n28.91 \nLead (pounds, in millions)\n52 \n$\n0.88 \n$\n3 \n$\n0.87 \nZinc (pounds, in millions)\n114 \n$\n1.34 \n$\n10 \n$\n1.35 \n____________________________\n(1)\nIncludes provisionally priced by-product sales subject to final pricing, which are recognized as a reduction to \nCosts applicable to sales.\n(2)\nThe closing settlement price as of December 31, 2024 is determined utilizing the London Metal Exchange for copper, lead and zinc and the London Bullion Market Association for gold and silver.\nHedging\nThe Company's hedging instruments consisted of the Cadia Power Purchase Agreement (\"Cadia PPA\") and foreign currency cash flow hedges at December 31, 2024, which were transacted for risk management purposes. The Cadia PPA mitigates the variability in future cash flows related to a portion of power purchases at the Cadia mine and the foreign currency cash flow hedges were entered into to mitigate variability in the USD functional cash flows related to the AUD- and CAD-denominated operating expenditures and AUD-denominated capital expenditures. By using hedges, we are affected by market risk, credit risk, and market liquidity risk. \nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in commodity prices or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We mitigate this potential risk to our financial condition by establishing trading agreements with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or be subject to any margin calls on our derivatives. Our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative. \nWe have performed sensitivity analyses as of December 31, 2024 regarding the Cadia PPA and foreign currency cash flow hedges. For the Cadia PPA, we utilized a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the forward electricity rates relative to current rates, with all other variables held constant. For the foreign currency cash flow hedges, we utilized a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the AUD and CAD foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on AUD and CAD market rates in effect at December 31, 2024. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement would result in an approximate decrease in the fair value of the Cadia PPA cash flow hedge and the foreign currency cash flow hedges of $32 and $195 at December 31, 2024, respectively.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. We mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of the counterparties.\n126\nTable of Contents\nMarket Liquidity Risk\nMarket liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. Under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breaches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. We further mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our derivatives over time.\nRefer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative instruments.\n127\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n \n(Ernst & Young LLP; PCAOB ID: \n42\n)\n129\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n(PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP; PCAOB ID: \n271\n)\n131\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n133\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n134\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n135\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n136\nConsolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\n138\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n139\nNote 1 The Company\n139\nNote 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n140\nNote 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures\n151\nNote 4 Segment Information\n154\nNote \n5\n Sales\n159\nNote \n6\n Reclamation and Remediation\n162\nNote \n7\n Impairment Charges\n164\nNote \n8\n Other Expense, Net\n165\nNote \n9\n Other Income\n (Loss)\n, Net\n166\nNote \n10\n Income and Mining Taxes\n166\nNote \n11\n Employee-Related Benefits\n170\nNote \n12\n Stock-Based Compensation\n174\nNote \n13\n Fair Value Accounting\n176\nNote \n14\n Derivative\n Instrument\ns\n179\nNote \n15\n Investments\n182\nNote \n16\n Inventories\n184\nNote \n17\n Stockpiles and Ore on Leach Pads\n185\nNote \n18\n Property, Plant and Mine Development\n185\nNote \n19\n Goodwill\n186\nNote \n20\n Debt\n186\nNote \n21\n Lease and Other Financing Obligations\n188\nNote \n22\n Other Liabilities\n190\nNote \n23\n Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n190\nNote \n24\n Net Change in Operating Assets and Liabilities\n191\nNote \n25\n Commitments and Contingencies\n191\n128\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Newmont Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newmont Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes and the financial statement schedule in Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe did not audit the financial statements of Nevada Gold Mines LLC, a 38.5% owned investment which is proportionately consolidated, whose financial statements reflect total assets constituting 13% and 13% of consolidated assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and sales constituting 13% in 2024, 19% in 2023, and 18% 2022 of the related consolidated totals. Those statements were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Nevada Gold Mines LLC, is based solely on the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework, and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon, based on our audit and the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits and the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n129\nTable of Contents\nReclamation liabilities\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Notes 2, 6 and 25 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Reclamation obligations are recognized when incurred and recorded as liabilities at fair value. Reclamation liabilities are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s consolidated reclamation liabilities totaled $8.5 billion, including $1.5 billion included in liabilities held for sale.\nAuditing management’s accounting for reclamation liabilities was challenging, as significant judgment is required by the Company to estimate required cash flows to meet obligations established by mining permits, local statutes and promissory estoppel at the end of mine life as well as estimation of uncertainty inherent in the cash flows. The significant judgment was primarily related to the inherent estimation uncertainty relating to the extent of future reclamation activities and related costs.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Company’s accounting for reclamation liabilities, including controls over management’s review of estimated future costs and the reclamation liability calculation.\nTo test the reclamation liabilities, among other procedures, we evaluated the methodology, significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its estimate. To assess the estimates of reclamation activities and cash flows, we evaluated significant changes from the prior estimate, verified consistency between timing of reclamation activities and projected mine life, compared anticipated costs across the Company’s mines, verified cost rates against third-party information or internal cost records and recalculated management’s estimate. We also evaluated the significant assumptions included in the fair value calculation, specifically the market risk premium. We involved our reclamation specialists to interview members of the Company’s engineering staff, assess the completeness of the mine reclamation estimates with respect to meeting mine closure and post closure requirements, and evaluate the reasonableness of the engineering estimates and assumptions.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\n \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\nDenver, Colorado\n \nFebruary 20, 2025\n130\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Managers and Members of Nevada Gold Mines LLC\nOpinions on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Nevada Gold Mines LLC and its subsidiaries (the Joint Venture) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, of changes in members’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements) (not presented herein). We also have audited the Joint Venture’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Joint Venture as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Joint Venture maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for opinions\nThe Joint Venture’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (not presented herein). Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Joint Venture’s consolidated financial statements and on the Joint Venture’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Joint Venture in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. \nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical audit matters\n \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Board of Managers (acting in a role equivalent to the audit committee) \n131\nTable of Contents\nand that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \nQualitative goodwill impairment assessment\nAs described in note 2 to the Joint Venture's consolidated financial statements, the Joint Venture’s goodwill balance was $668 million (at a 100 percent economic interest) as of December 31, 2024. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units and assessed for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The Joint Venture has four reporting units. The Joint Venture's management first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount (qualitative goodwill impairment assessment). \nIf it is determined that the fair value is more likely than not to be lower than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. Management uses judgment in assessing the qualitative factors in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit, including significant adverse changes to future gold prices, future operating and capital costs, future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources. Management uses future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by qualified persons (management’s specialists).\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are the judgment by management in assessing the qualitative factors in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing is required, and a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's assessment of qualitative factors in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit with respect to significant adverse changes to future gold prices, future operating and capital costs, future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s qualitative goodwill impairment assessment. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit with respect to significant adverse changes to future gold prices and future operating and capital costs by (i) comparing gold prices to external industry data; (ii) comparing operating and capital costs to recent actual operating and capital costs incurred; and (iii) considering consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. The work of management’s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources. As a basis for using this work, the management's specialists' qualifications were understood and the Joint Venture’s relationship with management’s specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by management’s specialists, tests of the data used by management’s specialists, and an evaluation of management's specialists' findings. \n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants\nToronto, Canada\nFebruary 20, 2025\nWe have served as the Joint Venture’s

The Company has significant operations and/or assets in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Ecuador, Fiji, and Ghana. The cash flow and profitability of the Company’s operations are significantly affected by the market price of gold, copper, silver, lead, and zinc. The prices of gold, copper, silver, lead, and zinc are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company’s control.\nDivestiture of Non-core Assets\nBased on a comprehensive review of the Company’s portfolio of assets following the Newcrest acquisition, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a portfolio optimization program to divest \nsix\n non-core assets and a development project in February 2024. The non-core assets to be divested include Akyem, CC&V, Éléonore, Porcupine, Musselwhite, Telfer, and the Coffee development project in Canada. In February 2024, the Company concluded that these non-core assets and the development project, met the accounting requirements to be presented as held for sale in the first quarter of 2024, based on progress made through the Company's active sales program and management’s expectation that the sale is probable and will be completed within 12 months. \nThe Company entered into definitive agreements in the second half of 2024 to sell the Telfer, Akyem, Musselwhite, Éléonore, and CC&V reportable segments, of which Telfer closed in 2024. Additionally, in January 2025 the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Porcupine reportable segment. Refer to Note 3 for further information on divestitures. \nNewcrest Transaction\nOn November 6, 2023, the Company completed its business combination transaction with Newcrest Mining Limited, a public Australian mining company limited by shares (\"Newcrest\"), whereby Newmont, through Newmont Overseas Holdings Pty Ltd, an Australian proprietary company limited by shares (“Newmont Sub”), acquired all of the ordinary shares of Newcrest in a fully stock transaction for total non-cash consideration of $\n13,549\n. Newcrest became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Sub and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont (such acquisition, the “Newcrest transaction”). The combined company continues to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker NEM. The combined company is also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker NGT, on the Australian Securities Exchange under the ticker NEM, and on the Papua New Guinea Securities Exchange under the ticker NEM. Refer to Note 3 for further information.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nMerian\nNewmont has a \n75\n% economic interest in Suriname Gold project C.V. (“Merian”), with the remaining interests held by Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. (“Staatsolie”), a company wholly owned by the Republic of Suriname. Newmont consolidates Merian, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Newmont Suriname LLC., in its Consolidated Financial Statements as the primary beneficiary of Merian, which is a variable interest entity. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized income of $\n33\n, $\n27\n, and $\n59\n, respectively, within \nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n related to Merian. \nYanacocha\nAt December 31, 2021, Newmont held a \n51.35\n% ownership interest in Minera Yanacocha S.R.L (\"Yanacocha\") and consolidated Yanacocha in its Consolidated Financial Statements under the voting interest model. In 2022, the Company acquired the \n5\n% ownership interest held in Yanacocha by Sumitomo Corporation (“Sumitomo”) in exchange for cash consideration of $\n48\n. Additionally in 2022, the Company acquired the remaining \n43.65\n% interest in Yanacocha held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”), resulting in the Company holding \n100\n% ownership interest in Yanacocha. The Company acquired Buenaventura’s \n43.65\n% noncontrolling interest in Yanacocha (the “Yanacocha Transaction”) for $\n300\n cash consideration, certain royalties on any production from other future potential projects, and contingent payments of up to $\n100\n tied to higher metal prices, achieving commercial production at the Yanacocha Sulfides project and resolution on the outstanding Yanacocha tax dispute. The Yanacocha Transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction, resulting in a decrease to additional paid-in-capital and no gain or loss recognition.\nConcurrent with the Yanacocha Transaction, the Company sold its \n46.94\n% ownership interest in Minera La Zanja S.R.L. (\"La Zanja\"), accounted for as an equity method investment with a carrying value of $\n—\n as of December 31, 2021. Per the terms of the sale, the Company sold its interest in La Zanja to Buenaventura, the parent company of La Zanja, in exchange for royalties on potential future production from the La Zanja operation and contributed cash of $\n45\n to be used exclusively for reclamation costs at the La Zanja operation. Upon close of the sale in 2022, the Company recognized a $\n45\n loss on sale of its equity interest, included in\n Other income (loss), net\n.\n139\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $(\n1\n) of \nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n related to Yanacocha. No \nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n related to Yanacocha was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, as the Company held \n100\n% ownership interest in Yanacocha.\nDiscontinued Operations\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations\n included results related to the Batu Hijau and Elang contingent consideration assets obtained in connection with the sale of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara in 2016. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Batu and Elang contingent consideration assets for cash consideration of $\n153\n, resulting in a gain of $\n15\n included in \nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations\n.\n \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded income of $\n68\n, $\n27\n, and $\n30\n, net of a tax benefit (expense) of $\n31\n, $(\n5\n) and $(\n4\n), respectively, within \nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations\n. The Company received $\n45\n, $\n9\n and $\n22\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to discontinued operations. Refer to contingent consideration assets in Note 14 for additional information.\nNOTE 2     \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRisks and Uncertainties\nAs a global mining company, the Company’s revenue, profitability, and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing metal prices, primarily for gold, but also for copper, silver, lead, and zinc. Historically, the commodity markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital and on the quantities of reserves that the Company can economically produce. The carrying value of the Company’s \nProperty, plant and mine development\n, \nnet;\n \nInventories;\n \nStockpiles and ore on leach pads; Investments; \ncertain \nDerivative assets\n; \nDeferred income tax assets;\n and \nGoodwill\n are particularly sensitive to the outlook for commodity prices. A decline in the Company’s price outlook from current levels could result in material impairment charges related to these assets.\nThe Company's global operations expose it to risks associated with public health crises, geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures, including but not limited to inflationary conditions, as well as the effects of certain countermeasures taken by central banks, supply chain disruptions resulting from global conflicts and other global events, and an uncertain and evolving labor market. \nThe following factors could have further potential short- and, possibly, long-term material adverse impacts on the Company including, but not limited to, volatility in commodity prices and the prices for gold and other metals, changes in the equity and debt markets or country specific factors adversely impacting discount rates, significant cost inflation impacts on production, capital and asset retirement costs, logistical challenges, workforce interruptions and financial market disruptions, energy market disruptions, as well as potential impacts to estimated costs and timing of projects. Refer to Note 7 for further information on certain impairment charges incurred as a result of these challenging conditions.\nAs further response to the current market conditions, high inflation rates, the rising prices for commodities and raw materials, prolonged supply chain disruptions, competitive labor markets, and consideration of capital allocation, the Company has chosen to continue deferring the investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project. While the Company has extended the timeline of the full-funds decision, assessment of the project remains a priority in Peru as the Company continued to advance engineering and long-term procurement activities. The delay of the Yanacocha Sulfides project is intended to focus funds on current operations and other capital commitments while management assesses execution and project options, up to and including transitioning Yanacocha operations into full closure. To the extent that assessment determines that the project is no longer sufficiently profitable or economically feasible under the Company’s internal requirements, it would result in negative modifications to the Company's proven and probable reserves. Additionally, should the Company ultimately decide to forgo the development of Yanacocha Sulfides, the current carrying value of the assets under construction and other long-lived assets of the Yanacocha operations could become impaired and the timing of certain closure activities would be accelerated. As of December 31, 2024, the Yanacocha operations have total long-lived assets of approximately $\n1,195\n, inclusive of approximately $\n827\n of assets under construction related to Yanacocha Sulfides. \nFurthermore, the Company continues to hold the Conga project in Peru, which the Company does not currently anticipate developing in the next ten years as the Company continues to assess Yanacocha Sulfides; accordingly, the Conga project remains in care and maintenance. Should the Company be unable to develop the Conga project or conclude that future development is not in the best interest of the business, the Company may consider other alternatives for the project, which may result in a future impairment charge for the remaining assets. The total assets at Conga were $\n892\n and $\n895\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company's global operations also expose it to foreign currency exchange rates which can increase or decrease profits to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies, including the Australian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the Argentine peso, the Peruvian sol, the Surinamese dollar, the Ghanaian cedi, and the Papua New Guinean kina. Certain mines are located in hyperinflationary economies, which included the Ahafo, Akyem, Cerro Negro, and Merian mines at December 31, 2024. The majority of the activity at these mines has historically been denominated in USD; as a result, the devaluation of the related currency has resulted in \n140\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nan immaterial impact on the Company's financial statements. Therefore, future devaluation of these currencies is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nThe Cerro Negro mine, located in Argentina, is a USD functional currency entity. Argentina’s central bank has enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency, including requiring the Company to convert USD proceeds from metal sales to local currency and restricting payments to foreign-related entities denominated in foreign currency, such as dividends or distributions to the parent and related companies. The Company continues to monitor the foreign currency exposure risk and the limitations of repatriating cash to the United States. Currently, these currency controls are not expected to impact the Company's ability to repay its debt obligations or declare dividends.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information used is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates utilized in impairment calculations and units-of-production amortization calculations; environmental remediation, reclamation and closure obligations; estimates of recoverable gold and other minerals in stockpile and leach pad inventories; estimates of fair value for certain reporting units and asset impairments (including impairments of long-lived assets, goodwill and investments); write-downs of inventory, stockpiles and ore on leach pads to net realizable value; post-employment, post-retirement and other employee benefit liabilities; valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; provisional amounts related to income tax effects of newly enacted tax laws; provisional amounts related to uncertain tax positions; valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination; valuation of assets held for sale; reserves for contingencies and litigation; and the fair value and accounting treatment of financial instruments including marketable and other equity securities and derivative instruments. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results will differ from those amounts estimated in these financial statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Newmont Corporation, more-than-50%-owned subsidiaries that it controls and variable interest entities where it is the primary beneficiary. The proportionate consolidation method is used for investments in which the Company has an undivided interest in the assets, liabilities and operations and for certain unincorporated joint ventures in the extractive industry. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Equity method accounting is applied for certain entities where the Company does not have control, but does have significant influence over the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ operations and financial performance. The functional currency for the majority of the Company’s operations is the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company follows the ASC guidance for identification and reporting of entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. The guidance defines such entities as Variable Interest Entities.\nBusiness Combination and Asset Acquisition Accounting\nThe Company applies a screen test to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination.\nWhen an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business combination because either: (i) substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset, or group of similar identified assets, or (ii) the acquired entity does not have an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the Company accounts for the acquisition as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, goodwill is not recognized, but rather, any excess purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets as of the acquisition date and any direct acquisition-related transaction costs are capitalized as part of the purchase consideration.\nWhen an acquisition is accounted for as a business combination, the Company recognizes and measures the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, while transaction and integration costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the purchase consideration in excess of the aggregate fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill. For material acquisitions, the Company engages independent appraisers to assist with the determination of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest, if any, and goodwill, based on recognized business valuation methodologies. An income, market or cost valuation method may be \n141\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nutilized to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interest, if any, in a business combination. The income valuation method represents the present value of future cash flows over the life of the asset using discrete financial forecasts, long-term growth rates, appropriate discount rates, and expected future capital requirements. The market valuation method uses prices paid for a similar asset by other purchasers in the market, normalized for any differences between the assets. The cost valuation method is based on the replacement cost of a comparable asset at the time of the acquisition adjusted for depreciation and economic and functional obsolescence of the asset. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the period the adjustment arises.\nAssets Held for Sale\nWe classify long-lived assets, or disposal groups comprising of assets and liabilities, as held for sale in the period in which the following six criteria are met, (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nThe Company ceases depreciation and amortization on long-lived assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale, and measures them at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less cost to sell.\nIn determining the fair value of the assets less costs to sell, the Company considers factors including current sales prices for comparable assets, discounted cash flow projections, third party valuations and indicative offer information, if applicable. The Company’s assumptions about fair value require significant judgment because the current market is sensitive to changes in economic conditions, as well as asset-specific considerations. The Company estimates the fair value of assets held for sale based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management, which may differ from actual results and could result in future impairments if market conditions deteriorate. \nAn impairment loss on the initial classification and subsequent measurement of an asset held for sale is recognized as an expense. Any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell (not exceeding the accumulated impairment loss that has been previously recognized) is recognized as a reversal of expense. The Company continues to evaluate the fair value of assets held for sale and monitors market conditions and other economic factors, which could result in additional impairments in the future.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Because of the short maturity of these investments, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are held in overnight bank deposits or are invested in United States Treasury securities and money market securities. Restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash equivalents and is included in other current or non-current assets. Restricted cash is held primarily for the purpose of settling asset retirement obligations.\nStockpiles, Ore on Leach Pads and Inventories\nAs described below, costs that are incurred in or benefit the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on current and long-term metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. Write-downs of stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories to net realizable value are reported as a component of \nCosts applicable to sales\n and \nDepreciation and amortization\n. The current portion of stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories is determined based on the expected amounts to be processed within the next 12 months and utilize the short-term metal price assumption in estimating net realizable value. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories not expected to be processed within the next 12 months are classified as non-current and utilize the long-term metal price assumption in estimating net realizable value. The major classifications are as follows:\nStockpiles\nStockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. The Company generally processes the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of metal stockpiles may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. Processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. Sulfide copper ores are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data) and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs incurred including applicable overhead and \n142\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\ndepreciation and amortization relating to mining operations and removed at each stockpile’s average cost per recoverable unit as material is processed. Carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly, in accordance with the above.\nOre on Leach Pads\nOre on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold or silver or extract the copper. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces or pounds are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold or silver or pound of copper on the leach pad. Estimates of recoverable ore on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between \n50\n% and \n95\n% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete.\nAlthough the quantities of recoverable metal placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of metal actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, the Company’s operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of metal on its leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis.\nIn-process Inventory\nIn-process inventories represent material that is currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion processes vary depending on the nature of the ore and the specific processing facility, but include mill in-circuit, flotation, leach and carbon-in-leach. In-process material is measured based on assays of the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of the respective processing plants. In-process inventories are valued at the lower of the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines, stockpiles and/or leach pads, plus the in-process conversion costs, including applicable amortization relating to the process facilities incurred to that point in the process or net realizable value.\nPrecious Metals Inventory\nPrecious metals inventories include gold doré and/or gold bullion. Precious metals that result from the Company’s mining and processing activities are valued at the lower of the average cost of the respective in-process inventories incurred prior to the refining process, plus applicable refining costs or net realizable value.\nConcentrate Inventory\nConcentrate inventories represent gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper concentrate available for shipment or in transit for further processing when the sales process has not been completed. The Company values concentrate inventory at average cost, including an allocable portion of support costs and amortization. Costs are added and removed to the concentrate inventory based on metal in the concentrate and are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.\nMaterials and Supplies\nMaterials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and freight.\nProperty, Plant and Mine Development\nFacilities and Equipment\nExpenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and recorded at cost. Facilities and equipment acquired as a part of a finance lease, build-to-suit or other financing arrangement are capitalized and recorded based on the contractual lease terms. The facilities and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such capitalized costs over the estimated productive lives of such facilities. These estimated productive lives do not exceed the related estimated mine lives, which are based on proven and probable reserves.\nMine Development\nMine development costs include engineering and metallurgical studies, drilling and other related costs to delineate an ore body, the removal of overburden to initially expose an ore body at open pit surface mines and the building of access ways, shafts, lateral access, drifts, ramps and other infrastructure at underground mines. Costs incurred before mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves are expensed and classified as \nExploration\n or\n Advanced projects, research and development \nexpense. \n143\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nCapitalization of mine development project costs that meet the definition of an asset begins once mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves.\nDrilling and related costs are capitalized for an ore body where proven and probable reserves exist and the activities are directed at obtaining additional information on the ore body or converting measured, indicated and inferred resources to proven and probable reserves. All other drilling and related costs are expensed as incurred. Drilling costs incurred during the production phase for operational ore control are allocated to inventory costs and then included as a component of \nCosts applicable to sales\n.\nThe cost of removing overburden and waste materials to access the ore body at an open pit mine prior to the production phase are referred to as “pre-stripping costs.” Pre-stripping costs are capitalized during the development of an open pit mine. Where multiple open pits exist at a mining complex utilizing common processing facilities, pre-stripping costs are capitalized at each pit. The removal, production, and sale of de minimis saleable materials may occur during the development phase of an open pit mine and are assigned incremental mining costs related to the removal of that material.\nThe production phase of an open pit mine commences when saleable minerals, beyond a de minimis amount, are produced. Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that are included as a component of inventory to be recognized in \nCosts applicable to sales\n in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory.\nMine development costs are amortized using the units-of-production method based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves. To the extent that these costs benefit an entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated life of the ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that area are amortized over the estimated life of that specific ore block or area.\nUnderground development costs incurred before mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves are expensed and classified as \nExploration\n or \nAdvanced projects, research and development \nexpense. Capitalization of mine development project costs that meet the definition of an asset begins once mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves.\nMineral Interests\nMineral interests include acquired interests in production, development and exploration stage properties. Mineral interests are capitalized at their fair value at the acquisition date, either as an individual asset purchase or as part of a business combination. Mineral interests in the development and exploration stage are not amortized until the underlying property is converted to the production stage, at which point the mineral interests are amortized over the estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves.\nThe value of such assets is primarily driven by the nature and amount of mineral interests believed to be contained in such properties. Production stage mineral interests represent interests in operating properties that contain proven and probable reserves and are amortized using the units-of-production method based on the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves. Development stage mineral interests represent interests in properties under development that contain proven and probable reserves. Exploration stage mineral interests represent interests in properties that are believed to potentially contain mineral resources consisting of (i) mineral resources within pits; mineral resources with insufficient drill spacing to qualify as proven and probable reserves; and mineral resources in close proximity to proven and probable reserves; (ii) around-mine exploration potential not immediately adjacent to existing reserves and mineralization, but located within the immediate mine area; (iii) other mine-related exploration potential that is not part of current resources and is comprised mainly of material outside of the immediate mine area; (iv) greenfield exploration potential that is not associated with any other production, development or exploration stage property, as described above; or (v) any acquired right to explore or extract a potential mineral deposit. The Company’s mineral rights generally are enforceable regardless of whether proven and probable reserves have been established. In certain limited situations, the nature of a mineral right changes from an exploration right to a mining right upon the establishment of proven and probable reserves. The Company has the ability and intent to renew mineral interests where the existing term is not sufficient to recover all identified and valued proven and probable reserves and/or undeveloped mineral resources.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment annually as of December 31 and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Each operating mine is considered a distinct reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.\nThe Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment when it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its carrying value. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using either the income approach utilizing estimates of discounted future cash flows or the market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company recognizes its pro rata share of goodwill and any subsequent goodwill impairment losses recorded by entities that are proportionately consolidated.\n144\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nThe estimated cash flows used to assess the fair value of a reporting unit are derived from the Company’s current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; capital investments; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable mineral reserve estimates; estimated future closure costs; the use of appropriate discount rates; and applicable U.S. dollar long-term exchange rates.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment, and their carrying amounts. Fair value is typically determined through the use of an income approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. Occasionally, such as when an asset is held for sale, market prices are used.\nThe estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of the Company’s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management’s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserve estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable mineral reserve estimates; estimated future closure costs; and the use of appropriate discount rates.\nIn estimating undiscounted cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of undiscounted cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual cash flows may differ significantly from estimates, as actual produced reserves, metal prices, commodity-based and other costs, and closure costs are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\nInvestments\nTime Deposits\nTime deposits with an original maturity of more than three months but less than one year are included within \nInvestments\n. These time deposits are carried at amortized cost. Accrued interest is recorded in \nOther income (loss), net\n. \nEquity Method Investments\nManagement classifies investments at the acquisition date and re-evaluates the classification at each balance sheet date and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a change in the Company’s ability to exercise significant influence. The ability to exercise significant influence is typically presumed when the Company possesses 20% or more of the voting interests in the investee. The Company accounts for its investments in stock of other entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control, using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company increases its investment for contributions made and records its proportionate share of net earnings, declared dividends and partnership distributions based on the most recently available financial statements of the investee. To the extent that there is a basis difference between the amount invested and the underlying equity in the net assets of an equity investment, the Company allocates such differences between tangible and intangible assets. This basis difference is being amortized into \nEquity income (loss) of affiliates\n over the remaining estimated useful lives of the underlying tangible and intangible net assets. The Company from time to time will elect the fair value option to account for its equity method investments if the fair value option better reflects the economics of its investment. Equity method investments accounted for under the fair value option are remeasured periodically with any changes in fair value recorded in \nOther income (loss), net. \nEquity method investments are included in \nInvestments\n.\nContributions made to equity method investees at times are in the form of loan agreements. Loans provided to equity method investees that are made based on the Company's proportionate ownership percentage are accounted for as “in-substance capital contributions” and are treated as an increase to the investment. Principal and interest payments received on loans treated as in-substance capital contributions are assessed under the cumulative earnings approach to determine if the distribution received represents a return on capital or a return of capital. Return on capital distributions are recorded as an operating cash flow whereas return of capital distributions are recorded as an investing cash flow. Loans provided to equity method investees that are not made on a proportionate basis are accounted for as a loan receivable and do not increase the investment. Principal payments received on loans not treated as an in-substance capital contribution are accounted for as a reduction to the loan receivable and interest received is recorded as interest income. \n The Company evaluates its equity method investments for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is an other-than-temporary decline in the value of the investment. Declines in fair value that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are charged to \nOther income (loss), net\n. \n145\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nMarketable Equity, Debt, and Other Equity Securities\nThe Company has certain marketable equity and debt securities and other equity securities. Marketable equity securities are measured primarily at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded in \nOther income (loss), net\n. Certain other equity securities are accounted for under the measurement alternative (cost less impairment, adjusted for any qualifying observable price changes) when fair value is not readily determinable. The Company accounts for its restricted marketable debt securities as available-for-sale securities. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, net of taxes, are reported as a component of\n Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n in\n Total equity\n, unless an impairment is deemed to be credit-related. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to \nOther income (loss), net\n.\n \nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company holds derivatives for risk management purposes rather than for trading. The Company uses derivatives to mitigate uncertainty and volatility caused by underlying exposures to foreign exchange rates and energy prices. The fair values of all derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and are reported gross. \nFinancial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative, but are not designated for hedge accounting under ASC 815, are accounted for at fair value using derivative pricing models. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including long term metal prices, life of mine production profiles, discount rates, and inflation assumptions. These instruments are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date with the resulting gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \nCash Flow Hedges\nThe fair value of derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are reflected as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The changes in fair value of these hedges are deferred in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n. Amounts deferred in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n are reclassified to income when the hedged transaction has occurred in the same income statement line where the earnings effect of the hedged item is presented. Cash transactions related to the Company’s derivative contracts accounted for as hedges are classified in the same category as the item being hedged in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nWhen derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are settled, accelerated or restructured before the maturity date of the contracts, the related amount in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \nat the settlement date is deferred and reclassified to earnings, when the originally designated hedged transaction impacts earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item, unless the underlying hedge transaction becomes probable of not occurring, at which time related amounts in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n are reclassified to earnings immediately.\nDebt\nThe Company carries its Senior Notes at amortized cost.\nDebt issuance costs and debt premiums and discounts, which are included in \nDebt,\n are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective Senior Notes as a component of \nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest\n within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGain or loss on extinguishment of debt is recorded as a component of \nOther income (loss), net\n upon the extinguishment of a debt instrument and is calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and net carrying amount of the debt, which includes unamortized debt issuance costs. The Company evaluates all changes to its debt arrangements to determine whether the changes represent a modification or extinguishment to the old debt arrangement. If a debt instrument is deemed to be modified, the Company capitalizes all new lender fees and expenses all third-party fees. If it is determined that an extinguishment of one of the Company's debt instruments has occurred, the unamortized financing fees associated with the extinguished instrument are expensed. For the revolving loans, all lender and third-party fees are capitalized, and in the event an amendment reduces the committed capacity under the revolving loans, the Company will expense a portion of any unamortized fees on a pro-rata basis in proportion to the decrease in the committed capacity.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if a contractual arrangement represents or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in \nOther non-current assets\n and \nOther current\n \nand\n \nnon-current liabilities\n \nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in \nProperty, plant and mine development, net\n and \ncurrent\n and \nnon-current \nLease and other financing obligations\n in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOperating and finance lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. Leases acquired in a business combination are also measured based on the present value of the remaining leases payments, as if the acquired lease were a new lease at the acquisition date. When the rate implicit to the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in \n146\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\ndetermining the present value of the future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date and represents the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The ROU asset includes any lease payments made and lease incentives received prior to the commencement date. Operating lease ROU assets also include any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent when the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term. The ROU assets and lease liabilities may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nThe Company has lease arrangements that include both lease and non-lease components. The Company accounts for each separate lease component and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component for the majority of its asset classes. Additionally, for certain lease arrangements that involve leases of similar assets, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the underlying ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nCommon Stock\nNewmont filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 under which it can issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices, subject to the limitations of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company's certification of incorporation and bylaws. It also includes the ability to resell an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities. \nTreasury Stock\nThe Company records repurchases of common shares as \nTreasury stock\n at cost and records any subsequent retirements of treasury shares at cost. When treasury shares are retired, the Company’s policy is to allocate the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired to both \nRetained earnings\n and \nAdditional paid-in capital \nusing settlement-date accounting. The portion allocated to \nAdditional paid-in capital\n is calculated on a pro rata basis of the shares to be retired and the total shares issued and outstanding as of the date of the retirement.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired approximately \n26\n million shares of its common stock for $\n1,246\n. \nNo\n repurchases occurred during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company withheld \n0.4\n million, \n0.6\n million and \n0.6\n million shares, respectively, for payments of employee withholding taxes related to the vesting of stock awards.\nRevenue Recognition\nNewmont generates revenue by selling gold, copper, silver, lead, and zinc produced from its mining operations. Refer to Note 4 for further information regarding the Company’s operating segments.\nThe majority of the Company’s \nSales\n come from the sale of refined gold; however, the end product at the Company’s gold operations is generally doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of \n99.95\n% gold. Under the terms of the Company’s refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee, and the Company’s share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver is credited to its bullion account. Gold from doré bars credited to its bullion account is typically sold to banks or refiners.\nA portion of gold sold from certain sites is sold in the form of concentrate. The Company’s \nSales \nalso come from the sale of copper, silver, lead, and zinc. Sales from these metals are generally in the form of concentrate, which is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining.\nGenerally, if a metal expected to be mined represents more than \n10\n% to \n20\n% of the life of mine sales value of all the metal expected to be mined, co-product accounting is applied. When the Company applies co-product accounting at an operation, revenue is recognized for each co-product metal sold, and shared costs applicable to sales are allocated based on the relative sales values of the co-product metals produced. Generally, if metal expected to be mined is less than the \n10\n% to \n20\n% of the life of mine sales value, by-product accounting is applied. Revenues from by-product sales, which are immaterial, are credited to \nCosts applicable to sales\n as a by-product credit. Silver, lead and zinc are produced as co-products at Peñasquito. Copper is produced as a co-product at Red Chris, Boddington, Cadia, and Telfer. Aside from the co-product sales at Red Chris, Peñasquito, Boddington, Cadia, and Telfer, copper and silver produced at other Newmont sites are by-product metals.\nGold Sales from Doré Production\nThe Company recognizes revenue for gold from doré production when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring gold inventory to the customer, which generally occurs upon transfer of gold bullion credits as this is the point at which the customer obtains control the ability to direct the use and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits of ownership of the asset.\n147\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nThe Company generally recognizes the sale of gold bullion credits when the credits are delivered to the customer. The transaction price is determined based on the agreed upon market price and the number of ounces delivered. Payment is due upon delivery of gold bullion credits to the customer’s account.\nSales from Concentrate Production\nThe Company recognizes revenue for gold, copper, silver, lead, and zinc from concentrate production, net of treatment and refining charges, when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring control of the concentrate to the customer. This generally occurs as material passes over the vessel's rail at the port of loading based on the date from the bill of lading, as the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the material and the customer has the risk of loss. Newmont has elected to account for shipping and handling costs for concentrate contracts as fulfillment activities and not as promised goods or services; therefore these activities are not considered separate performance obligations.\nThe Company generally sells metal concentrate based on the monthly average market price for a future month, dependent on the relevant contract, following the month in which the delivery to the customer takes place. The amount of revenue recognized for concentrates is initially recorded on a provisional basis based on the forward prices for the estimated month of settlement and the Company’s estimated metal quantities based on assay data. The Company’s sales based on a provisional price contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which is not designated for hedge accounting, is primarily marked to market through \nSales\n each period prior to final settlement. The Company also adjusts estimated metal quantities used in computing provisional sales using new information and assay data from the smelter as it is received (if any).\nA provisional payment is generally due upon delivery of the concentrate to the customer. Final payment is due upon final settlement of price and quantity with the customer.\nThe principal risks associated with recognition of sales on a provisional basis include metal price fluctuations and updated quantities between the date the sale is recorded and the date of final settlement. If a significant decline in metal prices occurs, or assay data results in a significant change in quantity between the provisional pricing date and the final settlement date, it is reasonably possible that the Company could be required to return a portion of the provisional payment received on the sale. Refer to Note 5 for additional information.\nIncome and Mining Taxes \nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of the Company’s liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for the Company, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. The Company derives its deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. The financial statement effects of changes in tax law are recorded as discrete items in the period enacted as part of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, regardless of the category of income or loss to which the deferred taxes relate. The Company determines if the assessment of a particular income tax effect is “complete.” Those effects for which the accounting is determined to be complete are reported in the enactment period financial statements. The Company has exposure to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tax positions in certain jurisdictions, such movements are recorded within \nIncome and mining tax benefit (expense)\n related to deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as non-current uncertain tax positions, while foreign exchange fluctuations impacting current tax positions are recorded within \nOther income (loss), net \nas foreign currency exchange gains (losses). With respect to the earnings that the Company derives from the operations of its consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of these consolidated companies.\nMining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes. As such, taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. \nNewmont’s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. Newmont and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether it is more likely than not, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in \nIncome and mining tax benefit (expense)\n. In certain jurisdictions, Newmont must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if Newmont believes the amount is collectible.\n148\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nThe Company’s deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when it believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. The Company reviews the likelihood that it will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence.\nCertain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. The Company looks to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date, recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. Other factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to:\n•\nEarnings history;\n•\nProjected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices;\n•\nThe duration of statutory carry forward periods;\n•\nPrudent and feasible tax planning strategies readily available that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary difference;\n•\nNature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and\n•\nThe sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors.\nConcluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company utilizes a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of its cumulative results in recent years. However, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis.\nReclamation and Remediation Costs\nReclamation obligations associated with operating and non-operating mine sites are recognized when an obligation is incurred and the estimated costs can be reasonably measured. Fair value is measured as the present value of expected cash flow estimates, after considering inflation, the Company's credit-adjusted risk-free rates and a market risk premium appropriate for the Company's operations. The liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to earnings. In addition, the asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the asset’s carrying value and amortized over the life of the related asset. Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Changes in reclamation estimates at mines that are not currently operating, as the mine or portion of the mine site has entered the closure phase and has no substantive future economic value, are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. The estimated reclamation obligation is based on when spending for an existing disturbance is expected to occur. Costs included in estimated asset retirement obligations are discounted to their present value as cash flows are readily estimable over a period of up to fifty years. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the reclamation obligation at each mine site in accordance with ASC guidance for asset retirement obligations.\nRemediation costs are accrued when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in remediation estimates at operating and non-operating mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Water treatment costs included in environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value as cash flows are readily estimable over a period up to fifty years.\n \nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency for the majority of the Company’s operations is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured at current exchange rates and the resulting adjustments are included in \nOther income (loss), net\n. The financial statements of the Company's foreign entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars with the resulting adjustments charged or credited directly to \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n in \nTotal equity\n. All assets and liabilities are translated into the U.S. dollar using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. The gains or losses on foreign currency rates on cash holdings in foreign currencies are included in \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n149\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation awards exchanged for employee services at fair value on the date of the grant and expenses the awards in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the requisite employee service period. The fair value of RSUs are based on the Newmont stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs with market-related conditions is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of PSUs with performance-related conditions is determined based on the Newmont stock price on the date of grant and the probability of the performance conditions being met. Stock-based compensation expense related to all awards, including awards with a market or performance condition that cliff vest, is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period of the award on a straight-line basis. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. The Company's estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee retirement eligibility dates, the Company's performance and related tax impacts.\nNet Income (Loss) per Common Share\nBasic and diluted income (loss) per share are presented for \nNet income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders\n. Basic income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to Newmont common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per common share is computed similarly except that weighted average common shares is increased to reflect all dilutive instruments, including employee stock awards. Dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding if their effect would be anti-dilutive based on the treasury stock method or due to a net loss from continuing operations.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company reports the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if a disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results when the business is classified as held for sale, in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment and ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations. Under ASC 360, assets may be classified as held for sale even though discontinued operations classification is not met. Equity method investments, which are specifically scoped out of ASC 360, can only be classified as held for sale if discontinued operations classification is also achieved. The results of discontinued operations are reported in \nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for current and prior periods, including any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nIn addition to \nNet income (loss)\n, \nComprehensive income (loss)\n includes all changes in equity during a period, such as adjustments to minimum pension liabilities, foreign currency translation adjustments, changes in fair value of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and cumulative unrecognized changes in fair value of marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale, except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners.\nCare and Maintenance\nThe Company incurs certain direct operating costs and depreciation and amortization costs when operations are temporarily halted and placed in care and maintenance. Direct operating costs incurred while operations are temporarily placed in care and maintenance are included in \nOther expense, net\n as these costs do not benefit the productive process and are not related to sales. Depreciation and amortization costs incurred while operations are temporarily placed in care and maintenance are included in \nDepreciation and amortization\n.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts and disclosures in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2024 presentation.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Securities and Exchange Commission Rules\nSegments Reporting\nIn November 2023, ASU 2023-07 was issued which improves disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and addresses requests from investors and other allocators of capital for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. The ASU applies to all public entities that are required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2024. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nInflation Reduction Act\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \"IRA\") into law. The IRA introduced an excise tax on stock repurchases of 1% of the fair market value of stock repurchases net of stock issued during the tax year and a corporate alternative minimum tax (the \"Corporate AMT\") of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (\"AFSI\") of corporations \n150\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nwith average AFSI exceeding $1 billion over a three-year period. The excise tax on stock repurchases is effective on net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022 and the Corporate AMT is effective for tax periods beginning in fiscal year 2023. While waiting on pending Department of Treasury regulatory guidance, the Company is continuing to monitor developments. Based upon information known to date, no material impacts are expected to the Consolidated Financial Statements, disclosures, or cash flows.\nIn 2024, Pillar II is set to take effect. The Pillar II agreement was signed by 138 countries with the intent to equalize corporate tax around the world by implementing a global minimum tax of 15%. As Newmont primarily does business in jurisdictions with a tax rate greater than 15%, the Company does not anticipate a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Securities and Exchange Commission Rules\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, ASU 2024-03 was issued, requiring additional disclosures in the notes to the financial statements on the nature of certain expense captions presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSEC Climate Rule\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued a final rule that requires registrants to disclose climate-related information in their annual reports and in registration statements. In April 2024, the SEC chose to stay the newly adopted rulemaking pending judicial review of related consolidated Eighth Circuit petitions. If the stay is lifted, certain disclosures may be required in annual reports for the year ending December 31, 2025, filed in 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the rules on its consolidated financial statements.\nImprovement to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, ASU 2023-09 was issued, requiring disaggregated information about the effective tax rate reconciliation and additional information on taxes paid that meet a qualitative threshold. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNOTE 3     \nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nBusiness Acquisition\nOn November 6, 2023 (the “acquisition date”), Newmont completed its business combination transaction with Newcrest, a public Australian mining company limited by shares, whereby Newmont, through Newmont Sub, acquired all of the ordinary shares of Newcrest, pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under Part 5.1 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) between Newcrest and its stockholders, as contemplated by a scheme implementation deed, dated as of May 15, 2023, by and among Newmont, Newmont Sub and Newcrest, as amended from time to time. Upon implementation, Newmont completed the business acquisition of Newcrest, in which Newmont was the acquirer and Newcrest became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Sub and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont (such acquisition, the “Newcrest transaction”). The acquisition of Newcrest increased the Company’s gold and other metal reserves and expanded its operating jurisdictions.\nThe acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of the following:\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\nShares\nPer Share\nPurchase Consideration\nStock Consideration\nShares of Newmont exchanged for Newcrest outstanding ordinary shares\n357,691,627\n \n$\n37.88\n \n$\n13,549\n \nTotal Purchase Price\n$\n13,549\n \nThe Company retained an independent appraiser to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price of Newcrest was allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated acquisition date fair values. The fair value estimates were based on income, market and cost valuation methods. The excess of the total consideration over the estimated fair value of the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill balance is mainly attributable to: (i) the acquisition of existing operating mines with access to an assembled workforce that cannot be duplicated at the same costs by new entrants; (ii) operating synergies anticipated from the integration of the operations of Newmont and Newcrest; and (iii) the application of Newmont’s Full Potential program and potential strategic and financial benefits that include the increase in reserve base and opportunities to identify additional mineralization through exploration activities.\n151\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nIn 2024, the Company completed the analysis to assign fair values to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed. \nThe following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation for the Newcrest transaction:\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n668\n \nTrade receivables\n212\n \nInventories\n723\n \nStockpiles and ore on leach pads\n113\n \nDerivative assets\n42\n \nOther current assets\n193\n \nCurrent assets\n1,951\n \nProperty, plant and mine development, net\n (1)\n13,504\n \nInvestments\n (2)\n990\n \nStockpiles and ore on leach pads\n (3)\n219\n \nDeferred income tax assets \n(4)\n75\n \nGoodwill\n (5)\n2,401\n \nDerivative assets\n362\n \nOther non-current assets\n (6)\n398\n \nTotal assets\n19,900\n \nLIABILITIES\nAccounts payable\n344\n \nEmployee-related benefits\n143\n \nLease and other financing obligations\n16\n \nDebt\n1,923\n \nOther current liabilities\n333\n \nCurrent liabilities\n2,759\n \nDebt\n (7)\n1,373\n \nLease and other financing obligations\n35\n \nReclamation and remediation liabilities\n (8)\n745\n \nDeferred income tax liabilities \n(4)\n1,236\n \nEmployee-related benefits\n192\n \nOther non-current liabilities\n11\n \nTotal liabilities\n6,351\n \nNet assets acquired\n$\n13,549\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nThe fair value of property, plant and mine development is based on applying income, market, and cost valuation methods. Measurement period adjustments of $\n321\n increased \nProperty, plant and mine development, net\n, from the preliminary valuation primarily related to the Canadian, Lihir, and Telfer assets.\n(2)\nThe fair value of the investments was determined by applying the market approach, based on quoted prices for the acquired investments. \n(3)\nThe fair value of stockpiles and ore on leach pads is based on applying the income valuation method. Measurement period adjustments of $\n85\n increased \nStockpiles and ore on leach pads\n from the preliminary valuation primarily relating to the valuation of stockpiles at Lihir. \n(4)\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax benefit or future tax expense associated with the differences between the fair value allocated to assets (excluding the majority of the goodwill balance) and liabilities and a tax basis increase to the fair value of the assets acquired in Australia and the historical carryover tax basis of assets and liabilities in all other jurisdictions. No deferred tax liability is recognized for the basis difference inherent in the fair value allocated to goodwill. Measurement period adjustments resulted in \nDeferred income tax assets\n decreasing by $\n114\n \nand \nDeferred income tax liabilities\n decreasing by $\n95\n from the preliminary valuation.\n(5)\nGoodwill is attributable to the following reportable segments: $\n669\n to Brucejack; $\n539\n to Red Chris; $\n249\n to Cadia; and $\n944\n to Lihir. Measurement period adjustments resulted in an overall reduction to \nGoodwill\n of $\n343\n from the preliminary valuation.\n(6)\nMeasurement period adjustments of $\n305\n increased \nOther non-current assets \nfrom the preliminary valuation primarily due to the recognition of an intangible asset.\n(7)\nThe fair value of the Newcrest senior notes was measured using a market approach, based on quoted prices for the acquired debt.\n(8)\nThe fair value of reclamation and remediation liabilities is based on the expected amounts and timing of cash flows for closure activities and discounted to present value using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate as of the acquisition date. Key assumptions include the costs and timing of key closure activities based on the life of mine plans, including estimates and timing of monitoring and water management costs (if applicable) after the completion of initial closure activities. Measurement period adjustments of $\n352\n increased \nReclamation and remediation liabilities\n.\nSales\n and \nNet income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders\n in the Consolidated Statement of Operations includes Newcrest revenue of $\n944\n and Newcrest net income of $\n136\n from the acquisition date to December 31, 2023.\n152\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nPro Forma Financial Information (unaudited)\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents consolidated results assuming the Newcrest transaction occurred on January 1, 2022.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\n2022\nSales\n$\n15,432\n \n$\n16,418\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders\n (1)\n$\n(\n1,991\n)\n$\n410\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nIncludes $\n464\n of Newcrest transaction and integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDivestitures\nBased on a comprehensive review of the Company’s portfolio of assets, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a portfolio optimization program to divest \nsix\n non-core assets and a development project in February 2024. The non-core assets to be divested include the CC&V, Musselwhite, Porcupine, Éléonore, Telfer, and Akyem reportable segments, and the Coffee development project which is included within the non-operating segment Corporate and Other. The Telfer disposal group also includes the Havieron development project, which was \n70\n% owned by the Company and accounted for under proportionate consolidation, and other related assets. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate net book value of the non-core assets and the development project was $\n3,419\n.\nIn February 2024, based on progress made through the Company's active sales program and management’s expectation that the sale is probable and will be completed within 12 months, the Company concluded that these non-core assets and the development project met the accounting requirements to be presented as held for sale. Upon meeting the requirements to be presented as held for sale, the \nsix\n non-core assets and the development project were recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell, and are periodically valued until sale occurs.\nIn the September 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the assets of Telfer reportable segment, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2024. Refer below for further information on the sale. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell the reportable segments of Akyem, Musselwhite, Éléonore, and CC&V, and in January 2025 the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Porcupine reportable segment, all of which are expected to close in the first half of 2025 and remained designated as held for sale at December 31, 2024.\nTelfer Sale. \nThe Company completed the sale of the assets of the Telfer reportable segment, including its \n70\n% interest in the Havieron development project and other related assets, to Greatland Gold plc (\"Greatland\") on December 4, 2024 (the \"Telfer Sale\"). Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Company received total consideration of $\n453\n, which includes (i) cash consideration of $\n217\n, net of working capital adjustments, (ii) equity consideration of $\n242\n in the form of \n2.7\n billion Greatland shares to be accounted for as an equity method investment for which the Company elected the fair value option, (iii) an option of $\n67\n in which a third party has the option to acquire \n1.3\n billion of the Company's Greatland shares at a set price exercisable for \nfour years\n, accounted for as a financial liability for which the Company elected the fair value option (\"Greatland option\"), and (iv) the potential to receive contingent payments of up to $\n100\n tied to future Havieron production and gold price over a \nfive-year\n period. The contingent payments do not meet the definition of a derivative and are considered to be a financial asset, for which the Company recorded at fair value at completion of the sale, with a fair value of $\n61\n. The agreement is inclusive of transitional services support to be provided by the Company for a \none year\n period following close. \nAs a result of the sale, a loss of $\n160\n is recognized in \nLoss on assets held for sale \nfor the year ended December 31, 2024. Certain working capital adjustments are to be finalized over a period of up to 180 days from completion of the sale. Any resulting revisions will be settled in cash, with an offsetting impact to recognized in \nOther income (loss), net. \nAdjustments are not expected to be material.\nAssets and liabilities held for sale.\n The non-core assets and the development project classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell. These assets are periodically valued until sale occurs with any resulting gain or loss recognized in \nLoss on assets held for sale\n. \nAs a result, for the year ended December 31, 2024 a loss of $\n859\n was recognized within \nLoss on assets held for sale\n, of which $\n160\n and $\n699\n related to Telfer and the disposal groups remaining as held for sale as of December 31, 2024, respectively. The $\n699\n loss on the disposal groups remaining as held for sale resulted in an aggregate net book value of $\n2,432\n at December 31, 2024. A resulting tax impact of $\n255\n was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024, resulting in a total loss of $\n1,114\n recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024, within \nLoss on assets held for sale\n.\nThe estimated fair values of net assets held for sale were determined using the market approach for the Akyem, Musselwhite, Éléonore, CC&V, and Porcupine reportable segments utilizing the respective definitive agreements. The estimated fair value of net assets held for sale for the Coffee development project were determined using the income approach which included the following significant inputs: (i) cash flow estimates, (ii) a short-term gold price of $\n2,700\n per ounce, (iii) a long-term gold price of $\n1,900\n per \n153\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nounce, (iv) current estimates of resources and exploration potential, and (v) a reporting unit specific discount rate of \n9.75\n%. The estimated fair values are considered a non-recurring Level 2 or 3 fair value measurement and additional losses may be incurred as the Company continues to evaluate the definitive sales agreements, as the active sales program progresses, or as fair value estimates change.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of the major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale by disposal group as of December 31, 2024, prior to recognition of the write-down of $\n699\n for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nCC&V\n (1)\nMusselwhite\n (1)\nPorcupine\n (1)\nÉléonore\n (1)\nAkyem\n (1)\nCoffee Project\n (2)\nTotal\nAssets held for sale:\nProperty, plant and mine development, net\n$\n170\n \n$\n1,063\n \n$\n1,541\n \n$\n785\n \n$\n559\n \n$\n321\n \n$\n4,439\n \nOther assets\n408\n \n39\n \n93\n \n70\n \n258\n \n1\n \n869\n \nCarrying value of assets held for sale\n$\n578\n \n$\n1,102\n \n$\n1,634\n \n$\n855\n \n$\n817\n \n$\n322\n \n$\n5,308\n \nLiabilities held for sale:\nReclamation and remediation liabilities\n$\n334\n \n$\n82\n \n$\n563\n \n$\n87\n \n$\n427\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n1,496\n \nOther liabilities\n37\n \n257\n \n223\n \n71\n \n91\n \n2\n \n681\n \nCarrying value of liabilities held for sale\n$\n371\n \n$\n339\n \n$\n786\n \n$\n158\n \n$\n518\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n2,177\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into binding agreements to sell the Akyem, Musselwhite, Éléonore, and CC&V reportable segments. Additionally, in January 2025 the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Porcupine reportable segment. The sales are expected to close in the first half of 2025. \n(2)\nThe Coffee Project is included in the non-operating segment Corporate and Other in Note 4.\nWhile the Company remains committed to a plan to sell these assets for a fair price, there is a possibility that the assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond the Company's control.\n \nNOTE 4     \nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company regularly reviews its segment reporting for alignment with its strategic goals and operational structure as well as for evaluation of business performance and allocation of resources by Newmont’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), which is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company's reportable segments consist of each of its \n16\n mining operations that it manages and its \n38.5\n% proportionate interest in Nevada Gold Mines (\"NGM\") which it does not directly manage. The reportable segments at December 31, 2024 include certain reportable segments that are designated as held for sale and exclude those which have been divested. Refer to Note 3 for further information. \nIn the following tables,\n Income (loss) before income and mining tax and other items\n from reportable segments does not reflect general corporate expenses, interest (except project-specific interest), or income and mining taxes. Intercompany revenue and expense amounts have been eliminated within each segment in order to report on the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment performance. The Company's business activities and operating segments that are not considered reportable, including all equity method investments, are reported in the non-operating segment Corporate and Other, which has been provided for reconciliation purposes.\nThe CODM uses \nIncome (loss) before mining tax and other items\n to evaluate income generated from segment assets in deciding whether to reinvest profits into the mine operation or reallocate for other capital priorities under the Company's capital allocation strategy. Additionally, the CODM primarily uses this metric to assess performance of the segment, plan and forecast future business operations, and benchmark to competitors.\n \nThe financial information relating to the Company’s segments is as follows:\n154\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nSales\nCosts Applicable to Sales\nDepreciation and Amortization\nReclamation and Remediation\nAdvanced Projects, Research and Development and Exploration\nOther Segment Expenses (Income)\n (1)\nIncome (Loss) before Income and Mining Tax and Other Items\nTotal Assets\nCapital Expenditures\n (2)\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nBrucejack\n$\n610\n \n$\n312\n \n$\n172\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n108\n \n$\n2,660\n \n$\n70\n \nRed Chris\nGold\n96\n \n47\n \n14\n \nCopper\n229\n \n172\n \n52\n \nTotal Red Chris\n325\n \n219\n \n66\n \n7\n \n13\n \n(\n2\n)\n22\n \n2,580\n \n150\n \nPeñasquito:\nGold\n713\n \n225\n \n103\n \nSilver\n792\n \n360\n \n159\n \nLead\n195\n \n116\n \n52\n \nZinc\n622\n \n427\n \n162\n \nTotal Peñasquito\n2,322\n \n1,128\n \n476\n \n20\n \n13\n \n43\n \n642\n \n4,879\n \n129\n \nMerian\n660\n \n401\n \n84\n \n4\n \n21\n \n(\n1\n)\n151\n \n943\n \n81\n \nCerro Negro\n566\n \n312\n \n123\n \n5\n \n19\n \n13\n \n94\n \n1,787\n \n186\n \nYanacocha\n841\n \n353\n \n98\n \n55\n \n9\n \n2\n \n324\n \n1,932\n \n61\n \nBoddington:\nGold\n1,417\n \n613\n \n112\n \nCopper\n329\n \n204\n \n39\n \nTotal Boddington\n1,746\n \n817\n \n151\n \n13\n \n4\n \n(\n23\n)\n784\n \n2,420\n \n129\n \nTanami\n988\n \n390\n \n123\n \n2\n \n28\n \n(\n19\n)\n464\n \n2,236\n \n437\n \nCadia:\nGold\n1,118\n \n297\n \n119\n \nCopper\n743\n \n280\n \n123\n \nTotal Cadia\n1,861\n \n577\n \n242\n \n5\n \n19\n \n(\n23\n)\n1,041\n \n6,208\n \n537\n \nLihir\n1,473\n \n787\n \n168\n \n12\n \n16\n \n21\n \n469\n \n5,625\n \n193\n \nAhafo\n1,923\n \n722\n \n215\n \n8\n \n41\n \n(\n38\n)\n975\n \n3,425\n \n382\n \nNGM\n2,485\n \n1,263\n \n428\n \n11\n \n23\n \n32\n \n728\n \n7,430\n \n448\n \nHeld for Sale \n(3)\nCC&V\n347\n \n200\n \n13\n \n11\n \n7\n \n19\n \n97\n \n561\n \n26\n \nMusselwhite\n516\n \n224\n \n18\n \n3\n \n6\n \n—\n \n265\n \n1,102\n \n97\n \nPorcupine\n673\n \n310\n \n36\n \n27\n \n6\n \n633\n \n(\n339\n)\n1,172\n \n201\n \nÉléonore\n583\n \n325\n \n21\n \n4\n \n11\n \n(\n2\n)\n224\n \n855\n \n100\n \nAkyem\n495\n \n338\n \n57\n \n14\n \n5\n \n(\n5\n)\n86\n \n817\n \n24\n \nTotal Reportable Segments\n18,414\n \n8,678\n \n2,491\n \n206\n \n254\n \n650\n \n6,135\n \n46,632\n \n3,251\n \nCorporate and Other\n—\n \n—\n \n68\n \n109\n \n195\n \n967\n \n(\n1,339\n)\n9,717\n \n22\n \nDivested \n(4)\nTelfer:\nGold\n242\n \n245\n \n14\n \nCopper\n26\n \n40\n \n3\n \nTotal Telfer\n268\n \n285\n \n17\n \n13\n \n14\n \n158\n \n(\n219\n)\n—\n \n51\n \nConsolidated\n$\n18,682\n \n$\n8,963\n \n$\n2,576\n \n$\n328\n \n$\n463\n \n$\n1,775\n \n$\n4,577\n \n$\n56,349\n \n$\n3,324\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nOther Segment Expenses (Income) for all reportable segments includes \nImpairment charges\n, \nLoss on assets held for sale\n, \nOther expense, net\n, and \nOther income (loss), net\n.

The impact to \nSales\n from revenue recognized due to the changes in pricing is an increase (decrease) of $\n125\n, $\n37\n, and $(\n34\n) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. \nAt December 31, 2024, Newmont had the following provisionally priced concentrate sales subject to final pricing over the next several months:\nProvisionally Priced Sales\nSubject to Final Pricing\n (1)\nAverage Provisional \nPrice (per ounce/pound)\nGold (ounces, in thousands)\n265\n \n$\n2,635\n \nCopper (pounds, in millions)\n85\n \n$\n3.99\n \nSilver (ounces, in millions)\n6\n \n$\n28.99\n \nLead (pounds, in millions)\n52\n \n$\n0.88\n \nZinc (pounds, in millions)\n114\n \n$\n1.34\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nIncludes provisionally priced by-product sales subject to final pricing, which are recognized in \nCosts applicable to sales.\nSilver Streaming Agreement\nThe Company is obligated to sell \n25\n% of silver production from the Peñasquito mine to Wheaton Precious Metals Corporation at the lesser of market price or a fixed contract price, subject to an annual inflation adjustment of up to \n1.65\n%. This agreement contains off-market terms and was initially recognized at its acquisition date fair value as a finite-lived intangible liability. The current and non-current portion are recorded to \nOther current liabilities\n and \nSilver streaming agreement\n, respectively. The Company’s policy is to amortize the liability into \nSales\n each period using the units-of-production method. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company amortized $\n91\n, $\n42\n, and $\n73\n, respectively, of the liability into revenue. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the value of the liability included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $\n775\n and $\n866\n, respectively.\n161\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nRevenue by Geographic Area\nNewmont primarily conducts metal sales in U.S. dollars, and therefore \nSales\n are not exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies. \nRevenues from sales attributed to countries based on the location of the customer were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnited Kingdom\n (1)\n$\n10,966\n \n$\n7,637\n \n$\n7,537\n \nSouth Korea\n1,956\n \n975\n \n1,426\n \nJapan\n1,920\n \n512\n \n442\n \nPhilippines\n709\n \n451\n \n340\n \nSwitzerland\n638\n \n600\n \n721\n \nMexico\n600\n \n240\n \n604\n \nAustralia\n409\n \n376\n \n7\n \nUnited States\n2\n \n48\n \n24\n \nOther\n1,482\n \n973\n \n814\n \n$\n18,682\n \n$\n11,812\n \n$\n11,915\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nIncludes $\n91\n, $\n42\n, and $\n73\n related to non-cash amortization of the silver streaming agreement liability for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nRevenue by Major Customer\nAs gold can be sold through numerous gold market traders worldwide, the Company is not economically dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of its product. The Company sells copper, silver, lead, and zinc predominantly in the form of concentrates. The concentrates are sold under a combination of short-term and long-term supply contracts with processing fees based on the demand for these concentrates in the global marketplace.\nCustomers with revenue in excess of 10% of total \nSales\n consisted of the following customers in 2024: Standard Chartered $\n4,833\n (\n26\n%), JPMorgan Chase $\n2,317\n (\n12\n%), and Royal Bank of Canada $\n1,897\n (\n10\n%); in 2023: JPMorgan Chase $\n2,583\n (\n22\n%), Royal Bank of Canada $\n1,765\n (\n15\n%), Standard Chartered $\n1,659\n (\n14\n%), and Toronto Dominion Bank $\n1,630\n (\n14\n%); in 2022: Standard Chartered $\n4,179\n (\n35\n%) and JPMorgan Chase $\n1,503\n (\n13\n%).\n \nNOTE 6     \nRECLAMATION AND REMEDIATION\nThe Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations to protect public health and the environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects t\no make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future\n expenditures. Estimated future reclamation and remediation costs are based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements.\nThe Company’s \nReclamation and remediation\n expense consisted of:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nReclamation adjustments and other\n$\n(\n108\n)\n$\n1,207\n \n$\n646\n \nReclamation accretion\n365\n \n238\n \n173\n \nReclamation expense\n257\n \n1,445\n \n819\n \nRemediation adjustments and other\n64\n \n81\n \n96\n \nRemediation accretion\n7\n \n7\n \n6\n \nRemediation expense\n71\n \n88\n \n102\n \nReclamation and remediation\n$\n328\n \n$\n1,533\n \n$\n921\n \nIn 2024, reclamation adjustments were primarily due to a $\n136\n decrease at portions of the Yanacocha site that are no longer in production and with no expected substantive economic value (i.e., non-operating) as a result of updated cost estimates. In 2023, reclamation adjustments were primarily due to increased water management costs at non-operating portions of the Yanacocha site, which resulted in an increase of $\n1,101\n. In 2022, reclamation adjustments were primarily due to higher estimated closure costs resulting from cost inflation and increased water management costs at portions of the Yanacocha and Porcupine site operations that are non-operating that resulted in increases of $\n529\n and $\n91\n, respectively.\n162\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nIn 2024, remediation adjustments were primarily due to the completion of haul road safety enhancements, continued clean up of contaminated materials, and closure of the three mine portals at the Ross Adams mine. In 2023 remediation adjustments were primarily due to higher water management costs and project execution delays at the Midnite mine and Dawn mill sites. In 2022, remediation adjustments are primarily due to higher waste disposal costs and project execution delays at the Midnite mine and Dawn mill sites.\nThe following are reconciliations of \nReclamation and remediation\n \nliabilities\n:\nReclamation\nRemediation\nTotal\nBalance at January 1, 2023\n$\n6,731\n \n$\n373\n \n$\n7,104\n \nAdditions, changes in estimates and other\n1,246\n \n65\n \n1,311\n \nAdditions from the Newcrest transaction\n401\n \n—\n \n401\n \nPayments, net\n(\n231\n)\n(\n44\n)\n(\n275\n)\nAccretion expense\n238\n \n7\n \n245\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n8,385\n \n401\n \n8,786\n \nAdditions, changes in estimates and other\n41\n \n44\n \n85\n \nAcquisitions and divestitures \n(4)\n71\n \n—\n \n71\n \nPayments, net\n(\n351\n)\n(\n82\n)\n(\n433\n)\nAccretion expense\n365\n \n7\n \n372\n \nReclassification to \nLiabilities held for sale\n(\n1,496\n)\n—\n \n(\n1,496\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n7,015\n \n$\n370\n \n$\n7,385\n \nAt December 31,\n2024\n2023\nReclamation\nRemediation\nTotal\nReclamation\nRemediation\nTotal\nCurrent\n (1)\n$\n928\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n991\n \n$\n558\n \n$\n61\n \n$\n619\n \nNon-current\n (2)\n6,087\n \n307\n \n6,394\n \n7,827\n \n340\n \n8,167\n \nTotal\n (3)\n$\n7,015\n \n$\n370\n \n$\n7,385\n \n$\n8,385\n \n$\n401\n \n$\n8,786\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nThe current portion of \nreclamation and remediation liabilities\n are included in \nOther current liabilities\n. Refer to Note 22.\n(2)\nThe non-current portion of reclamation and remediation liabilities are included in \nReclamation and remediation liabilities.\n(3)\nTotal reclamation liabilities includes $\n4,546\n and $\n4,804\n related to Yanacocha at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(4)\nDuring 2024, measurement period adjustments of $\n349\n increased \nReclamation and remediation liabilities\n from refinements to the preliminary valuation of the Newcrest sites. These adjustments were partially offset by $\n278\n as a result of the sale of the assets of the Telfer reportable segment in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe Company is also involved in several matters concerning environmental remediation obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as \n51\n% greater or \n5\n% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2024. The amounts accrued are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are included in \nOther current liabilities\n and \nReclamation and remediation liabilities\n in the period estimates are revised.\nIncluded in \nAssets held for sale\n at December 31, 2024 is $\n93\n of restricted cash held for purposes of settling reclamation and remediation obligations at Akyem.\nIncluded in \nOther non-current assets\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are $\n29\n and $\n81\n respectively, of non-current restricted cash held for purposes of settling reclamation and remediation obligations. The amounts at December 31, 2024 primarily relate to Ahafo and San Jose Reservoir at Yanacocha. The amounts at December 31, 2023 primarily relate to the Ahafo and Akyem mines in Ghana, Africa.\nIncluded in \nOther non-current assets\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n15\n and $\n21\n, respectively, of non-current restricted investments, which are legally pledged for purposes of settling reclamation and remediation obligations. The amounts at December 31, 2024 and 2023 primarily relate to the San Jose Reservoir at Yanacocha.\nRefer to Note 25 for further discussion of reclamation and remediation matters.\n163\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nNOTE 7     \nIMPAIRMENT CHARGES\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nLong-lived and other assets\n (1)\nTotal\nLong-lived and other assets\n (1)\nGoodwill\nTotal\nLong-lived and other assets\n (1)\nGoodwill\nTotal\nNGM\n (2)\n$\n25\n \n$\n25\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \nPeñasquito\n19\n \n19\n \n21\n \n1,210\n \n1,231\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \nCerro Negro\n2\n \n2\n \n5\n \n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \n459\n \n459\n \nCC&V\n (3)\n1\n \n1\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \n511\n \n—\n \n511\n \nMusselwhite\n (3)\n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n293\n \n297\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nÉléonore\n (3)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n246\n \n246\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPorcupine\n (3)\n—\n \n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \n341\n \n341\n \nOther\n31\n \n31\n \n17\n \n—\n \n17\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \nImpairment charges\n$\n78\n \n$\n78\n \n$\n131\n \n$\n1,760\n \n$\n1,891\n \n$\n520\n \n$\n800\n \n$\n1,320\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nPrimarily\n \nrelates to non-cash write-downs of materials and supplies inventory and various assets that are no longer in use, except for certain impairment charges recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022 as described below. \n(2)\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized its proportionate share of the non-cash impairment charge on long-lived assets at NGM. The impairment charge resulted in a remaining balance of $\n2\n and $\n22\n within \nProperty, plant and mine development, net \nat December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining balances were estimated based on observable market values for comparable assets for the individual assets that were determined to have residual market value.\n(3)\nSites are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 3 for further information.\nThe estimated cash flows utilized in both the long-lived asset and goodwill impairment evaluations are derived from the Company's current business plans. The Company completed its annual business plan update which reflected updated mine plans, certain adverse changes in market conditions, including inflationary pressures to costs and capital, strategic evaluation regarding the use of capital, and updates to asset retirement costs.\nImpairment of goodwill\nThe Company evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually at December 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Each operating mine is considered a distinct reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. Based on the December 31, 2024 review, the Company concluded that \nGoodwill\n was not impaired at any of the reporting units.\nBased on the December 31, 2023 review, the Company concluded that \nGoodwill\n was impaired at the Musselwhite, Éléonore and Peñasquito reporting units. The goodwill impairments at Musselwhite and Éléonore were driven by a deterioration in underlying cash flows from higher costs due to inflationary pressures, and resulted in non-cash impairment charges of $\n293\n and $\n246\n, respectively, which represented the full goodwill balance of the reporting units prior to impairment. The goodwill impairment at Peñasquito was also driven by lower expected cash flows, primarily due to an update to the geological model that impacted expected metal grade and recoveries, as well as higher costs due to inflationary pressures, and resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $\n1,210\n, which represented the full goodwill balance of the reporting unit prior to impairment. The long-lived assets of Musselwhite, Éléonore and Peñasquito were evaluated for impairment prior to the quantitative goodwill assessment and no impairment was identified. \nIn addition, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n11\n at NGM as a result of the decision to not pursue permitting for Phase 2 mining at Long Canyon. As a result, NGM placed Long Canyon on long-term care and maintenance and revised their business plan. The impairment represented the full goodwill balance at Long Canyon based on the Company's proportionate interest in NGM. \nThe Company measured the impairments by comparing the total fair value of the operations to the corresponding reporting unit carrying value. The estimated fair value was determined using the income approach and is considered a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs to the fair value measured included (i) updated cash flow information from the Company's current business and closure plans, (ii) a short-term gold price of $\n1,950\n, (iii) a long-term gold price of $\n1,700\n, (iv) current estimates of reserves, resources, and exploration potential, and (v) a reporting unit specific discount rate of \n10.00\n% at Musselwhite, \n17.50\n% at Éléonore, and \n6.75\n% at Peñasquito. The selected discount rates for Musselwhite and Éléonore incorporate additional premium related to operational risk at these sites.\nBased on the December 31, 2022 review, the Company concluded that \nGoodwill\n was impaired at the Porcupine and the Cerro Negro reporting units. The Porcupine goodwill impairment was driven by a deterioration in underlying cash flows from higher costs due to inflationary pressures and higher capital costs related to safety enhancements and the expansion of the active tailings storage \n164\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nfacility, ensuring GISTM compliance, as well as an increase to the asset retirement cost, and resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $\n341\n, which represented the full goodwill balance of the reporting unit prior to impairment. The Cerro Negro goodwill impairment was driven by a \n14\n% country specific discount rate that reflects current macroeconomic risk and uncertainty in Argentina, and resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $\n459\n, which represented the full goodwill balance of the reporting unit prior to impairment. The long-lived assets of Porcupine and Cerro Negro were evaluated for impairment prior to the quantitative goodwill test and no impairment was identified.\nThe Company measured the impairments by comparing the total fair value of the existing operations to the corresponding reporting unit carrying value. The estimated fair value was determined using the income approach and is considered a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs to the fair value measured included (i) updated cash flow information from the Company's current business and closure plans, (ii) a short-term gold price of $\n1,750\n, (iii) a long-term gold price of $\n1,600\n, (iv) current estimates of reserves, resources, and exploration potential, and (v) a country specific discount rate of \n4.50\n% in Canada and \n14\n% in Argentina.\nImpairment of long-lived and other assets\nThe Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company determined that an impairment indicator existed at CC&V. This determination was based on the updated business plan, which reflected a deterioration in underlying cash flows from lower production, impacted by the decision to place the mill on long-term care and maintenance, higher costs due to inflationary pressures, as well as an increase to the asset retirement cost. As a result of the impairment indicator, a recoverability test was performed and the Company concluded the long-lived assets at CC&V were impaired resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $\n511\n and a remaining balance of $\n25\n within \nProperty, plant and mine development, net\n at December 31, 2022. The Company measured the impairment by comparing the total fair value of the existing operations to the carrying value of the corresponding assets. The estimated fair value was determined using the income approach and is considered a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs to the fair value measurement included (i) updated cash flow information from the Company's current business and closure plans, (ii) a short-term gold price of $\n1,750\n, (iii) a long-term gold price of $\n1,600\n, (iv) current estimates of reserves, resources, and exploration potential, and (v) a country specific pre-tax discount rate of \n6.75\n%.\nNOTE 8     \nOTHER EXPENSE, NET\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNewcrest transaction and integration costs\n (1)\n$\n72\n \n$\n464\n \n$\n—\n \nSettlement costs\n (2)\n44\n \n7\n \n22\n \nRestructuring and severance\n (3)\n38\n \n24\n \n4\n \nCOVID-19 specific costs\n (4)\n—\n \n1\n \n38\n \nOther\n37\n \n21\n \n18\n \nOther expense, net\n$\n191\n \n$\n517\n \n$\n82\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nRelated to the Newcrest transaction; refer to Note 3 for further information.

These deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other metals produced by the Company.\nThe Company operates in various jurisdictions around the world that have statutory tax rates that are significantly different than those of the U.S. These differences combine to move the overall effective tax rate higher than the U.S. statutory rate. \nMining taxes in Nevada, Mexico, Canada, Peru, and Australia represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits.\nIn the U.S., capital losses may be carried forward five years to offset capital gains. Capital loss carryforwards of $\n222\n, $\n—\n, and $\n—\n, expired in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as the Company's projections for future growth. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present or if additional weight were given to subjective evidence such as the Company's projections for growth.\nDuring 2024, the Company recorded a decrease to the valuation allowance of $\n302\n and a corresponding tax benefit, primarily driven by decreases in the net deferred tax asset in Argentina, the valuation allowance on Canada's tax credits and property, plant and mine development, and the release associated with the expiration of capital loss carryforwards. There were additional valuation allowance established as a result of purchase accounting for the Newcrest transaction of $\n168\n.\nRefer to Note 2 for additional risk factors that could impact the Company’s ability to realize the deferred tax assets.\nTax Loss Carryforwards, Foreign Tax Credits, and Canadian Tax Credits\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had (i) $\n2,005\n and $\n3,678\n of net operating loss carry forwards, respectively; and (ii) $\n414\n and $\n513\n of tax credit carry forwards, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $\n760\n and $\n989\n, respectively, of net operating loss carry forwards are attributable to the U.S., Australia, and France for which current tax law provides no expiration period. The net operating loss carry forward in Canada of $\n772\n will expire by 2043. The net operating loss carryforward in Mexico of $\n173\n will expire by 2033. The net operating loss carry forward in other countries is $\n300\n. \nTax credit carry forwards for 2024 and 2023 of $\n414\n and $\n284\n, respectively, consist of foreign tax credits available in the United States; substantially all such credits not utilized will expire at the end of 2029, and of solar tax credit for 2024 and 2023 of $\n27\n and $\n19\n, respectively, which will expire by 2046. Canadian tax credits for 2024 and 2023 of $\n77\n and $\n210\n, respectively, consist of investment tax credits and minimum mining tax credits. Canadian investment tax credits for 2024 consisted of $\n72\n which will substantially expire by 2043, and mining tax credits of $\n5\n which will expire by 2042.\n168\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nCompany’s Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, is as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year\n$\n144\n \n$\n190\n \n$\n245\n \nAdditions (reductions) for tax positions of prior years \n(\n8\n)\n13\n \n(\n1\n)\nAdditions for tax positions of current year \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \nReductions due to settlements with taxing authorities \n(\n2\n)\n(\n18\n)\n(\n53\n)\nReductions due to lapse of statute of limitations \n(\n23\n)\n(\n43\n)\n(\n1\n)\nTotal amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits at end of year\n$\n111\n \n$\n144\n \n$\n190\n \nAt December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, $\n125\n, $\n190\n, and $\n219\n, respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties that, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective income tax rate.\nThe Company operates in numerous countries around the world and is subject to, and pays annual income taxes under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company’s business conducted within the country involved.\nThrough the due diligence and integration processes, the Company has not identified new uncertain tax positions as a result of the Newcrest transaction. \nThe Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) is conducting a limited review of the Company’s prior year tax returns. The ATO is reviewing an internal reorganization executed in 2011 when Newmont completed a restructure of the shareholding in the Company’s Australian subsidiaries. To date, the Company has responded to inquiries from the ATO and provided them with supporting documentation for the transaction and the Company’s associated tax positions. One aspect of the ATO review relates to an Australian capital gains tax that applies to sales or transfers of stock in certain types of entities. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the ATO notified the Company that it believes the 2011 reorganization is subject to capital gains tax of approximately $\n85\n (including interest and penalties). The Company disputes this conclusion and is vigorously defending its position that the transaction is not subject to this tax. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made a $\n24\n payment to the ATO and lodged an Appeal with the Australian Federal Court. The court proceedings were held during the third quarter of 2024 and the Company is currently awaiting the judgment, which is expected during the second quarter of 2025.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (\"AFIP\") in Argentina notified the Company that it completed the 2016 transfer pricing review. The AFIP has questioned the Company’s treatment of intercompany loans and believes they should be akin to capital contributions. In the fourth quarter of 2024, while the Company still believes in the merits of the position, it has opted into Argentina's newly implemented Tax Amnesty Program and made a settlement payment of $\n8\n in 2024 with the remaining $\n26\n to be paid in early 2025. The Tax Amnesty Program reduces the tax penalties and alleviates potential criminal charges.\nThe Company and/or subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016. As a result of (i) statute of limitations that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions, and (ii) possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its unrecognized income tax liability will decrease between $\n10\n and $\n30\n in the next 12 months.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of \nIncome and mining tax benefit (expense)\n. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $\n47\n and $\n78\n, respectively.

The Company’s non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. The information contained in the above tables presents the combined funded status of qualified and non-qualified plans. The Company reviews its retirement benefit programs on a regular basis and will consider market conditions and the funded status of its qualified pension plans in determining whether additional contributions are appropriate in calendar year 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all pension benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of assets with the exception of one defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. and one defined benefit pension plan in Canada. The fair value of the plan assets associated with these pension benefit plans was in excess of the related accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations. \nThe following table provides information for the Company's defined benefit pensions plans that had aggregate accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31:\nPension Benefits\n (1)\n2024\n2023\nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n39\n \n$\n42\n \nAccumulated benefit obligation\n$\n32\n \n$\n35\n \nFair value of plan assets\n$\n2\n \n$\n1\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nInformation for other benefit plans with an accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets has not been included as all of the other benefit plans are unfunded.\nThe significant assumptions used in measuring the Company’s benefit obligation were mortality assumptions and discount rate.\nThe mortality assumptions used to measure the pension and other post retirement obligation incorporate future mortality improvements from tables published by the Society of Actuaries (\"SOA\"). In 2024 and 2023, the SOA announced they would not release a new generational projection scale for the related years and instead updated the Mortality Improvement Model (\"MIM\") tool with the ability to optionally input mortality loads to model differing viewpoints of the ongoing effect of COVID. The Company utilized the Pri-2012 mortality tables and the MP-2021 generational projection scales, with no adjustment for COVID due to the Company not experiencing material mortality gain due to COVID, to measure the pension and other post retirement obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nYield curves matching the Company’s benefit obligations were derived using a model based on high quality corporate bond data from Bloomberg. The model develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose projected cash flows match the projected benefit payments of the plan. The resulting curves were used to identify a weighted average discount rate for the Company of \n5.77\n% and \n5.33\n% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, based on the timing of future benefit payments.\nActuarial (gain) loss of $(\n24\n) and $\n21\n was recognized in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to a change in discount rate from the prior year. \nSettlement accounting is required when annual lump sum payments exceed the annual interest and service costs for a plan and results in a remeasurement of the related pension benefit obligation and plan assets and the recognition of settlement charges in \nOther income (loss), net\n due to the acceleration of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses. Lump sum payments are primarily made from the plan assets. Settlement accounting was triggered for the periods ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 resulting in pension settlement charges of $\n1\n, $\n9\n and $\n137\n, respectively. \nFor the period ended December 31, 2022, pension settlement charges primarily resulted from the Company executing an annuitization to transfer a portion of the pension plan obligations from the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans to an insurance company using plan assets during the first quarter of 2022. As a result, $\n527\n of the previously recognized pension obligations were transferred and settlement accounting was triggered which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash settlement loss of $\n130\n in \nOther income (loss), net. \nIn December 2022, the Company received the final true-up from the insurance company for the annuitization, which had an inconsequential impact on the settlement.\n171\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nThe following table provides the net pension and other benefits amounts recognized in\n Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n:\nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\nAt December 31,\nAt December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss):\nNet actuarial gain (loss)\n$\n(\n71\n)\n$\n(\n76\n)\n$\n33\n \n$\n24\n \nPrior service credit\n2\n \n4\n \n—\n \n1\n \n(\n69\n)\n(\n72\n)\n33\n \n25\n \nLess: Income taxes\n15\n \n16\n \n(\n7\n)\n(\n5\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n54\n)\n$\n(\n56\n)\n$\n26\n \n$\n20\n \nThe following table provides components of the total benefit cost (income), inclusive of the net periodic pension and other benefits costs (credits):\nPension Benefit Costs (Credits)\nOther Benefit Costs (Credits)\nYears Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPension benefit cost (income), net:\n (1)\nService cost \n$\n14\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \nInterest cost \n17\n \n17\n \n19\n \n4\n \n4\n \n3\n \nExpected return on plan assets \n(\n24\n)\n(\n23\n)\n(\n35\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAmortization, net\n1\n \n(\n7\n)\n2\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n3\n)\nNet periodic benefit cost (income)\n8\n \n(\n1\n)\n1\n \n3\n \n3\n \n1\n \nSettlement cost\n1\n \n9\n \n137\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal benefit cost (income)\n$\n9\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n138\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n1\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nService costs are included in \nCosts applicable to sales\n or \nGeneral and administrative\n and the other components of benefit costs are included in \nOther income (loss)\n,\n net\n.\n \nThe following table provides the components recognized in \nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n:\nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet loss (gain)\n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n8\n \n$\n(\n20\n)\n$\n(\n10\n)\n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n20\n)\nAmortization, net\n(\n1\n)\n7\n \n(\n2\n)\n2\n \n2\n \n3\n \nPrior service cost\n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nSettlements\n(\n1\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n137\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal recognized in other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n8\n \n$\n(\n159\n)\n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n5\n \n$\n(\n17\n)\nTotal benefit cost (credit) and other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n6\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n(\n21\n)\n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n8\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\nActuarial losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining future service period of the current active participants.\n172\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nThe significant assumptions used in measuring the Company’s Total benefit cost (income) and \nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n were discount rate and expected return on plan assets:\nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted average assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost:\nDiscount rate \n(1)\n5.33\n \n%\n5.63\n \n%\n4.09\n \n%\n6.09\n \n%\n6.10\n \n%\n3.03\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets \n7.09\n \n%\n6.38\n \n%\n6.75\n \n%\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n____________________________\n(1)\nTotal benefit cost (income) and other comprehensive income (loss) for the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was remeasured due to the settlement accounting required from the retiree annuity purchase on March 25, 2022. The discount rate used for determining the Total benefit cost (income) and other comprehensive income (loss) reflected \n3.03\n% from January 1, 2022 through March 25, 2022 and \n4.09\n% from March 26, 2022 through December 31, 2022.\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets used for each period in the three years ended December 31, 2024 was determined based on an analysis of the asset returns over multiple time horizons for the Company’s actual plan and for other comparable U.S. corporations. At December 31, 2024, Newmont has estimated the expected long-term return on the qualified pension plan's assets to be \n7.20\n% which will be used in determining future net periodic benefit cost. The Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by considering the most recent capital market forecasts, the plans’ current asset allocation and the actual return on plan assets in comparison to the expected return on assets. The average actual return on the qualified pension plan's assets during the \n36\n years ended December 31, 2024 approximated \n7.52\n%.\nNewmont has \ntwo\n pension calculations for salaried U.S. employees. The first is a “Final Average Pay” pension calculation which is defined as a monthly annuity at age 62 based, in part, on their highest \nfive year\n eligible earnings and years of credited service. The second is the “Stable Value” calculation which is defined as a lump sum payment to employees upon retirement. The amount of the lump sum is the total of annual accruals based on the employee’s eligible earnings and years of service. The benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula were frozen on June 30, 2014 for those eligible employees. Beginning July 1, 2014, all future accruals are based on the terms and features of the Stable Value calculation.\nThe assumed health care trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits is \n6.50\n% in 2025 and decreases gradually each year to \n5.00\n% in 2031, which is used thereafter.\nThe qualified pension plan employs an independent investment firm which invests the assets of the plans in certain approved funds that correspond to specific asset classes with associated target allocations. The goal of the pension fund investment program is to achieve prudent actuarial funding ratios while maintaining acceptable risk levels. The investment performance of the plans and that of the individual investment firms is measured against recognized market indices. The performance of the pension funds are monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the Company’s management, which is advised by an independent investment consultant. With the exception of global capital market economic risks, the Company has identified no significant portfolio risks associated to asset classes. \nThe following is a summary of the target asset allocations for 2024 and the actual asset allocation at December 31, 2024:\nAsset Allocation\nTarget\nActual at December 31, 2024\nFixed income investments\n45\n \n%\n44\n \n%\nWorld equity fund (U.S. and International equity investments)\n20\n \n%\n20\n \n%\nInternational equity investments\n12\n \n%\n12\n \n%\nU.S. equity investments \n11\n \n%\n11\n \n%\nReal estate\n8\n \n%\n9\n \n%\nHigh yield fixed income investments\n4\n \n%\n4\n \n%\nCash equivalents\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nCash equivalent instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and are primarily invested in money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities. \nCommingled fund investments are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the net asset value per share for each fund. Although the majority of the underlying assets in the funds consist of actively traded equity securities and bonds, the unit of account is considered to be at the fund level. These funds require less than a month’s notice for redemptions and can be redeemed at the net asset value per share.\n173\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s pension plan assets measured at fair value:\nFair Value at December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCommingled Funds:\nFixed income investments\n$\n143\n \n$\n152\n \nWorld equity fund (U.S. and International equity investments)\n54\n \n54\n \nInternational equity investments\n45\n \n45\n \nU.S. equity investments\n34\n \n34\n \nReal estate\n25\n \n25\n \nHigh yield fixed income investments\n11\n \n11\n \n312\n \n321\n \nCash equivalents\n1\n \n1\n \nTotal\n$\n313\n \n$\n322\n \nCash Flows\nBenefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as follows:\nPension Plan\nOther Benefits Plan\n2025\n$\n21\n \n$\n6\n \n2026\n$\n21\n \n$\n6\n \n2027\n$\n21\n \n$\n5\n \n2028\n$\n24\n \n$\n5\n \n2029\n$\n24\n \n$\n5\n \nThereafter\n$\n131\n \n$\n26\n \nSavings Plans\nThe Company has \none\n qualified defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. that covers salaried and hourly employees. When an employee meets eligibility requirements, the Company matches \n100\n% of employee contributions of up to \n6\n% of eligible earnings. Hourly employees receive an additional retirement contribution to the participant’s retirement contribution account equal to an amount which is paid and determined by the Company. Currently, the additional retirement contribution is \n5\n% of eligible earnings. Matching contributions are made in cash. In addition, the Company has \none\n non-qualified supplemental savings plan for executive-level employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal regulations.\n \nNOTE 12     \nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company has stock incentive plans for directors, executives and eligible employees. Stock incentive awards include RSUs and PSUs. The Company issues new shares of common stock to satisfy vesting under all of its stock incentive awards. Prior to 2012, the Company also granted options to purchase shares of stock with exercise prices not less than fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. At December 31, 2024, \n18,993,357\n shares were authorized for future stock incentive plan awards.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company grants RSUs to directors, executives and eligible employees. Awards are determined as a target percentage of base salary and, for eligible employees, are subject to a personal performance factor. For all RSU grants issued prior to February 2018, RSU awards vest on a straight-line basis over periods of \nthree years\n or more, unless the employee becomes retirement eligible prior to the vesting date. If an employee becomes retirement eligible and retires prior to the vesting date, the remaining awards vest on a pro rata basis at the retirement date. Starting with the February 2018 grant, if the employee becomes retirement eligible at any point during the vesting period, the entire award is considered earned after the later of the \none-year\n service period from the grant date or the retirement eligible date. Prior to vesting, holders of RSUs do not have the right to vote the underlying shares; however, directors, executives and eligible employees accrue dividend equivalents on their RSUs, which are paid at the time the RSUs vest. The accrued dividend equivalents are not paid if RSUs are forfeited. The RSUs are subject to forfeiture risk and other restrictions. Upon vesting, the employee is entitled to receive \none\n share of the Company’s common stock for each restricted stock unit.\nPerformance Stock Units\nIn 2023 and 2024, the Company amended the PSU plan for eligible executives to incorporate awards that vest based on certain performance-related conditions in addition to the historically granted awards that vest based on certain market-related conditions. \n174\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nFor market-related conditions, the awards vest after the \nthree-year\n requisite service period based on the Company's total stockholder return compared to the return of a peer group. The grant date fair value of the awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the required performance period. \nThe grant date fair value of the market-related conditions for each PSU granted in 2024, 2023 or 2022 was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model, which requires the input of the following subjective assumptions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.40\n%\n4.45\n%\n1.61\n%\nVolatility range\n17.50\n% - \n76.70\n%\n34.24\n% - \n81.36\n%\n31.78\n% - \n81.77\n%\nWeighted-average volatility\n47.71\n%\n55.24\n%\n54.89\n%\nExpected term (years)\n3\n3\n3\nWeighted-average fair market value\n$\n33.91\n$\n50.39\n$\n77.00\nThe risk-free interest rates are based on a U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's stock as well as the stock of the peer group for the \nthree-year\n performance period. \nFor performance-related conditions, the awards vest based on the achievement of certain performance metrics which include (i) representation of women on executive team, (ii) Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions related to key milestone projects, and (iii) return on capital employed. The grant date fair value of the awards are amortized over the \nthree-year\n requisite service period, based on the probability of the performance conditions being met.\nThe grant date fair value of the performance-related conditions for each PSU granted in 2024 was determined using the Company's stock price on the grant. The weighted-average fair market value for 2024 was $\n30.01\n.\nStock-Based Compensation Activity\nA summary of the status and activity of non-vested RSUs and PSUs for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:\nRSU\nPSU\nNumber of Units\nWeighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value\nNumber of Units\nWeighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value\nNon-vested at beginning of year\n2,102,567\n \n$\n48.95\n \n1,193,535\n \n$\n60.60\n \nGranted\n2,509,780\n \n$\n31.20\n \n878,974\n \n$\n28.00\n \nVested\n(\n1,011,308\n)\n$\n50.60\n \n(\n173,982\n)\n$\n65.41\n \nForfeited\n(\n322,569\n)\n$\n35.91\n \n(\n256,814\n)\n$\n48.22\n \nNon-vested at end of year\n3,278,470\n \n$\n36.13\n \n1,641,713\n \n$\n44.58\n \nThe total intrinsic value and fair value of RSUs that vested in 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $\n37\n, $\n36\n, and $\n62\n, respectively.

The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2    Quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\nLevel 3    Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).\nThe following tables set forth the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring (at least annually) and nonrecurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair Value at December 31, 2024\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n (1)\n$\n3,619\n \n$\n3,619\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nRestricted cash\n31\n \n31\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTrade receivables from provisional concentrate sales, net \n993\n \n—\n \n993\n \n—\n \nAssets held for sale (Note 3)\n (2)\n1,840\n \n—\n \n1,168\n \n672\n \nEquity method investments\n212\n \n212\n \n—\n \n—\n \nMarketable and other equity securities (Note 15)\n305\n \n305\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRestricted marketable debt securities (Note 15)\n15\n \n15\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDerivative assets (Note 14)\n142\n \n—\n \n—\n \n142\n \nOther assets\n (3)\n61\n \n—\n \n—\n \n61\n \n$\n7,218\n \n$\n4,182\n \n$\n2,161\n \n$\n875\n \nLiabilities:\nDebt\n (4)\n$\n8,400\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n8,400\n \n$\n—\n \nDerivative liabilities (Note 14)\n143\n \n—\n \n137\n \n6\n \nOther liabilities\n (5)\n51\n \n—\n \n51\n \n—\n \n$\n8,594\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n8,588\n \n$\n6\n \n176\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nFair Value at December 31, 2023\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n (1)\n$\n3,002\n \n$\n3,002\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nRestricted cash\n98\n \n98\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTrade receivables from provisional concentrate sales, net \n734\n \n—\n \n734\n \n—\n \nMarketable and other equity securities (Note 15)\n252\n \n243\n \n9\n \n—\n \nRestricted marketable debt securities (Note 15)\n21\n \n21\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDerivative assets (Note 14)\n642\n \n—\n \n7\n \n635\n \n$\n4,749\n \n$\n3,364\n \n$\n750\n \n$\n635\n \nLiabilities:\nDebt\n (4)\n$\n8,975\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n8,975\n \n$\n—\n \nDerivative liabilities (Note 14)\n8\n \n—\n \n3\n \n5\n \n$\n8,983\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n8,978\n \n$\n5\n \n____________________________\n(1)\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 and 2023 include term deposits that have an original maturity of three months or less.\n(2)\nAssets held for sale at December 31, 2024 includes assets held for sale that were written down to their fair value, excluding costs to sell, of $\n1,840\n at December 31, 2024.

The fixed forward contracts were transacted for risk management purposes. The Company has designated the fixed forward contracts as foreign currency cash flow hedges against the forecasted AUD-denominated Tanami Expansion 2 capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2024, the hedge program matured and a gain of $\n7\n remains in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n.\nThe unrealized changes in fair value have been recorded in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n and are reclassified to income during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the underlying hedge transaction becomes probable of not occurring, the related amounts will be reclassified to earnings immediately. For the foreign currency cash flow hedges related to capital expenditures, amounts recorded in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n are reclassified to earnings through \nDepreciation and amortization\n after the project reaches commercial production.

At acquisition, the fair value of Newmont’s equity investment in Pueblo Viejo was lower than the underlying net assets of its investment resulting in a basis difference, which is being amortized into \nEquity income (loss) of affiliates\n over the remaining estimated useful life of the mine. As of December 31, 2024 the net basis difference was $\n295\n.\nIn September 2019, the Company and Barrick entered into a $\n70\n revolving loan facility (“Revolving Facility”) to provide short-term financing to Pueblo Viejo.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Company and Barrick distributed funds based on their respective proportionate ownership interest in Pueblo Viejo. The Loan Facility bears interest at \n95\n% of the 6-month SOFR plus \n4.25\n% which is compounded semi-annually in arrears on February 28 and August 31 of each year. The Loan Facility was provided in two tranches of $\n800\n and $\n500\n, respectively. Unused proceeds under the first tranche are available for use under the second tranche.

The project is jointly managed by Newmont and Teck Resources Limited, who holds the remaining \n50\n% interest. At acquisition, the carrying value of Newmont’s equity investment in NuevaUnión was lower than the underlying net assets of its investment resulting in a basis difference. This basis difference will be amortized into \nEquity income (loss) of affiliates\n over the remaining estimated useful life of the mine beginning when commercial production is declared, which had not yet occurred as of December 31, 2024. \nAt December 31, 2024 the carrying value of Newmont’s equity investment in NuevaUnión was lower than the underlying net assets of its investment by $\n67\n.

The Company has agreed to fund both its and Barrick's portions of prefeasibility study costs, up to a total of $\n60\n, to occur in the near future. If prefeasibility costs exceed the agreed upon $\n60\n, the costs will be paid proportionately by the Company and Barrick.

Refer below for further information.\n \nCorporate Revolving Credit Facilities and Letters of Credit Facilities\nIn connection with the Newcrest transaction on November 6, 2023, the Company acquired bilateral bank debt facilities held with \n13\n banks. The bilateral bank debt facilities had a total borrowing capacity of $\n2,000\n, of which $\n1,923\n was outstanding at December 31, 2023, and $\n462\n due February 7, 2024, $\n769\n due March 1, 2024, and $\n692\n due March 1, 2026. On February 7, 2024, the Company repaid $\n462\n of the amount outstanding.\nOn February 15, 2024, the Company completed an amendment and restatement of its existing $\n3,000\n revolving credit agreement dated as of April 4, 2019 (the “Existing Credit Agreement”). The Existing Credit Agreement was entered into with a syndicate of financial institutions and provided for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contained a letter of credit sub-facility. Per the amendment, the expiration date of the credit facility was extended from March 30, 2026 to February 15, 2029 and the borrowing capacity was increased to $\n4,000\n. Interest is based on Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment and margin. Facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized, non-current debt. Debt covenants under the amendment are substantially the same as the Existing Credit Agreement.\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company completed a drawdown on the $\n4,000\n revolving credit agreement and used the proceeds to repay the remaining $\n1,461\n owed on the remaining bilateral bank debt facilities.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had \nno\n borrowings outstanding under the facility. There were \nno\n amounts outstanding on the letters of credit sub-facility at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company had letters of credit outstanding in the amounts of $\n1,034\n and $\n1,158\n, respectively, of which $\n900\n and $\n1,015\n represented guarantees for reclamation obligations, respectively. None of these letters of credit have been drawn on for reclamation obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n187\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nDebt Extinguishment\nIn 2024, the Company partially redeemed certain Senior Notes resulting in a gain on extinguishment of $\n38\n recognized in \nOther income (loss), net\n for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Net proceeds from the 2026 and 2034 Senior Notes were $\n1,980\n. Interest will be paid semi-annually at a rate of \n5.30\n% and \n5.35\n% per annum for the 2026 and the 2034 Senior Notes, respectively. The proceeds from this issuance were used to repay the drawdown on the revolving credit facility resulting in no amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2024.\nIn February 2025, the Company fully redeemed all of the outstanding 2026 Senior Notes for a redemption price of $\n957\n. The redemption price equaled the principal amount of the outstanding 2026 Senior Notes of $\n928\n plus accrued and unpaid interest of $\n19\n in accordance with the terms of the 2026 Notes, and a make-whole provision of $\n10\n.\nMay 2030 Senior Notes, November 2041 Senior Notes, and May 2050 Senior Notes\nSubsequent to implementation of the Newcrest transaction, the Company completed a like-for-like exchange for any and all of the outstanding notes issued by Newcrest Finance Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont (\"Newcrest Finance\"), with an aggregate principal amount of $\n1,650\n, for new notes issued by Newmont and Newcrest Finance and nominal cash consideration. The new notes, issued December 26, 2023, and the existing Newcrest notes that were not tendered for exchange, consist of $\n625\n and $\n25\n of \n3.25\n% notes due May 13, 2030 (the \"May 2030 Senior Notes\" and the \"2030 Newcrest Senior Notes\", respectively), $\n460\n and $\n40\n of \n5.75\n% notes due November 15, 2041 (the \"November 2041 Senior Notes\" and the \"2041 Newcrest Senior Notes\", respectively), and $\n486\n and $\n14\n of \n4.20\n% notes due May 13, 2050, respectively (the \"May 2050 Senior Notes\" and the \"2050 Newcrest Senior Notes\", respectively).\nDebt Covenants\nThe Company’s senior notes and revolving credit facility contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, leases, sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. Furthermore, the Company’s senior notes and corporate revolving credit facility contain covenants that include, limiting the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets.\nThe corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to \n62.50\n% in addition to the covenants noted above.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all existing debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults, other than the bilateral facilities which have been repaid as of the date of this report.\nNOTE 21     \nLEASE AND OTHER FINANCING OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company primarily has operating and finance leases for corporate and regional offices, mining equipment, power generation, and transportation.

If a loss contingency is not probable or \n191\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nreasonably estimable, disclosure of the contingency and estimated range of loss, if determinable, is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred.\nOperating Segments\nThe Company’s operating and reportable segments are identified in Note 4. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the Company’s commitments and contingencies specifically described herein are included in the non-operating segment Corporate and Other. The Yanacocha matters relate to the Yanacocha reportable segment. The CC&V matter relates to the CC&V reportable segment. The Goldcorp Canada matters relates to the Porcupine reportable segment. The Cadia matter relates to the Cadia reportable segment. The Newmont Ghana Gold and Newmont Golden Ridge matters relate to the Ahafo and Akyem reportable segments, respectively.\nEnvironmental Matters\nRefer to Note 6 for further information regarding reclamation and remediation. Details about certain significant matters are discussed below.\nMinera Yanacocha S.R.L. - \n100\n% Newmont Owned\nIn early 2015 and again in June 2017, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, MINAM, issued proposed modifications to water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria modified the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In December 2015, MINAM issued the final regulation that modified the water quality standards. These Peruvian regulations allow time to formulate a compliance plan and make any necessary changes to achieve compliance.\nIn February 2017, Yanacocha submitted a modification to its previously approved compliance achievement plan to the MINEM. In May 2022, Yanacocha submitted a proposed modification to this plan requesting an extension of time for coming into full compliance with the new regulations to 2027. In June 2023, Yanacocha received approval of its updated compliance plan from MINEM and was granted an extension to June 2026 to achieve compliance. The Company appealed this approval to the Mining Council requesting the regulatory extension until 2027, and in April 2024, MINEM approved the compliance schedule.\nThe Company currently operates \nfive\n water treatment plants at Yanacocha that have been and currently meet all currently applicable water discharge requirements. The Company is conducting detailed studies to better estimate water management and other closure activities that will ensure water quality and quantity discharge requirements, including the modifications promulgated by MINAM, as referenced above, will be met. This also includes performing a comprehensive update to the Yanacocha reclamation plan to address changes in closure activities and estimated closure costs while preserving optionality for potential future projects at Yanacocha. These ongoing studies, which will extend beyond the current year, continue to evaluate and revise assumptions and estimated costs of changes to the reclamation plan. While certain estimated costs remain subject to revision, the Company’s current asset retirement obligation includes plans for the construction and post-closure management of \ntwo\n new water treatment plants and initial consideration of known risks (including the associated risk that these water treatment estimates could change in the future as more work is completed). The ultimate construction costs of the \ntwo\n water treatment plants remain uncertain as ongoing study work and assessment of opportunities that incorporates the latest design considerations remain in progress. These and other additional risks and contingencies that are the subject of ongoing studies, including, but not limited to, a comprehensive review of the Company's tailings storage facility management, review of Yanacocha’s water balance and storm water management system, and review of post-closure management costs, could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at Yanacocha.\nCripple Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company LLC - \n100\n% Newmont Owned\nIn December 2021, Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company LLC (“CC&V”, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) entered into a Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) with the Water Quality Control Division of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (the “Division”) with a mutual objective of resolving issues associated with the new discharge permits issued by the Division in January 2021 for the Carlton Tunnel. The Carlton Tunnel was a historic tunnel completed in 1941 with the purpose of draining the southern portion of the mining district, subsequently consolidated by CC&V. CC&V has held discharge permits for the Carlton Tunnel since 1983, primarily to focus on monitoring, with the monitoring data accumulated since the mid-1970s indicating consistency in the water quality discharged from the Carlton Tunnel over time. In 2006, legal proceedings and work with the regulator confirmed that the water flowing out of the Carlton Tunnel portal is akin to natural spring water and did not constitute mine drainage. However, this changed with the January 2021 permit updates, when the regulator imposed new water quality limits. The Settlement Agreement involves the evaluation of a reasonable and achievable timeline for treatment and permit compliance, acknowledging the lack of readily available technology, and the need to spend three years to study and select the technological solution, with three additional years to construct, bringing full permit compliance to the November 2027 timeframe. In 2022, the Company studied various interim passive water treatment options, reported the study results to the Division, and based on an evaluation of additional semi-passive options that involve the usage of power at the portal, updated the remediation liability to $\n20\n in 2022. CC&V continues to study alternative long-term remediation plans for water discharged from the Carlton Tunnel, and is also working with regulators on the Discharger Specific Variance (\"DSV\") to identify highest feasible alternative treatment in the context, based on limits such as area topography. CC&V formally submitted its proposal for the DSV and the matter will be presented to the \n192\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nWater Quality Control Commission for June 2025 rulemaking hearing. Depending on the outcome of the hearing and the plans that may ultimately be agreed with the Division, a material adjustment to the remediation liability may be required.\nIn July 2024, CC&V received a notice from the Colorado Division of Reclamation Mining and Safety (\"DRMS\") citing it has reason to believe a violation existed with respect to reporting of monitoring data for mine impacted water at the mine’s East Cresson Overburden Storage Area (\"ECOSA\"). The Company and the DRMS reached a favorable Stipulated Agreement, which was submitted to the Mined Land Reclamation Board during the fourth quarter of 2024 and incorporated into an order of the Board.\nDawn Mining Company LLC (“Dawn”) - \n58.19\n% Newmont Owned\nMidnite mine site and Dawn mill site\n. Dawn previously leased an open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management), as well as the EPA.\nAs per the Consent Decree approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington on January 17, 2012, the following actions were required of Newmont, Dawn, the Department of the Interior and the EPA: (i) Newmont and Dawn would design, construct and implement the cleanup plan selected by the EPA in 2006 for the Midnite mine site; (ii) Newmont and Dawn would reimburse the EPA for its past costs associated with overseeing the work; (iii) the Department of the Interior would contribute a lump sum amount toward past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite mine site; (iv) Newmont and Dawn would be responsible for all future EPA oversight costs and Midnite mine site cleanup costs; and (v) Newmont would post a surety bond for work at the site.\nDuring 2012, the Department of Interior contributed its share of past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite mine site. In 2016, Newmont completed the remedial design process, with the exception of the new WTP design which was awaiting the approval of the new NPDES permit. Subsequently, the new NPDES permit was received in 2017 and the WTP design commenced in 2018. The EPA approved the WTP design in 2021. Construction of the effluent pipeline began in 2021, and construction of the new WTP began in 2022. The WTP is projected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. Forest fires and droughts in the Pacific Northwest delayed the completion of the effluent pipeline until early 2025.\nThe Dawn mill site is regulated by the Washington Department of Health (the \"WDOH\") and is in the process of being closed in accordance with the federal Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act, and associated Washington state regulations. Remediation at the Dawn mill site began in 2013. The Tailing Disposal Area 1-4 reclamation earthworks component was completed during 2017 with the embankment erosion protection completed in the second quarter of 2018. The remaining closure activities consist primarily of finalizing an Alternative Concentration Limit application (the \"ACL application\") submitted in 2020 to the WDOH to address groundwater issues, and also evaporating the remaining balance of process water at the site. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the WDOH provided comments on the ACL application, which Newmont is evaluating and conducting studies to better understand and respond to the comments provided by the WDOH. These studies and the related comment process will extend beyond the current year and could result in future material increases to the remediation obligation.\nThe remediation liability for the Midnite mine site and Dawn mill site is approximately $\n168\n, assumed \n100\n% by Newmont, at December 31, 2024.\nGoldcorp Canada Ltd. - \n100\n% Newmont Owned\nPorcupine mine site.\n The Porcupine complex is comprised of active open pit and underground mining operations as well as inactive, legacy sites from its extensive history of mining gold in and around the city of Timmins, Ontario since the early 1900s. As a result of these primarily historic mining activities, there are mine hazards in the area that could require some form of reclamation. The Company is conducting studies to better catalog, prioritize, and update its existing information of these historical mine hazards, to inform its closure plans and estimated closure costs. Based on work performed during 2023, a $\n46\n reclamation adjustment was recorded at December 31, 2023, however, on-going studies will extend beyond the current year and could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at Porcupine.\nCadia Holdings Pty Ltd. - \n100\n% Newmont Owned\nCadia mine site.\n Cadia Holdings Pty Ltd. (“Cadia Holdings”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Newcrest, which was acquired by Newmont in November 2023. The mine site is subject to regulations by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (the “NSW EPA”). During the quarter ended June 2023, the NSW EPA issued variations to its Environment Protection License (“EPL”), a Prevention Notice and Notices to Provide Information regarding the management of, and investigation into potential breaches relating to, dust emissions and other air pollutants from Cadia Holdings’ tailings storage facilities and ventilation rises. The license variations largely formalized the actions Cadia Holdings had developed in consultation with the NSW EPA and was already undertaking across a range of measures. Cadia Holdings received a letter from the NSW EPA in June 2023 requiring it to immediately comply with specific statutory requirements and EPL conditions. Adjustments were implemented underground, including a reduction in mining rates, modifications to the ventilation circuit and the installation of additional dust sprays and spray curtains. Additional dust collection units were subsequently installed, enabling normal mining rates to be restored.\n193\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nIn August 2023, the NSW EPA commenced proceedings in the Land and Environment Court of NSW (the “NSW Land and Environment Court”) against Cadia Holdings, alleging that air emissions from Cadia on or about March 1, 2022 exceeded the standard of concentration for total solid particles permitted under applicable laws due to the use of surface exhaust fans at the mine. On September 29, 2023, Cadia Holdings entered a plea of guilty and the NSW Land and Environment Court listed the case for a sentencing hearing on June 21, 2024. On October 13, 2023, the NSW EPA commenced additional proceedings in the NSW Land and Environment Court against Cadia Holdings, alleging \ntwo\n additional contraventions of applicable air emissions requirements between November 3 and 5, 2021 and May 24 and 25, 2023 and \ntwo\n contraventions related to alleged air pollution from tailings storage facilities on October 13 and 31, 2022. On November 24, 2023, Cadia Holdings entered a plea of guilty to the \ntwo\n additional charges relating to applicable air emissions requirements and the sentencing hearing took place before the NSW Land and Environment Court on June 21, 2024. The matter has been adjourned pending the delivery of the judgment. On October 18, 2024, Cadia Holdings entered a plea of not guilty to the proceedings related to alleged air pollution from Cadia Holdings’ tailings storage facilities. The proceedings have been adjourned for further directions on February 21, 2025. The NSW EPA’s investigation regarding the management of air emissions from the mine is ongoing.\nWhile no specific relief has been sought by the NSW EPA in its proceedings against Cadia Holdings before the NSW Land and Environment Court, the court can impose penalties.\nOther Legal Matters\nNewmont Corporation, as well as Newmont Canada Corporation, and Newmont Canada FN Holdings ULC – \n100\n% Newmont Owned\nKirkland Lake Gold Inc., which was acquired by Agnico Eagle Mines Limited in 2022 (still referred to herein as “Kirkland” for ease of reference), owns certain mining and mineral rights in northeastern Ontario, Canada, referred to here as the Holt-McDermott property, on which it suspended operations in April 2020. A subsidiary of the Company has a retained royalty obligation (“Holt royalty obligation”) to Royal Gold, Inc. (“Royal Gold”) for production on the Holt-McDermott property. In August 2020, the Company and Kirkland signed a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the “Kirkland Agreement”). As part of the Kirkland Agreement, the Company purchased an option (the “Holt option”) for $\n75\n from Kirkland for the mining and mineral rights subject to the Holt royalty obligation. The Company has the right to exercise the Holt option and acquire ownership to the mineral interests subject to the Holt royalty obligation in the event Kirkland intends to resume operations and process material subject to the obligation. Kirkland has the right to assume the Company’s Holt royalty obligation at any time, in which case the Holt option would terminate.\nOn August 16, 2021, International Royalty Corporation (“IRC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, filed an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against Newmont Corporation, Newmont Canada Corporation, Newmont Canada FN Holdings ULC (collectively \"Newmont\"), and certain Kirkland defendants (collectively \"Kirkland\"). IRC alleges the Kirkland Agreement is oppressive to the interests of Royal Gold under the Nova Scotia Companies Act and the Canada Business Corporations Act, and that, by entering into the Kirkland Agreement, Newmont breached its contractual obligations to Royal Gold. IRC seeks declaratory relief, and $\n350\n in\n \nalleged royalty payments that it claims Newmont expected to pay under the Holt royalty obligation, but for the Kirkland Agreement. Kirkland filed a motion seeking dismissal of the case against it, which the court granted in October 2022. Newmont submitted its statement of defense on February 27, 2023, and a motion for summary judgment on January 12, 2024. The motion for summary judgment was denied on May 27, 2024. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.\nNewmont Ghana Gold Limited and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited - \n100\n% Newmont Owned\nOn December 24, 2018, \ntwo\n individual plaintiffs, who are members of the Ghana Parliament (“Plaintiffs”), filed a writ to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ghana. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the Statement of Plaintiff’s Case outlining the details of the Plaintiff’s case and subsequently served Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (“NGGL”) and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited (“NGRL”) along with the other named defendants, the Attorney General of Ghana, the Minerals Commission of Ghana and \n33\n other mining companies with interests in Ghana. The Plaintiffs allege that under article 268 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana, the mining company defendants are not entitled to carry out any exploitation of minerals or other natural resources in Ghana, unless their respective transactions, contracts or concessions are ratified or exempted from ratification by the Parliament of Ghana. Newmont’s current mining leases are both ratified by Parliament; NGGL June 13, 2001 mining lease, ratified by Parliament on October 21, 2008, and NGRL January 19, 2010 mining lease; ratified by Parliament on December 3, 2015. The writ alleges that any mineral exploitation prior to Parliamentary ratification is unconstitutional. The Plaintiffs seek several remedies including: (i) a declaration as to the meaning of constitutional language at issue; (ii) an injunction precluding exploitation of minerals for any mining company without prior Parliamentary ratification; (iii) a declaration that all revenue as a result of violation of the Constitution shall be accounted for and recovered via cash equivalent; and (iv) an order that the Attorney General and Minerals Commission submit all un-ratified mining leases, undertakings or contracts to Parliament for ratification. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.\nNewmont Capital Limited and Newmont Canada FN Holdings ULC – \n100\n% Newmont Owned \nThe Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) is conducting a limited review of the Company’s prior year tax returns. The ATO is reviewing an internal reorganization executed in 2011 when Newmont completed a restructure of the shareholding in the Company’s Australian subsidiaries. To date, the Company has responded to inquiries from the ATO and provided them with supporting \n194\nTable of Contents\nNEWMONT CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\ndocumentation for the transaction and the Company’s associated tax positions. One aspect of the ATO review relates to an Australian capital gains tax that applies to sales or transfers of stock in certain types of entities. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the ATO notified the Company that it believed the 2011 reorganization was subject to capital gains tax of approximately $\n85\n (including interest and penalties). The Company disputed this conclusion and is vigorously defending its position that the transaction is not subject to this tax. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made a $\n24\n payment to the ATO and lodged an appeal with the Australian Federal Court. The court proceedings were held during the third quarter of 2024 and the Company is currently awaiting the judgment, which is expected during the second quarter of 2025. The Company cannot reasonably predict the outcome.\nNewmont Corporation and Goldcorp Canada Ltd. – \n100\n% Newmont Owned \nOn November 20, 2024, Taykwa Tagamou Nation (“TTN\") filed a Statement of Claim in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against the Ontario government, as well as Newmont Corporation and Goldcorp Canada Ltd. (collectively “Newmont”), alleging that the resumption of open pit mining at the Pamour mine in Timmins, Ontario, Canada would be without proper consultation or consideration of the cumulative impacts of TTN’s traditional territory and Aboriginal rights, and as such, the associated environmental permits previously issued by the Ontario government with respect to Pamour ought to be revoked. TTN is seeking, amongst other things: (i) a stay of all activities authorized under the permits until the case is resolved, (ii) a declaration that Ontario breached its duty to consult and violated Treaty No. 9, and section 35 of the Constitution Act (Canada) 1982, and (iii) general and aggravated damages. Newmont remains steadfast in its commitment to foster meaningful and productive relationships with First Nation communities in Canada, and had undertaken appropriate consultations with various community stakeholders, including TTN and other First Nation groups in the Timmins area – as such, the permits were properly issued by the government. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.\nNewmont Corporation\nOn January 31, 2025, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against Newmont and Newmont’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The action was brought on behalf of an alleged class of Newmont stockholders who owned stock between February 22, 2024 and October 23, 2024 (the alleged class period). Plaintiffs allege that the defendants made a series of materially false and misleading statements and/or omissions during the alleged class period regarding the Company’s projected revenue outlook and ability to deliver higher grades of gold and mineral production in violation of federal securities laws. Plaintiffs further allege that the purported class members suffered losses and damages resulting from declines in the market value of Newmont’s common stock after the Company announced its third quarter 2024 results and updated guidance on October 23, 2024. Plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nAs part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit and bank guarantees as financial support for various purposes, including environmental remediation, reclamation, exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were $\n2,086\n and $\n2,123\n, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the Company addresses through its ongoing operations. As the specific requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until closure. Generally, bonding requirements associated with environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. However, the Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements through existing or alternative means, as they arise.\nNewmont is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings related to its business. Except in the above described proceedings, management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or that amounts that may be required to be paid by reason thereof will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with the Company's investment in Galore Creek, Newmont will owe NovaGold Resources Inc. $\n75\n upon the earlier of approval to construct a mine, mill and all related infrastructure for the Galore Creek project or the initiation of construction of a mine, mill or related infrastructure. The amount due is non-interest bearing. The decision for an approval and commencement of construction is contingent on the results of a prefeasibility study which is currently under way and feasibility study which has not yet occurred.\n195\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.       CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A.       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013. Based upon its assessment, management concluded that, at December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nAs permitted by the SEC Staff interpretive guidance for proportionately consolidated entities, the Company’s management excluded NGM from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2024, as management does not have the ability to dictate, modify or assess the controls at NGM. The Company has implemented internal controls over financial reporting for recognizing its proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, and operations of NGM. Refer to Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for NGM's \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\" for Opinion on the Financial Statements and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.\nNGM represented 13% of the Company’s consolidated \nTotal assets\n at December 31, 2024, while its \nSales \ncomprised 13% of the Company’s consolidated sales and its \nNet income attributable to Newmont stockholders\n comprised 20% of the Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, is included in this Item under the heading \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nSubject to the above, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n196\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Newmont Corporation \nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Newmont Corporation’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe did not audit the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of Nevada Gold Mines LLC, a 38.5% owned investment which is proportionately consolidated, whose financial statements reflect total assets constituting 13% of consolidated assets as of December 31, 2024 and sales constituting 13% of consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of Nevada Gold Mines LLC’s internal control over financial reporting was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the effectiveness of Nevada Gold Mines LLC’s internal control over financial reporting, is based solely on the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes and financial statement schedule in Item 15(a)(2), and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon, based on our audit and the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit and the report PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \nDenver, Colorado\nFebruary 20, 2025\n197\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.       OTHER INFORMATION\n(a) Disclosure Pursuant to Item 5.03 of Form 8-K. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws\nOn February 19, 2025, the Board of Directors amended and restated the Company’s By-Laws (the “Amended and Restated By-Laws”). The Amended and Restated By-Laws became effective as of February 19, 2025. Among other changes, the Amended and Restated By-Laws (i) address certain matters related to Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act and clarify certain disclosure requirements in Article I, Section 4 (Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations), Section 4A (Inclusion of Stockholder Director Nominations in the Corporation’s Proxy Materials) and Section 4B (Submission of Questionnaire, Representation and Agreement); (ii) modify Article I, Section 7 to align more closely with the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) and current practices regarding access to stockholder lists and provisions relating to stockholder meetings held by remote communication; (iii) clarify the roles of the Chief Accounting Officer and Controller; and (iv) establish the state courts of the state of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware) as the exclusive forum for specified actions relating to the Company, including derivative actions, actions asserting claims based on breach of fiduciary duties, actions asserting claims pursuant to the any provision of the DGCL, the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws, and actions asserting claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine or asserting an “internal corporate claim” as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. The Amended and Restated By-Laws also make clarifications, updates and other, non-substantive changes. This description of the amendments to the Amended and Restated By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Amended and Restated By-Laws filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(b) Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nOur directors and executive officers may purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time, including pursuant to equity trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and in compliance with guidelines specified by the Company’s stock trading standard, which has been filed as Exhibit 19 to this annual report. In accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and the Company’s insider trading policy, directors, officers and certain employees who, at such time, are not in possession of material non-public information about the Company are permitted to enter into written plans that pre-establish amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity plans (a “Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan”). Under the Company’s stock trading standard, the first trade made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan may take place no earlier than 90 days after adoption of the trading plan. Under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the director or executive officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from them. The use of these trading plans permits asset diversification as well as financial and tax planning. Our directors and executive officers also may buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information, subject to compliance with SEC rules, the terms of our stock trading standard and holding requirements. During the three months ended December 31, 2024, the following directors and executive officers \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n Rule 10b5-1 trading plans intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c):\nOn \nDecember 16, 2024\n, \nTom Palmer\n, \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n, \nterminated\n a trading arrangement previously adopted with respect to the sale of securities of the Company’s common stock. Mr. Palmer’s Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan was adopted on March 28, 2024, had a term of 11 months, and provided for the sale of up to \n104,000\n shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the plan. As of the date of termination of the Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan, Mr. Palmer had sold 99,000 shares of common stock under its terms. The adoption of such 10b5-1 Trading Plan, and its subsequent termination, each occurred during an open insider trading window and complied with the Company’s standards on insider trading.\nTransactions under Section 16 officer trading plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the SEC to the extent required by law. No other Section 16 director or officer of the Company adopted, modified, or terminated Rule 10b5-1 trading plans during the covered period.
