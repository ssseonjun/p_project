  "item1_summary": " Our homebuilding, rental and land development operations are cyclical and significantly affected by changes in economic, real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business and financial results . Changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than other than other regions . These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner .\n Federal Reserve’s monetary policies could negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence . The increase in mortgage interest rates has reduced the affordability of our homes and has required us to use pricing adjustments and incentives to adapt to current market conditions . Deployments of U.S. military personnel to foreign regions, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or threats to national security could adversely affect our business .\n An increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages . A decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business . We establish reserves for estimated losses and future repurchase obligations for mortgage loans we have sold .\n The failure of a bank or other adverse conditions impacting financial institutions where we have cash balances could adversely impact our liquidity and capital resources . Adverse developments affecting the capital markets and financial institutions, or concerns or rumors about such events, may limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing . Our homebuilding operations utilize a $2.305 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature .\n As of September 30, 2025, Forestar had a $640 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $1.0 billion . The facility includes bank commitments of $600 million maturing on December 18, 2029 and $65 million on October 28, 2026 .\n The rental revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, rental or Forestar operations . Adverse changes in market conditions could make renewal of the facility more difficult or result in an increase in the cost of this facility or a decrease in the committed amounts . We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business .\n D.R. Horton, Inc. has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in July 2024, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined . Forestar also has an effective shelf registration . statement filed in September 2024 registering $750 million of equity securities, of which $300 million is reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program .\n During fiscal 2025, approximately 71% of our mortgage loans were sold directly to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or into securities backed by Ginnie Mae, and 27% were sold to one other major financial entity . The secondary market for mortgage loans continues to primarily desire securities . The liquidity these agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market .\n The risks associated with our land, lot and rental inventory could adversely affect our business and financial results . There are risks inherent in controlling, owning and developing land . The values of our owned undeveloped land, lots and inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions . A significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges .\n Investments in land, lots, home inventories and rental properties can expose us to risks of economic loss and asset impairments . Integration of these transactions may not be successful and may require significant time and resources, which may divert management’s attention from other operations . Acquisitions and investments could also raise new compliance-related obligations .\n Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation, higher interest rates or deflation . Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials, labor and our cost of capital . We may have difficulty selling an investment or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner . A significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels .\n The homebuilding and lot development industries have from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction . These or other factors related to deflation could have a negative impact on our business and financial results . The value of our inventories could also reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance .\n Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanic activity, droughts, floods, hailstorms, heavy or prolonged precipitation, wildfires and others, can harm our business . Public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our operations .\n The climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate, including California, Florida, Texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations, present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters . Any such events can temporarily delay our development work, home construction and home construction, unfavorably affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, damage homes under construction .\n Contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions and claim reserves . Some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed coverage limits . We cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims .\n A health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liability and reputational damage . Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against . We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in any litigation that has been or may be instituted or asserted against us .\n At September 30, 2025, we had $3.5 billion of outstanding surety bonds . Our ability to obtain surety . bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating, financial condition, past performance and other factors, including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers . Increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes .\n Information technology failures, cybersecurity incidents, and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations could harm our business . phishing attacks, whereby perpetrators attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, vendors or other users of a company’s systems to disclose personal information to gain access to its data, have increased significantly in recent years .\n Remote work environments and virtual platforms may increase our risk of cyber incidents that could compromise our data . Geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create a heightened risk of these incidents . The unintended or unauthorized disclosure of personal identifying and confidential information as a result of a cybersecurity incident could lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by the affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators .\n We use various encryption, tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks . Failure to comply with these requirements or other applicable laws and regulations in this area could result in substantial penalties, reputational damage or litigation . We may also incur costs to adapt our cybersecurity program to the evolving threat landscape and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other identified risks .\n A breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations, damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers . We cannot provide assurances that a cyber incident, including data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations .\n The impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties . Government agencies routinely initiate audits, reviews or investigations of our business practices . Such restrictions and requirements could increase our operating and compliance costs or require additional technology and capital investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations . We believe we are in compliance in all material r. ations concerning protection of health, safety, labor standards and the environment .\n In March 2024, the SEC adopted new rules regarding climate-related disclosures . These rules were subsequently challenged in legal proceedings, and their effectiveness was stayed by the SEC pending judicial review . Increasing governmental and societal attention to sustainability matters could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report . Any of the above factors may alter the environment in which we do business .\n The company is subject to income taxes at the federal, state and local levels, and any changes in tax legislation could adversely affect our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets . The subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations, including laws involving matters that are not within our control .\n We operate in competitive industries, and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results . We compete not only for homebuyers and renters, but also for desirable properties, raw materials, skilled labor and financing . The competitive conditions can negatively affect our sales volumes, selling prices, leased occupancy levels, rental rates and incentive levels .\n Our businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees, managers and executives . We have significant amounts of debt and may incur additional debt, which could affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or potential acquisitions . As of September 30, 2025, our consolidated debt was $6.0 billion .\n The rental revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on the ability of DRH Rental and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt . The mortgage repurchase facilities impose restrictions on DHI Mortgage’s restricted subsidiaries . The Forestar revolving . credit facility and the indentures governing Forestar’ . senior notes . The amount and the maturities of our debt and the debt of our . subsidiaries could have important consequences, including the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payment of debt .\n Our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on our ability to pay for our operations . Changes in the cost of our debt service obligations may affect the amount of money we have to pay . We are also affected by factors beyond our control, such as financial and political factors, which may affect our financial situation .\n The agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our and our guarantor subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions with respect to certain assets, incur secured debt, create liens, pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities, sell certain assets and engage in mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets .\n The rental and Forestar revolving credit facilities each contain financial covenants requiring the maintenance by DRH Rental or Forestar, as applicable, of a minimum level of tangible net worth . Failure to comply with these covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the applicable revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity .\n Our access to capital and our ability to obtain additional credit could be affected by any change of our debt ratings . Any lowering of the debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets more difficult and/or more expensive . Our right to receive funds from our financial services subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries .\n A change of control (as defined in our homebuilding revolving credit facility) would constitute an event of default under the facility, which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under facility . Forestar’s 5.5% senior notes due 2035 and 4.85% notes due 2030, $150 million or more, were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied . In either case within 30 days, all such notes were declared due and payable immediately .\n Forestar will be required to offer to repurchase Forestar’s notes at 101% of their principal amount, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, if any. occurrence of a change of control triggering event . Change of control (as defined in the Forestar revolving credit facility) with respect to Forestar would constitute an event of default .\n A change of control (as defined in the rental revolving credit facility agreement) with respect to DRH Rental would constitute an event of default . The company could not guarantee sufficient funds to pay the required amounts . The risk of default could result in the acceleration of the repurchase of any loans outstanding under the facilities and an increase in the price of such loans .\n Our reputation could be adversely affected by actual or perceived failures or concerns related to ethics, compliance, product quality and safety, environmental matters, privacy, diversity and inclusion, human rights, compensation and benefits and corporate governance, among other things . Negative publicity can be disseminated rapidly through digital platforms, including social media, websites, blogs and newsletters .\n Our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others . We seek to retain our key personnel, to have succession and transition plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel . Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations . Activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business .\n Risks from cybersecurity threats include unauthorized access, data theft, computer viruses, ransomware, malicious software and other disruptions . We have implemented a multilayered, proactive approach to identify, evaluate, mitigate and prevent potential cybersecurity threats . We secure access to our network and systems through multi-factor authentication . We conduct weekly and monthly scans to identify and prioritize the mitigation of the most critical vulnerabilities .\n In addition to the above-described technology controls, we have implemented mandatory training and awareness programs designed to educate our employees on cybersecurity risks . We maintain a documented incident response readiness process that details the procedures to follow in the event of a security incident . We have not identified any risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have occurred .\n The sophistication of cybersecurity threats continues to increase with rapidly evolving techniques to overcome security measures . However, the preventative actions we have taken and will continue to take to reduce the risks may not successfully protect our systems against a future cybersecurity incident .
