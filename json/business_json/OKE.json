Through our 100% ownership of the managing member of EnLink, we obtained control of EnLink. We used a portion of the proceeds from our September 2024 underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes to fund this acquisition.\nThis acquisition meaningfully increases our scale and integrated value chain within the growing Permian Basin while expanding and extending our asset bases in the Mid-Continent, North Texas and Louisiana regions.  We expect to achieve significant synergies by combining our complementary asset positions.  Financial results and operating information related to the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition impacts all four business segments and is included with “Financial Results and Operating Information” for the period Oct. 15, 2024 to Dec. 31, 2024. \nEnLink Acquisition\n - On Nov. 24, 2024, we entered into the EnLink Merger Agreement to acquire all of the publicly held EnLink Units in an all stock, tax-free transaction.  On Jan. 31, 2025, we completed the EnLink Acquisition.  Pursuant to the EnLink Merger Agreement, each common unit of EnLink was exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.1412 shares of ONEOK common stock, including EnLink Units that were exchanged for all previously outstanding Series B Preferred Units immediately prior to closing.  We issued 41 million shares of common stock, with a fair value of $4.0 billion as of the closing date of the EnLink Acquisition.  EnLink is now a wholly owned subsidiary.\nMedallion Acquisition \n- On Oct. 31, 2024, we completed the Medallion Acquisition with GIP, acquiring all of the equity interests in Medallion for total consideration of $2.6 billion, inclusive of the purchase of additional interests in a Medallion joint venture owned by a separate third party.  We used a portion of the proceeds from our September 2024 underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes to fund this acquisition.  This acquisition expands our midstream services for crude oil and condensate in West Texas, specifically in the Midland Basin.  Financial results and operating information related to the Medallion Acquisition impacts our Refined Products and Crude segment and is included with \"Financial Results and Operating Information\" for the period Nov. 1, 2024 to Dec. 31, 2024.\nInterstate Natural Gas Pipeline Divestiture\n - On Dec. 31, 2024, we completed sale of three of our wholly owned interstate natural gas pipeline systems to DT Midstream, Inc. for total cash consideration of $1.2 billion, and recognized a gain of $227 million.  With a portion of the proceeds of the sale, we repaid the Guardian Term Loan Agreement and the Viking Term Loan Agreement.  This transaction aligns and enhances our capital allocation priorities within our integrated value chain. \nGulf Coast NGL Pipelines Acquisition\n - On June 17, 2024, we completed the acquisition of a system of NGL pipelines from Easton Energy, a Houston-based midstream company, for approximately $280 million.  This acquisition in our Natural Gas Liquids segment includes approximately 450 miles of liquids products pipelines located in the strategic Gulf Coast market centers for NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil.  A portion of the Easton assets are already connected to our Mont Belvieu assets.  We expect to add connections to our Houston-based assets beginning in mid-2025 through the end of 2025.\nFor additional information on our most recent acquisitions and divestiture, see Part II, Item 8, Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  See Part 1,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion of risks related to these transactions. \nJoint Ventures\n - On Feb. 4, 2025, we entered into definitive agreements to form joint ventures with MPLX LP (MPLX) to construct a 400 MBbl/d liquified petroleum gas export terminal in Texas City, Texas, and a new 24-inch pipeline from our Mont Belvieu, Texas, storage facility to the new terminal.  Texas City Logistics LLC, the export terminal joint venture, is owned 50% by us and 50% by MPLX, with MPLX constructing and operating the facility.  MBTC Pipeline LLC, the pipeline joint venture, is owned 80% by us and 20% by MPLX, and we will construct and operate the pipeline.  We expect to invest approximately $1.0 billion in these projects.  \n47\nTable of Contents\nMarket Condition\n - Earnings increased in 2024, compared with 2023, due primarily to a full year of earnings from our new Refined Products and Crude segment, higher NGL and natural gas processing volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and the impact of the interstate pipeline divestiture in the Natural Gas Pipelines segment.  Our extensive and integrated assets are located in, and connected with, some of the most productive shale basins, as well as refineries and demand centers, in the United States.  \nCapital Projects \n- Our primary capital projects are outlined in the table below: \nProject\nScope\nApproximate\nCosts (a)\nExpected Completion\nNatural Gas Liquids\n(In millions)\nMB-6 fractionator\n125 MBbl/d NGL fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Texas\n$550\nCompleted\nWest Texas NGL pipeline expansion\nIncrease capacity via pipeline looping in the Permian Basin\n$520\nCompleted\nElk Creek pipeline expansion\nIncrease capacity to 435 MBbl/d out of the Rocky Mountain region\n$355\nCompleted (b)\nMedford fractionator\nRebuild our 210 MBbl/d NGL fractionation facility in Medford, Oklahoma\n$385\n(c)\nRefined Products and Crude\nGreater Denver pipeline expansion\nIncrease total system capacity by 35 MBbl/d and additional expansion capabilities\n$480\nMid-2026\n(a) - Excludes capitalized interest/AFUDC.\n(b) - We completed construction in January 2025, and the project is partially in service.  Following supply of full power, expected in mid-2025, we will reach the full capacity of 435 MBbl/d.\n(c) - This project is expected to be completed in two phases, with the first phase expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2026, and the second phase completed in the first quarter of 2027.\nIn our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, we have a capital project to relocate a 150 MMcf/d processing plant to the Permian Basin from North Texas, which we expect to be in service in the first quarter of 2026. \nDebt Issuances\n - In September 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes consisting of $1.25 billion, 4.25% senior notes due 2027; $600 million, 4.4% senior notes due 2029; $1.25 billion, 4.75% senior notes due 2031; $1.6 billion, 5.05% senior notes due 2034; $1.5 billion, 5.7% senior notes due 2054; and $800 million, 5.85% senior notes due 2064.  The net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were $6.9 billion.  The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and the Medallion Acquisition, purchase additional interests in a Medallion joint venture owned by a separate third party, to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisitions and to repay outstanding indebtedness.\nDebt Repayments\n - In December 2024, we redeemed our $500 million, 4.9% senior notes due March 2025 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.\nIn September 2024, we repaid the remaining $484 million of our $500 million, 2.75% senior notes at maturity with cash on hand.\nShare Repurchase Program\n - In January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock.  We expect shares to be acquired from time to time in open-market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors.  We expect any purchases to be funded by cash on hand, cash flow from operations and short-term borrowings.  The program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $2.0 billion of common stock or on Jan. 1, 2029, whichever occurs first.  As of Feb. 17, 2025, we repurchased 1.675 million shares for $172 million under the program.\nDividends\n - During 2024, we paid common stock dividends totaling $3.96 per share, an increase of 3.7% compared to the 2023 dividend of $3.82 per share.  In February 2025, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.03 per share ($4.12 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 4% compared with the same quarter in the prior year.  Our dividend growth is due primarily to the increase in cash flows resulting from the growth of our operations.  The quarterly stock dividend was paid on Feb. 14, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 3, 2025. \n48\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATING INFORMATION\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nManagement uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance.  Our consolidated financial metrics include: (1) operating income; (2) net income; (3) diluted EPS; and (4) adjusted EBITDA.  We evaluate segment operating results using adjusted EBITDA and our operating metrics, which include various volume and rate statistics that are relevant for the respective segment.  These operating metrics allow investors to analyze the various components of segment financial results in terms of volumes and rate/price.  Management uses these metrics to analyze historical segment financial results and as the key inputs for forecasting and budgeting segment financial results.  For additional information on our operating metrics, see the respective segment subsections of this “Financial Results and Operating Information” section.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n - Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of our financial performance.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense and certain other noncash items.  Following the Magellan Acquisition, we performed a review of our calculation methodology of adjusted EBITDA and, beginning in 2023, we updated our calculation to include the adjusted EBITDA related to our unconsolidated affiliates using the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in net earnings from investments.  In prior periods, our calculation included equity in net earnings from investments.  This change resulted in an additional $62 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods.  Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated affiliates is calculated consistently with the definition above and excludes items such as interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income taxes and other noncash items.  Although the amounts related to our unconsolidated affiliates are included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, such inclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues, expenses or cash flows of such unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it and similar measures are used by many companies in our industry as a measurement of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare financial performance among companies in our industry.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, EPS or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.  Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.  See reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” subsection.\nConsolidated Operations\nSelected Financial Results\n - The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for the periods indicated:\n \nYears Ended Dec. 31, \n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nFinancial Results\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$ Increase (Decrease)\n \n(\nMillions of dollars, except per share amounts\n)\nRevenues\nCommodity sales\n$\n17,780\n \n$\n15,614 \n$\n20,976 \n2,166\n \n(5,362)\nServices and other\n3,918\n \n2,063 \n1,411 \n1,855\n \n652 \nTotal revenues\n21,698\n \n17,677 \n22,387 \n4,021\n \n(4,710)\nCost of sales and fuel (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n13,311\n \n11,929 \n17,910 \n1,382\n \n(5,981)\nOperating costs\n2,496\n \n1,535 \n1,149 \n961\n \n386 \nDepreciation and amortization\n1,134\n \n769 \n626 \n365\n \n143 \nTransaction costs\n73\n \n158 \n— \n(85)\n158 \nOther operating income, net\n(305)\n(786)\n(105)\n(481)\n681 \nOperating income\n$\n4,989\n \n$\n4,072 \n$\n2,807 \n917\n \n1,265 \nEquity in net earnings from investments\n$\n439\n \n$\n202 \n$\n148 \n237\n \n54 \nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest\n$\n(1,371)\n$\n(866)\n$\n(676)\n505\n \n190 \nNet income\n$\n3,112\n \n$\n2,659 \n$\n1,722 \n453\n \n937 \nNet income attributable to ONEOK\n$\n3,035\n \n$\n2,659 \n$\n1,722 \n376\n \n937 \nDiluted EPS\n$\n5.17\n \n$\n5.48 \n$\n3.84 \n(0.31)\n1.64 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n6,784\n \n$\n5,243 \n$\n3,620 \n1,541\n \n1,623 \nCapital expenditures\n$\n2,021\n \n$\n1,595 \n$\n1,202 \n426\n \n393 \n49\nTable of Contents\nChanges in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenues and cost of sales and fuel in our Consolidated Statements of Income and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items. \nDue to the Medallion Acquisition and EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, operating results for these two companies are included in our financial results beginning Nov. 1, 2024 and Oct. 15, 2024, respectively.  \n2024 vs. 2023 \n- Operating income increased $917 million primarily as a result of the following:\n•\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing\n - an increase of $181 million due primarily to the operating income of EnLink, higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and the sale of certain non-strategic assets, offset partially by lower realized NGL prices, net of hedging, and higher operating costs; \noffset by\n•\nNatural Gas Liquids\n - a decrease of $564 million due primarily to an insurance settlement gain in 2023 related to the Medford incident and higher operating costs, offset partially by an increase in exchange services due primarily to higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and to the operating income of EnLink; \noffset by\n•\nNatural Gas Pipelines \n- an\n \nincrease of $291 million due primarily to the interstate natural gas pipeline divestiture in 2024, higher transportation services and the operating income of EnLink; \n•\nRefined Products and Crude\n - an increase of $934 million due to a full year of operating income following the Magellan Acquisition in 2023 and the operating income of Medallion and EnLink in 2024; \nand\n•\nConsolidated Transaction Costs \n- a decrease of $85 million due primarily to higher transaction costs related to the Magellan Acquisition in 2023.\nNet income increased due primarily to the items discussed above and higher equity in net earnings from investments, offset partially by higher interest expense due to higher debt balances resulting from the August 2023 $5.25 billion notes offering, the September 2024 $7.0 billion notes offering and the acquired debt balances from both the Magellan Acquisition in 2023 and the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition in 2024.\nDiluted EPS decreased due primarily to the impact of the insurance settlement gain in 2023 related to the Medford incident\n.\nCapital expenditures increased due primarily to our capital projects.

Our growth strategy is focused on connecting diversified raw feed supply basins to Purity NGL export, petrochemical and refining demand centers.  See “Capital Projects” in the “Recent Developments” section for more information on our capital projects.\n51\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024, we connected one third-party natural gas processing plant in the Permian Basin to our system, and two third-party natural gas processing plants previously connected to our system were expanded, one in the Permian Basin and one in the Mid-Continent region. \nFor a discussion of our capital expenditure financing, see “Capital Expenditures” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section.\nSelected Financial Results and Operating Information\n - The following tables set forth certain selected financial results and operating information for our Natural Gas Liquids segment for the periods indicated:\n \nYears Ended Dec. 31, \n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nFinancial Results\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$ Increase (Decrease)\n \n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\nNGL and condensate sales\n$\n14,446\n \n$\n13,666 \n$\n18,329 \n780\n \n(4,663)\nExchange service and other revenues\n514\n \n559 \n558 \n(45)\n1 \nTransportation and storage revenues\n207\n \n204 \n180 \n3\n \n24 \nCost of sales and fuel (exclusive of depreciation and operating costs)\n(11,994)\n(11,592)\n(16,546)\n402\n \n(4,954)\nOperating costs, excluding noncash compensation adjustments\n(728)\n(637)\n(549)\n91\n \n88 \nAdjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates (a)\n95\n \n67 \n— \n28\n \n67 \nEquity in net earnings from investments (a)\n—\n \n— \n35 \n(35)\nOther\n3\n \n778 \n88 \n(775)\n690 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,543\n \n$\n3,045 \n$\n2,095 \n(502)\n950 \nCapital expenditures\n$\n987\n \n$\n818 \n$\n581 \n169\n \n237 \n(a) - Beginning in 2023, we updated our calculation methodology of adjusted EBITDA to include adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated affiliates, which resulted in an additional $9 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods. \nChanges in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenues and cost of sales and fuel and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items. \n2024 vs. 2023\n - Adjusted EBITDA decreased $502 million primarily as a result of the following:\n•\na decrease of $695 million related to the Medford incident, due primarily to an insurance settlement gain in 2023 of $779 million, offset partially by $84 million of lower third-party fractionation costs in the current year;\n•\nan increase of $77 million in operating costs due primarily to planned asset maintenance, higher employee-related costs and property taxes from the growth of our operations; \nand\n•\na decrease of $9 million in optimization and marketing due primarily to lower earnings on sales of Purity NGLs held in inventory; \noffset by\n•\nan increase of $184 million in exchange services due primarily to higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain region, higher average fee rates and wider commodity price differentials, offset partially by lower volumes in the Gulf Coast/Permian and Mid-Continent regions, and higher transportation costs;\n•\nan increase of $59 million due to adjusted EBITDA from EnLink; \nand\n•\nan increase of $31 million in adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates due primarily to higher volumes delivered to the Overland Pass Pipeline.\nCapital expenditures increased in 2024 due primarily to capital projects, which includes our MB-6 fractionator and pipeline expansion projects.\n \nYears Ended Dec. 31, \nOperating Information\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRaw feed throughput (\nMBbl/d\n) (a)\n1,309\n \n1,359 \n1,237 \nAverage Conway-to-Mont Belvieu Oil Price Information Service price differential - \nethane in ethane/propane mix (\n$/gallon\n)\n$\n0.01\n \n$\n0.04 \n$\n0.04 \n(a) - Represents physical raw feed volumes for which we provide transportation and/or fractionation services, and excludes EnLink, as EnLink operating statistics are not meaningful to full-year 2024 operating results.\nWe generally expect ethane volumes to increase or decrease with corresponding increases or decreases in overall NGL production.  However, ethane volumes may experience growth or decline greater than corresponding growth or decline in overall NGL production due to ethane economics causing producers to recover or reject ethane. \n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 vs. 2023\n - While exchange services earnings increased, volumes decreased in 2024 due primarily to the expiration of low-margin contracts in the prior year and lower volumes in the Permian Basin, offset partially by increased production in the Rocky Mountain region at higher fee rates.\nNatural Gas Pipelines\nCapital Projects\n - Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment invests in capital projects that provide transportation and storage services to end users.  We recently reactivated previously idled storage facilities with 3 Bcf of working gas storage capacity in Texas.  In addition, we are in the process of expanding our storage injection capabilities in Oklahoma, adding 4 Bcf of working gas storage capacity, which we expect to be complete in the second quarter of 2025.\nFor a discussion of our capital expenditure financing, see “Capital Expenditures” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section.\nInterstate Natural Gas Pipeline Divestiture\n - On Nov. 19, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with DT Midstream, Inc. to sell three of our wholly owned interstate natural gas pipeline systems.  On Dec. 31, 2024, we completed the sale and recognized a gain of $227 million.\nSelected Financial Results and Operating Information\n - The following tables set forth certain selected financial results and operating information for our Natural Gas Pipelines segment for the periods indicated:\n \nYears Ended Dec. 31, \n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nFinancial Results\n2024\n2023\n2022\n $ Increase (Decrease)\n \n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\nTransportation revenues\n$\n523\n \n$\n423 \n$\n409 \n100\n \n14 \nStorage revenues\n161\n \n159 \n130 \n2\n \n29 \nResidue natural gas sales and other revenues\n138\n \n41 \n40 \n97\n \n1 \nCost of sales and fuel (exclusive of depreciation and operating costs)\n(112)\n(28)\n(25)\n84\n \n3 \nOperating costs, excluding noncash compensation adjustments\n(225)\n(194)\n(174)\n31\n \n20 \nAdjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates (a)\n187\n \n160 \n— \n27\n \n160 \nEquity in net earnings from investments (a)\n— \n— \n108 \n—\n \n(108)\nOther\n228\n \n(2)\n— \n230\n \n(2)\nAdjusted EBITDA \n$\n900\n \n$\n559 \n$\n488 \n341\n \n71 \nCapital expenditures\n$\n258\n \n$\n228 \n$\n123 \n30\n \n105 \n(a) - Beginning in 2023, we updated our calculation methodology of adjusted EBITDA to include adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated affiliates, which resulted in an additional $42 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods. \n2024 vs. 2023\n - Adjusted EBITDA increased $341 million primarily as a result of the following:\n•\nan increase of $227 million due to the interstate natural gas pipeline divestiture; \n•\nan increase of $75 million in transportation services due primarily to higher firm and interruptible rates;\n•\nan increase of $41 million due to adjusted EBITDA from EnLink; \nand\n•\nan increase of $16 million in adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates due primarily to increased volumes on Northern Border; \noffset by\n•\nan increase of $19 million in operating costs due primarily to planned asset maintenance and employee-related costs.\nCapital expenditur\ne\ns increased in 2024 due primarily to capital projects and timing of maintenance projects.  \n \nYears Ended Dec. 31, \nOperating Information (a)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNatural gas transportation capacity contracted (\nMDth/d\n)\n8,176\n \n7,743 \n7,428 \nTransportation capacity contracted\n97\n \n%\n96 \n%\n94 \n%\n(a) - Includes volumes for consolidated entities only and excludes EnLink, as EnLink operating statistics are not meaningful to full-year 2024 operating results.\n2024 vs. 2023\n - \nNatural gas transportation capacity contrac\nted increased due primarily to the completion of expansion projects on our assets.\n53\nTable of Contents\nRefined Products and Crude\nCapital Projects\n - Our Refined Products and Crude segment invests in capital projects to transport, store and distribute Refined Products and crude oil primarily throughout the central United States.  Our growth strategy is focused on expanding our core business and marketing presence.  See “Capital Projects” in the “Recent Developments” section for more information on our capital projects.\nFor a discussion of our capital expenditure financing, see “Capital Expenditures” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section.\nSelected Financial Results and Operating Information\n - The following tables set forth certain selected financial results and operating information for our Refined Products and Crude segment for the periods indicated:\nFinancial Results\nYear Ended Dec.  31, 2024\nSept. 25 through Dec. 31, 2023 (a)\n \n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\nProduct sales\n$\n2,258\n \n$\n502\n \nTransportation revenues\n1,539\n \n392\n \nStorage, terminals and other revenues\n663\n \n177\n \nCost of sales and fuel (exclusive of depreciation and operating costs)\n(1,949)\n(450)\nOperating costs, excluding noncash compensation adjustments\n(857)\n(192)\nAdjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates\n247\n \n36\n \nOther\n(9)\n—\n \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,892\n \n$\n465\n \nCapital expenditures\n$\n216\n \n$\n52\n \n(a) - \nT\nhe year ended Dec. 31, 2023, includes results subsequent to the Magellan Acquisition.\nChanges in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenues and cost of sales and fuel in our Consolidated Statements of Income and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items.\n2024 vs. 2023\n - Adjusted EBITDA increased $1,427 million as a result of the following:\n•\nan increase of $1,354 million due to a full-year of operating results following the Magellan Acquisition, which includes a non-recurring increase in adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates of $88 million due primarily to BridgeTex; \nand\n \n•\nan increase of $73 million due to adjusted EBITDA from Medallion and EnLink.\nOperating Information (a)\nYear Ended\nDec. 31, 2024\nThree Months Ended Dec. 31, 2023 \nRefined Products volume shipped (\nMBbl/d\n)\n1,512\n \n1,547\n \nCrude oil volume shipped (\nMBbl/d\n)\n783\n \n808\n \n(a) - Includes volumes for consolidated entities only and excludes Medallion and EnLink, as Medallion and EnLink operating statistics are not meaningful to full-year 2024 operating results.\nMarket conditions and seasonality can cause volume fluctuations in a single quarter that are not representative of full-year results.  \n54\nTable of Contents\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the nearest comparable GAAP financial performance measure, to adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended Dec. 31, \n(\nUnaudited\n)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nReconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA\n(Millions of dollars)\nNet income\n$\n3,112\n \n$\n2,659 \n$\n1,722 \nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest\n1,371\n \n866 \n676 \nDepreciation and amortization\n1,134\n \n769 \n626 \nIncome taxes\n998\n \n838 \n528 \nAdjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates (a)\n532\n \n264 \n— \nEquity in net earnings from investments (a)\n(439)\n(202)\n— \nNoncash compensation expense and other \n76\n \n49 \n68 \nAdjusted EBITDA (a)(b)(c)(d)\n$\n6,784\n \n$\n5,243 \n$\n3,620 \nReconciliation of segment adjusted EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA\nSegment adjusted EBITDA:\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing\n$\n1,484\n \n$\n1,244 \n$\n1,037 \nNatural Gas Liquids (b)\n2,543\n \n3,045 \n2,095 \nNatural Gas Pipelines (d)\n900\n \n559 \n488 \nRefined Products and Crude (e)\n1,892\n \n465 \n— \nOther (c)\n(35)\n(70)\n— \nAdjusted EBITDA (a)(b)(c)(d)\n$\n6,784\n \n$\n5,243 \n$\n3,620 \n(a) - Beginning in 2023, we updated our calculation methodology of adjusted EBITDA to include adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated affiliates using the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in net earnings from investments.  In prior periods, our calculation included equity in net earnings from investments.  This change resulted in an additional $62 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods.\n(b) - The year ended Dec. 31, 2023, includes $633 million related to the Medford incident, including a settlement gain of $779 million, offset partially by $146 million of third-party fractionation costs.\n(c) - The year ended Dec. 31, 2024 includes transaction costs related primarily to the EnLink Acquisitions and Medallion Acquisition of $73 million, offset partially by interest income of $39 million.  The year ended Dec. 31, 2023, includes transaction costs related to the Magellan Acquisition of $158 million, offset partially by interest income of $49 million and net gains of $41 million on extinguishment of debt related to open market repurchases.  \n(d) - The year ended Dec. 31, 2024, includes a gain of $227 million from the interstate natural gas pipeline divestiture.\n(e) - The year ended Dec. 31, 2023, includes segment adjusted EBITDA for the period Sept. 25, 2023, through Dec. 31, 2023.\nCONTINGENCIES\nSee Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for a discussion of regulatory and legal matters.\nOther Legal Proceedings\n - We are a party to various legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of our operations.  While the results of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the reasonably possible losses from such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, are not material.  Additionally, we believe the probable final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\n - Our primary sources of cash inflows are operating cash flows, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, debt issuances and the issuance of common stock for our liquidity and capital resources requirements.\nWe expect our sources of cash inflows to provide sufficient resources to finance our operations, capital expenditures, quarterly cash dividends, maturities of long-term debt, share repurchases and contributions to unconsolidated affiliates.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity due to our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, which expires in February 2030, and access to $1.0 billion available through our “at-the-market” equity program.  As of Feb. 17, 2025, no shares have been sold through our “at-the-market” equity program.\n55\nTable of Contents\nWe may manage interest-rate risk through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt, Treasury locks and interest-rate swaps.  For additional information on our interest-rate swaps, see Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nCash Management\n - At Dec. 31, 2024, we had $733 million of cash and cash equivalents.  For our wholly owned subsidiaries, we use a centralized cash management program that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned nonguarantor operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purposes of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees.  Our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group.  Our operating subsidiaries participate in this program to the extent they are permitted pursuant to FERC regulations or their operating agreements.  Under the cash management program, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short-term cash surpluses or cash requirements, we provide cash to the subsidiary or the subsidiary provides cash to us.\nIn December 2024, we entered into an agreement to provide revolving unsecured loans to EnLink through a promissory note at an interest rate of 4.85% at Dec. 31, 2024.  This is a floating rate agreement which bears interest at ONEOK’s current short-term borrowing rate plus 0.25%.  At Dec. 31, 2024, we held a promissory note receivable of $510 million, which was eliminated in consolidation.  Interest earned on this agreement was not material.  Following the EnLink Acquisition, completed on Jan. 31, 2025, we effectively terminated this agreement as EnLink operating subsidiaries are wholly owned and now participate in the cash management program described above.\nGuarantees\n - ONEOK, ONEOK Partners, the Intermediate Partnership and Magellan (Obligated Group) have cross guarantees in place for ONEOK’s and ONEOK Partners’ indebtedness.  These guarantees in place for our and ONEOK Partners’ indebtedness are full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute joint and several guarantees to the holders of each series of outstanding securities.  Liabilities under the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness.  The Intermediate Partnership holds all of ONEOK Partners’ interests and equity in its subsidiaries, which are nonguarantors, and substantially all the assets and operations reside with nonguarantor operating subsidiaries.  Magellan holds interests in its subsidiaries, which are nonguarantors, and substantially all the assets and operations reside with nonguarantor operating subsidiaries.  \nAt Dec. 31, 2024, EnLink was a subsidiary of ONEOK, but did not guarantee ONEOK’s or ONEOK Partners’ indebtedness and was excluded from the Obligated Group.  EnLink and EnLink Partners also had outstanding debt securities that were not guaranteed by ONEOK as of Dec. 31, 2024.  At the completion of the EnLink Acquisition on Jan. 31, 2025, ONEOK assumed the outstanding debt of EnLink and EnLink Partners (the Assumed Debt) such that EnLink and EnLink Partners were each released from all debt obligations, and provided a guarantee for our and ONEOK Partners’ indebtedness to the holders of each series of outstanding securities, including for the Assumed Debt.  EnLink and EnLink Partners are now included in the Obligated Group.  As of the date of this report, the combined financial information of subsidiary issuers and parent guarantors, excluding our ownership of all interest in ONEOK Partners, Magellan and EnLink, reflect no material assets or liabilities or results of operations, apart from guaranteed indebtedness and therefore, we have excluded the summarized financial information for each issuer and guarantor.  \nFor additional information on our indebtedness, please see Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nShort-term Liquidity\n - Our principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, distributions received from our unconsolidated affiliates, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our recently executed $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement.  In February 2025, we amended and restated our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement to increase the size to $3.5 billion, extend the term to February 2030 and make other non-material modifications.  All other terms and conditions remain substantially the same.  As of Feb. 17, 2025, we had no borrowings under our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, and we are in compliance with all covenants.  Upon closing of the EnLink Acquisition on Jan. 31, 2025, the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility was terminated.  \nWe had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of $481 million and $344 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, and Dec. 31, 2023, respectively, due primarily to current maturities of long-term debt.  Generally, our working capital is influenced by several factors, including, among other things: (i) the timing of (a) debt and equity issuances, (b) the funding of capital expenditures, (c) scheduled debt payments, and (d) accounts receivable and payable; and (ii) the volume and cost of inventory and commodity imbalances.  We may have working capital deficits in future periods as our long-term debt becomes current.  We do not expect a working capital deficit of this nature to have a material adverse impact to our cash flows or operations.\n56\nTable of Contents\nFor additional information on our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, see Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. \nLong-term Financing\n - In addition to our principal sources of short-term liquidity discussed above, we expect to fund our longer-term financing requirements by issuing long-term notes, as needed.  Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuing common stock, loans from financial institutions, issuance of convertible debt securities or preferred equity securities, asset securitization and the sale and lease-back of facilities.\nWe may, at any time, seek to retire or purchase our or ONEOK Partners’ outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.  Such repurchases and exchanges, if any, will be on such terms and prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, or liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.  The amounts involved may be material.\nDebt Issuances\n - In September 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes consisting of senior notes of the following tenors: $1.25 billion, 4.25% senior notes due 2027; $600 million, 4.4% senior notes due 2029; $1.25 billion, 4.75% senior notes due 2031; $1.6 billion, 5.05% senior notes due 2034; $1.5 billion, 5.7% senior notes due 2054; and $800 million, 5.85% senior notes due 2064.  The net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were $6.9 billion.  The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and the Medallion Acquisition, purchase additional interests in a Medallion joint venture owned by a separate third party, to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisitions and to repay outstanding indebtedness.\nDebt Repayments\n - In December 2024, we repaid $120 million of borrowings under the Guardian Term Loan Agreement and $60 million of borrowings under the Viking Term Loan Agreement, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand, as part of the interstate natural gas pipeline divestiture.\nIn December 2024, we redeemed our $500 million, 4.9% senior notes due March 2025 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.\nSubsequent to the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, we repaid $465 million of borrowings under the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility with cash on hand.\nSubsequent to the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, we repaid $374 million of borrowings under the EnLink AR Facility with cash on hand and terminated the EnLink AR Facility. \nIn September 2024, we repaid the remaining $484 million of our $500 million, 2.75% senior notes at maturity with cash on hand.\nEquity\n - On Jan. 31, 2025, we completed the EnLink Acquisition.  Pursuant to the EnLink Merger Agreement, each common unit of EnLink was exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.1412 shares of ONEOK Common stock, including EnLink Units that were exchanged for all previously outstanding Series B Preferred Units immediately prior to closing.  We issued 41 million shares of common stock, with a fair value of $4.0 billion.  There are no remaining Series B Preferred Units outstanding.\nOn Oct. 17, 2024, EnLink redeemed all outstanding Series C Preferred Units at $1,000 per Series C Preferred Unit, plus $8.28 per Series C Preferred Unit of unpaid distributions, for $365 million with proceeds received from borrowings under the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility.  As of Dec. 31. 2024, there are no remaining Series C Preferred Units outstanding. \nShare Repurchase Program\n - In January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock.  We expect shares to be acquired from time to time in open-market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors.  As of Feb. 17, 2025, we have repurchased 1.675 million shares for $172 million under the program with cash on hand.  The program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $2.0 billion of common stock or on Jan. 1, 2029, whichever occurs first. \nMaterial Commitments\n - We have material cash commitments related to our capital expenditures, senior notes and corresponding interest payments, which we expect to fund through our sources of cash inflows discussed above.  Our senior notes and interest payments are discussed in Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  We also have cash commitments related to transportation, storage and other commercial contracts, as well as our financial and physical derivative obligations, which we expect to fund with cash from operations.\n57\nTable of Contents\nCapital Expenditures\n \n- We proactively monitor lead times on materials and equipment used in constructing capital projects, and we enter into procurement agreements for long-lead items for potential projects to plan for future growth.  Our capital expenditures are financed typically through operating cash flows and short- and long-term debt.\nThe following table sets forth our capital expenditures, excluding the equity portion of AFUDC, for the periods indicated:\nCapital Expenditures\n2024 (a)\n2023\n2022\n \n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing\n$\n492\n \n$\n448 \n$\n445 \nNatural Gas Liquids\n987\n \n818 \n581 \nNatural Gas Pipelines\n258\n \n228 \n123 \nRefined Products and Crude (b)\n216\n \n52 \n— \nOther\n68\n \n49 \n53 \nTotal capital expenditures\n$\n2,021\n \n$\n1,595 \n$\n1,202 \n(a) \n- \nIncludes capital expenditures for EnLink and Medallion for the period Oct. 15, 2024, and Nov. 1, 2024, through Dec. 31, 2024, respectively.\n(b) - The year ended Dec. 31, 2023, includes capital expenditures for the period Sept. 25, 2023, through Dec. 31, 2023.\nCapital expenditures increased in 2024, compared with 2023, due primarily to our capital projects, including our MB-6 fractionator and the NGL and Refined Products and Crude pipeline expansion projects.  See discussion of our announced capital projects in the “Recent Developments” section. \nWe expect total capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC and capitalized interest, of $2.8 - $3.2 billion in 2025. \nCredit Ratings\n - Our long-term debt credit ratings as of Feb. 17, 2025, are shown in the table below:\nRating Agency\nLong-Term Rating\nShort-Term Rating\nOutlook\nMoody’s\nBaa2\nPrime-2\nStable\nS&P\nBBB\nA-2\nStable\nFitch\nBBB\nF2\nStable\nOur credit ratings, which are investment grade, may be affected by our leverage, liquidity, credit profile or potential transactions.  The most common criteria for assessment of our credit ratings are the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, interest coverage, business risk profile and liquidity.  If our credit ratings were downgraded, our cost to borrow funds under our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement would increase, and a potential loss of access to the commercial paper market could occur.  In the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we would continue to have access to our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, which expires in 2030.  An adverse credit rating change alone is not a default under our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement.\nIn the normal course of business, our counterparties provide us with secured and unsecured credit.  In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings or a significant change in our counterparties’ evaluation of our creditworthiness, we could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing to conduct business with such counterparties.  We may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments.\nDividends\n - Holders of our common stock share equally in any common stock dividends declared by our Board of Directors, subject to the rights of the holders of outstanding preferred stock.  In 2024, we paid common stock dividends totaling $3.96 per share, an increase of 3.7% compared to the 2023 dividend of $3.82 per share.  In February 2025, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.03 per share ($4.12 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 4% compared with the same quarter in the prior year.\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, our cash flows from operations exceeded dividends paid by $2.6 billion.  We expect our cash flows from operations to continue to sufficiently fund our cash dividends.  To the extent operating cash flows are not sufficient to fund our dividends, we may utilize cash on hand from other sources of short- and long-term liquidity to fund a portion of our dividends.\n58\nTable of Contents\nCASH FLOW ANALYSIS\nWe use the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that affect net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period and for operating cash items that do not impact net income.  These reconciling items can include depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, impairment charges, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain or loss on sale of business and assets, net undistributed earnings from equity-method investments, share-based compensation expense, other amounts and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities.\nThe following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:\n \nYears Ended Dec. 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\n \n \nOperating activities\n$\n4,888\n \n$\n4,421 \n$\n2,906 \nInvesting activities\n(6,612)\n(6,404)\n(1,139)\nFinancing activities\n2,119\n \n2,101 \n(1,693)\nChange in cash and cash equivalents\n395\n \n118 \n74 \nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n338\n \n220 \n146 \nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$\n733\n \n$\n338 \n$\n220 \nOperating Cash Flows\n - Operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.  Changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in supply, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows.  Our operating cash flows can also be impacted by changes in our inventory balances, which are driven primarily by commodity prices, supply, demand and the operation of our assets.\n2024 vs. 2023\n - Cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased $868 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, due primarily to the impact of the Magellan Acquisition in our Refined Products and Crude segment, as discussed in “Financial Results and Operating Information” offset partially by insurance proceeds received from the Medford settlement in 2023.  \nThe changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows $43 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, compared with an increase of $358 million for the same period in 2023.  This change is due primarily to changes in our legal reserve liability as discussed in Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report, changes in risk management assets and liabilities and changes in accounts receivable resulting from the receipts of cash from counterparties and from inventory, both of which varies from period to period, and with changes in commodity prices.  These changes were offset partially by changes in accounts payable, which vary from period to period with changes in commodity prices and from the timing of payments to vendors, suppliers and other third parties.\nInvesting Cash Flows \n2024 vs. 2023\n - Cash used in investing activities for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, increased $208 million, compared with the same period in 2023, due primarily to cash paid to acquire EnLink and Medallion, capital expenditures related to our capital projects in 2024 and insurance proceeds received from the Medford settlement in 2023, offset partially by proceeds received from the interstate natural gas pipeline divestiture.\nFinancing Cash Flows \n2024 vs. 2023\n - Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, increased $18 million compared with the same period in 2023, due primarily to the increase in issuance of senior unsecured notes associated with acquisitions, offset by increased repayments of long-term debt in 2024, including the repayment of the Viking and Guardian Term Loan Agreements and the outstanding borrowings on the EnLink Revolving Credit facility and the EnLink AR Facility, increased dividends paid in 2024 and the repurchase of EnLink’s Series C Preferred Units. \n59\nTable of Contents\nCash Flow Analysis for the Year Ended Dec. 31, 2023 vs. 2022\n - The cash flow analysis for the year ended Dec. 31, 2023, compared with the year ended Dec. 31, 2022, is included in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available via the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our website at www.oneok.com.\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nInformation about the impact of new accounting standards is included in Note A\n \nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates.\nThe following is a summary of our most critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those estimates most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters.  We have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  See Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for the description of our accounting policies.\nFair Value Estimates in Business Combination Accounting\n - Business combination accounting requires that assets and liabilities be recorded at their estimated fair value in connection with the initial recognition of the transaction.  Estimating the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with business combination accounting requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments, and in some cases management may also utilize third-party specialists to assist and advise on those estimates.\nIn order to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we utilized widely accepted valuation techniques that included discounted cash flow and cost methods.  The discounted cash flow method utilizes assumptions that include, but are not limited to, estimated future cash flows, commodity margin growth rates, discount rates applied to estimated future cash flows, estimated rates of return and estimated customer attrition rates.  Cost methods estimate the fair value of assets based on the estimated construction or replacement cost of the assets and requires the use of various inputs and assumptions.  While we believe we have made reasonable assumptions to estimate the fair value, these assumptions are inherently uncertain.  An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in our assumptions is not practicable given the numerous assumptions, and their interdependence, that can materially affect our estimates.\nThe purchase price allocation recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available. \nSee Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of business combinations. \nDerivatives and Risk-management Activities\n - We utilize derivatives to reduce our market-risk exposure to commodity price and interest-rate fluctuations and to achieve more predictable cash flows.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship.  When possible, we implement effective hedging strategies using derivative financial instruments that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes.  We have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes.  For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss from a change in fair value of the derivative instrument is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which time the fair value of the derivative instrument is reclassified into earnings. \nWe assess hedging relationships at the inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter, to determine whether the hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly effective.  We do not believe that changes in our fair value estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of operations, as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for \n60\nTable of Contents\nas effective cash flow hedges.  However, if a derivative instrument is ineligible for cash flow hedge accounting or if we fail to appropriately designate it as a cash flow hedge, changes in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recorded currently in earnings.  Additionally, if a cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recognized in earnings.  For more information on commodity price sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nSee Notes A, D and E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of fair value measurements and derivatives and risk-management activities.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Equity Method Investments\n - We assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually as of July 1, unless events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred before that time.  As part of our goodwill impairment test, we may first assess qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount.  If further testing is necessary, or a quantitative test is elected, we perform a Step 1 analysis for goodwill impairment.\nIn a Step 1 analysis, an assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  \nWe assess our long-lived asset groups, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group.  If an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset group. \nWe evaluate equity method investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there is an other-than-temporary loss in value of the investment.  When evidence of loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate of fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred.  If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and we consider the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recognized in our consolidated financial statements as an impairment charge.\nOur impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates, such as industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies.  To estimate undiscounted future cash flows of long-lived assets we may apply a probability-weighted approach that incorporates different assumptions and potential outcomes related to the underlying long-lived assets.  The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which separately identifiable cash flows exist.  To estimate the fair value of these assets, we use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach.  Under the income approach, our discounted cash flow analysis includes the following inputs that are not readily available: a discount rate reflective of industry cost of capital, our estimated contract rates, volumes, operating margins, operating and maintenance costs and capital expenditures.  Under the market approach, our inputs include EBITDA multiples, which are estimated from recent peer acquisition transactions, and forecasted EBITDA, which incorporates inputs similar to those used under the income approach.  If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to future impairment charges.\nSee Notes A, F, G and O of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of goodwill and intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates.\nDepreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment\n - Our property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method that incorporates management assumptions regarding useful economic lives and residual values.  As we place additional assets in service or acquire assets as a result of an acquisition or asset purchase, our estimates related to depreciation expense have become more significant and changes in estimated useful lives of our assets could have a material effect on our results of operations.  At the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation expense prospectively.  Examples of such circumstances include changes in (i) competition, (ii) laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (iii) technology that render an asset obsolete, (iv) expected salvage values, (v) results of rate cases or rate settlements on regulated assets and (vi) forecasts of the remaining economic life for the resource basins where our assets are located, if any.  For the fiscal years presented in this Form 10-K, no \n61\nTable of Contents\nchanges were made to the determinations of useful lives that would have a material effect on the timing of depreciation expense in future periods.\nSee Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of property, plant and equipment.\nITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur exposure to market risk, discussed below, includes forward-looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that could occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices within our derivative portfolio.  Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions.\nWe are exposed to market risk due to commodity price and interest-rate volatility.  Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices.  We may use financial instruments, including forward sales, swaps, options and futures, to manage the risks of certain identifiable or anticipated transactions and achieve more predictable cash flows.  Our risk-management function follows policies and procedures established by our Risk Oversight and Strategy Committee to monitor our natural gas, NGL, Refined Products, condensate and crude oil marketing activities and interest rates to ensure our hedging activities mitigate market risks and comply with approved thresholds or limits.  We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes.\nWe utilize a sensitivity analysis model to assess the risk associated with our derivative portfolio.  The sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in fair value of our derivative instruments based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying commodity prices or interest rates.  In addition to these variables, the fair value of our derivative portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values.  Because we enter into these derivative instruments for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities, as described below, the change in the market value of our derivative portfolio would typically be offset largely by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged item.  \nSee Note A\n \nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for a discussion on our accounting policies for our derivative instruments and the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nAs part of our hedging strategy, we use commodity derivative financial instruments and physical-forward contracts described in Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report to reduce the impact of near-term price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products, condensate and crude oil. \nThe following table presents the effect a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying commodity prices would have on the estimated fair value of our commodity derivative instruments as of the dates indicated:\nCommodity Contracts\nDec.  31,\n2024\nDec.  31,\n2023\n \n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\nRefined Products, crude oil and NGLs\n$\n61\n \n$\n67 \nNatural gas\n9\n \n5 \nTotal change in estimated fair value of commodity contracts\n$\n70\n \n$\n72 \nOur sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on our commodity derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market prices and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur.  Actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market prices, as well as changes in our commodity derivative portfolio during the year.\nINTEREST-RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to interest-rate risk through borrowings under our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, commercial paper program and long-term debt issuances.  Future increases in commercial paper rates or bond rates could expose us to increased interest \n62\nTable of Contents\ncosts on future borrowings.  We may manage interest-rate risk through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt, Treasury locks and interest-rate swaps. \nTreasury locks are agreements to pay the difference between the benchmark Treasury rate and the rate that is designated in the terms of the agreement.  In the third quarter of 2024, we entered into $1.5 billion of Treasury locks \nto hedge the variability of interest payments on a portion of our forecasted debt issuances.  In the same quarter, we settled all of our $1.5 billion Treasury locks related to our underwritten public offering of $7.0 billion senior unsecured notes associated with the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and Medallion Acquisition.  All of our Treasury locks were designated as cash flow hedges. \n At Dec. 31, 2024, and Dec. 31, 2023, we had no outstanding Treasury lock agreements.\nInterest-rate swaps are agreements to exchange interest payments at some future point based on specified notional amounts.  EnLink previously entered into $400 million interest rate swaps associated with the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility and the EnLink AR Facility.  In December 2024, EnLink terminated the $400 million interest rate swaps upon repayment of outstanding amounts under the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility and termination of the EnLink AR Facility.  \nAt \nDec. 31, 2024, and Dec. 31, 2023, we had no outstanding interest-rate swap agreements.\nSee Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information on our hedging activities.\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK\nWe assess the creditworthiness of our counterparties on an ongoing basis and require security, including prepayments, letters of credit, liens and other forms of collateral, when appropriate.  Certain of our counterparties may be impacted by a relatively low commodity price environment and could experience financial problems, which could result in nonpayment and/or nonperformance, which could impact adversely our results of operations.  As a result of our recent acquisitions, we now transact with the counterparties of EnLink and Medallion.  A substantial portion of EnLink and Medallion counterparties are rated investment-grade by S&P or provide a letter of credit or other collateral. \nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing\n - Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment derives fees for services primarily from major and independent crude oil and natural gas producers, which include both large integrated and independent exploration and production companies.  In this segment, our downstream commodity sales customers are primarily utilities, large industrial companies, marketing companies and our NGL affiliate.  We are not typically exposed to material credit risk with producers under fee with POP contracts as we sell the commodities and remit a portion of the sales proceeds back to the producer less our contractual fees.  In 2024, excluding EnLink, and 2023, approximately 85% and 90%, respectively, of the downstream commodity sales in our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment were made to customers rated investment-grade by S&P, approved through comparable internal counterparty analysis or were secured by letters of credit or other collateral. \nNatural Gas Liquids\n - Our Natural Gas Liquids segment’s counterparties are primarily NGL and natural gas gathering and processing companies; major and independent crude oil and natural gas production companies; utilities; large industrial companies; natural gasoline distributors; propane distributors; municipalities; and petrochemical, refining and marketing companies.  We charge fees to NGL and natural gas gathering and processing counterparties and NGL pipeline transportation customers.  We are not typically exposed to material credit risk on the majority of our exchange services fees, as we purchase NGLs from our gathering and processing counterparties and deduct our fee from the amounts we remit.  We also earn sales revenue on the downstream sales of Purity NGLs.  In 2024, excluding EnLink, and 2023, approximately 90% and 85%, respectively of this segment’s commodity sales were made to customers rated investment-grade by S&P, approved through comparable internal counterparty analysis or were secured by letters of credit or other collateral.  In addition, the majority of our Natural Gas Liquids segment’s pipeline tariffs provide us the ability to require security from shippers. \nNatural Gas Pipelines\n - Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment’s customers are primarily local natural gas distribution companies, electric-generation facilities, large industrial companies, municipalities, producers, processors and marketing companies.  In 2024, excluding EnLink, and 2023, approximately 90% of our revenues in this segment were from customers rated investment grade by S&P, approved through comparable internal counterparty analysis or were secured by letters of credit or other collateral.  In addition, the majority of our Natural Gas Pipelines segment’s pipeline tariffs provide us the ability to require security from shippers. \nRefined Products and Crude - \nOur Refined Products and Crude segment’s customers include refiners, wholesalers, retailers, traders, railroads, airlines and regional farm cooperatives.  In 2024, excluding EnLink and Medallion, and the fourth quarter of 2023, approximately 70% of our revenues in this segment were from customers rated investment-grade by S&P, approved through comparable internal counterparty analysis or were secured by letters of credit, liens, or other collateral. \n63\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of ONEOK, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ONEOK, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\").  We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded EnLink Midstream, LLC (“EnLink”) and Medallion Midstream, LLC (“Medallion”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2024.  We have also excluded EnLink and Medallion from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. EnLink and Medallion are consolidated subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 20% and 3% of total assets, respectively and approximately 7% and 1% of total revenues, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n64\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAcquisition of EnLink Midstream, LLC – Valuation of Pipelines, Rights-of-Way and Processing Plants\nAs described in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, on October 15, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in EnLink by acquiring GIP’s interest in EnLink consisting of approximately 43% of the outstanding EnLink Units for $14.90 in cash per unit and 100% of the outstanding limited liability company interests in the managing member of EnLink for $300 million, for a total cash consideration of $3.3 billion.  The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $11.4 billion of property, plant and equipment (PP&E), a significant portion of which relates to pipelines, rights-of-way, and processing plants.  The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, which requires, among other things, assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their fair values on the acquisition date.  As disclosed by management, in order to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management utilized valuation techniques that included discounted cash flow and cost methods.  The discounted cash flow method utilizes assumptions that include, but are not limited to, estimated future cash flows, discount rates applied to estimated future cash flows and commodity margin growth rates.  Cost methods estimate the fair value of assets based on the estimated construction or replacement cost of the assets and require the use of various inputs and assumptions.  \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of pipelines, rights-of-way, and processing plants acquired in the acquisition of EnLink is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the pipelines, rights-of-way, and processing plants acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to discount rates and commodity margin growth rates used in the discounted cash flow method and estimated construction or replacement cost used in the cost method; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the pipelines, rights-of-way, and processing plants acquired.  These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the pipelines, rights-of-way, and processing plants acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flows and cost methods used  by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow and cost methods; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to discount rates and commodity margin growth rates used in the discounted cash flow method and the estimated construction or replacement cost used in the cost method.  Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the commodity margin growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of EnLink and (ii) whether the assumptions were \n65\nTable of Contents\nconsistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.  Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow and cost methods and (ii) the reasonableness of the assumptions related to discount rates, commodity margin growth rates, and estimated construction or replacement cost.\ns/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n \nTulsa, Oklahoma\nFebruary 25, 2025\nWe have served as the

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA.    \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization and Nature of Operations\n - We are a corporation incorporated under the laws of the state of Oklahoma.\nOur Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment provides midstream services to producers in the Rocky Mountain region, the Mid-Continent region, the Permian Basin region and the the North Texas region.  Raw natural gas is typically gathered at the wellhead, compressed and transported through pipelines to our processing facilities.  Most raw natural gas produced at the wellhead also contains a mixture of NGL components, including ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  Gathered wellhead natural gas is directed to our processing plants to remove NGLs, resulting in residue natural gas (primarily methane).  Residue natural gas is then recompressed and delivered to natural gas pipelines, storage facilities and end users.  The NGLs separated from the raw natural gas are delivered through NGL pipelines to fractionation facilities for further processing. \nIn our Natural Gas Liquids segment, NGLs are extracted at our own and third-party natural gas processing plants and are gathered by our NGL gathering pipelines.  Gathered NGLs are directed to our downstream fractionators to be separated into Purity NGLs.  Purity NGLs are stored or distributed to our customers, such as petrochemical companies, propane distributors, diluent users, ethanol producers, refineries and exporters.  We provide midstream services to producers of NGLs in the Rocky Mountain region, Mid-Continent region, Permian Basin and Gulf Coast region (including Louisiana) and deliver those products to the market.  Our primary markets include the Mid-Continent in Conway, Kansas, the Gulf Coast in Mont Belvieu, Texas, Louisiana and the upper Midwest.  The majority of the pipeline-connected natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin, Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas Panhandle as well as a large number in the Permian Basin, Barnett Shale, East Texas and Louisiana regions are connected to our NGL gathering systems. \nIn our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we receive residue natural gas from third parties and our own natural gas processing plants and interconnecting pipelines.  Residue natural gas is transported or stored for end users, such as large industrial customers, natural gas and electric utilities serving commercial and residential consumers and can ultimately reach international markets through liquified natural gas exports (Louisiana Gulf Coast) and cross border pipelines.  Our assets are connected to key supply areas and demand centers, including export markets in Mexico via Roadrunner and supply areas in Canada and the United States via our interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines and Northern Border, which enables us to provide essential natural gas transportation and storage services.  Growing demand from data centers and continued demand from local distribution companies, electric-generation facilities and large industrial companies support low-cost expansions that position us well to provide additional services to our customers when needed. \nOur Refined Products and Crude segment is principally engaged in the transportation, storage and distribution of Refined Products and crude oil.  As a result of the EnLink Acquisitions and the Medallion Acquisition, we are also engaged in the gathering of crude oil\n.  \nCrude oil pipelines gather and transport crude oil to refineries, export facilities and demand centers.  Throughout our distribution system, terminals play a key role in facilitating product movements and marketing by providing storage, distribution, blending and other ancillary services.  Products transported on our Refined Products pipeline system include gasoline, distillates, aviation fuel and certain NGLs.  Shipments originate on our Refined Products pipeline system from direct connections to refineries or through interconnections with other pipelines or terminals for transportation and ultimate distribution to retail fueling stations, convenience stores, travel centers, railroads, airports and other end users.  \nBasis of Presentation\n - Our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  These statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n \nConsolidation\n - Our Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries over which we have control or are the primary beneficiary.  Third party ownership interests in our controlled subsidiaries are presented as noncontrolling interests.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe account for investments where we control the investment using the consolidation method of accounting.  Under this method, we consolidate all assets and liabilities of an investment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record noncontrolling interests for the portion of the investment we do not own.  We include all of the investment’s results of operations on our Consolidated Statement of Income and record income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the portion of the investment that we do not own.  Our noncontrolling interests for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, are composed of approximately \n57\n% of outstanding EnLink Units we did not own, Series B Preferred Units and the partially owned consolidated subsidiaries of EnLink.  \n71\nTable of Contents\nSee Note I for disclosures of our noncontrolling interests.\nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of our investee.  Under this method, an investment is carried at its acquisition cost and adjusted each period for contributions made, distributions received and our share of the investee’s comprehensive income.  The difference between the carrying value of an investment and our share of the investment’s underlying equity in net assets is referred to as a basis difference.  Basis differences related to depreciable or amortizable assets are amortized through equity in net earnings from investments.  The premium or excess cost over underlying fair value of net assets is referred to as equity-method goodwill.  The portion of the basis difference that is attributable to our equity-method goodwill is not amortized.  Impairment of equity investments is recorded when the impairments are other than temporary.  These amounts are recorded as investments in unconsolidated affiliates on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  \nSee Note O for disclosures of our unconsolidated affiliates.\nDistributions paid to us from our unconsolidated affiliates are classified as operating activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows until the cumulative distributions exceed our proportionate share of income from the unconsolidated affiliate since the date of our initial investment.  The amount of cumulative distributions paid to us that exceeds our cumulative proportionate share of income in each period represents a return of investment and is classified as an investing activity on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIE) - \nWe evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership interest to determine if the entity is a VIE. Variable interests are ownership interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE’s assets.  When we conclude that we hold an interest in a VIE, we must determine if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary.  A primary beneficiary is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance.  We consolidate any VIE when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. \nSignificant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a VIE and in evaluating our interest in a VIE.  We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a VIE.  We evaluate our interests in a VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary.  We continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.\nSee Note J for our VIE disclosures.\nUse of Estimates\n - The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Items that may be estimated include, but are not limited to, the economic useful life of assets, fair value of assets, liabilities and equity-method investments, obligations under employee benefit plans, allowance for credit losses, expenses for services received but for which no invoice has been received, provision for income taxes, including any deferred tax valuation allowances, the results of litigation, environmental remediation and various other recorded or disclosed amounts.  In addition, a portion of our revenues and cost of sales and fuel are recorded based on current month prices and estimated volumes.  The estimates are reversed in the following month when we record actual volumes.  \nWe evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable based on the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from the estimates.  Any effects on our financial position or results of operations from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period when the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nFair Value Measurements\n - For our fair value measurements, we utilize market prices, third-party pricing services, present value methods and standard option valuation models to determine the price we would receive from the sale of an asset or the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction at the measurement date.  We measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities consistent with how a market participant would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.\nMost of the contracts in our derivative portfolio are executed in liquid markets where price transparency exists.  Our financial commodity derivatives are primarily settled through a NYMEX or Intercontinental Exchange clearing broker account with daily margin requirements.  We validate our valuation inputs with third-party information and settlement prices from other sources, where available.\n72\nTable of Contents\nWe compute the fair value of our derivative portfolio by discounting the projected future cash flows from our derivative assets and liabilities to present value using interest-rate yields to calculate present-value discount factors derived from the implied forward SOFR yield curve.  The fair value of our forward-starting interest-rate swaps is determined using financial models that incorporate the implied forward SOFR yield curve for the same period as the future interest-rate swap settlements.  We consider current market data in evaluating counterparties’, as well as our own, nonperformance risk, net of collateral, by using counterparty-specific bond yields.  Although we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of the derivative contracts we have executed, the ultimate market prices realized could differ materially from our estimates.\nFair Value Hierarchy\n - At each balance sheet date, we utilize a fair value hierarchy to classify fair value amounts recognized or disclosed in our financial statements based on the observability of inputs used to estimate such fair value.  The levels of the hierarchy are described below:\n•\nLevel 1 - fair value measurements are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical securities in active markets.  These balances are composed predominantly of exchange-traded derivative contracts for natural gas, Refined Products and crude oil.\n•\nLevel 2 - fair value measurements are based on significant observable pricing inputs, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs from third-party pricing services supported with corroborative evidence.  These balances are composed of exchange cleared and over-the-counter derivatives to hedge natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil price risk and over-the-counter interest-rate derivatives.\n•\nLevel 3 - fair value measurements are based on inputs that may include one or more unobservable inputs.\nDetermining the appropriate classification of our fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy requires management’s judgment regarding the degree to which market data is observable or corroborated by observable market data.  We categorize derivatives based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nSee Note D for our fair value measurements disclosures.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n - Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less.\nRevenue Recognition\n - Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  Our payment terms vary by customer and contract type, including requiring payment before products or services are delivered to certain customers.  However, the term between customer prepayments, completion of our performance obligations, invoicing and receipt of payment due is generally not significant.  \nPerformance Obligations and Revenue Sources\n - Revenue sources are disaggregated in Note S and are derived from commodity sales and services revenues, as described below: \nCommodity Sales\n \n(all segments) - We contract to deliver residue natural gas, unfractionated NGLs and/or Purity NGLs, Refined Products, condensate and crude oil to customers at a specified delivery point.  Our sales agreements may be daily or longer-term contracts for a specified volume.  We consider the sale and delivery of each unit of a commodity an individual performance obligation as the customer is expected to control, accept and benefit from each unit individually.  We record revenue when the commodity is delivered to\n \nthe customer as this represents the point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer.  Revenue is recorded based on the contracted selling price, which is generally index-based and settled daily or monthly.  Occasionally, we sell unfractionated NGLs to customers at an index-based price less third-party fractionation costs.  These costs are included as a reduction to commodity sales revenue.  \nServices\nFee with POP contracts with producer take-in-kind rights \n(\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing segment\n) - Under this type of contract, we do not control the stream of unprocessed natural gas that we receive at the wellhead due to the producer’s take-in-kind rights.  We purchase a portion of the raw natural gas stream, charge fees for providing midstream services, which include gathering, treating, compressing and processing our customer’s natural gas.  After performing these services, we return certain commodities to the producer, sell the remaining commodities and remit a portion of the commodity sales proceeds to the producer less our contractual fees.  Our performance obligation begins with delivery of raw natural gas to our system.  This service is treated as one performance obligation that is satisfied over time.  We use the output method based on delivery of product to our system as the measure of progress, as our services are performed simultaneously.\n73\nTable of Contents\nTransportation, exchange and terminal service contracts \n(\nNatural Gas Liquids and Refined Products and Crude segments\n)\n - \nUnder this type of contract, we charge fees for providing midstream services, which may include a bundled combination of one or more of the following services: gathering, transporting, terminalling, fractionation or other ancillary services.  Our performance obligation begins with delivery of product to our system.  These services represent a series of distinct services that are treated as one performance obligation that is satisfied over time.  We use the output method based on delivery of product to our system as the measure of progress, as our services are performed simultaneously.  For transportation services under a tariff on our transportation pipelines, fees are recorded when the product reaches its destination.  We have certain contracts that require counterparties to ship a minimum volume over an agreed-upon time period, which are contracted as minimum dollar or volume commitments.  Revenue pursuant to these take-or-pay contracts is initially deferred and subsequently recognized when the customers utilize their committed volumes or when the likelihood of meeting the minimum volume commitment becomes remote.\nStorage contracts \n(\nNatural Gas Liquids, Refined Products and Crude and Natural Gas Pipelines segments\n) - We reserve a stated storage capacity and inject/withdraw/store commodities for our customer.  As these services represent a stand-ready obligation provided on a daily basis over the life of the agreement, the fixed capacity reservation fees are allocated and evenly recognized in revenue over the contract term.  Capacity reservation fees that vary based on a stated or implied economic index and correspond with the costs to provide our services are recognized in revenue as invoiced to our customers.  We use the output method based on the passage of time to measure satisfaction of the performance obligation associated with our daily stand-ready services.  Other fees are recognized in revenue as those services are provided and are dependent on the volume moved, which is at our customer’s discretion.  \nFirm service transportation contracts \n(\nNatural Gas Pipelines segment\n) - We reserve a stated transportation capacity and transport commodities for our customer.  The capacity reservation and transportation services are considered a bundled service, as we integrate them into one stand-ready obligation provided on a daily basis over the life of the agreement and satisfied over time.  Fixed capacity reservation fees are allocated and evenly recognized in revenue.  Capacity reservation fees that vary based on a stated or implied economic index and correspond with the costs to provide our services are recognized in revenue based on a daily effective fee rate.  If the capacity reservation fees vary solely as a contract feature, contract assets or liabilities are recorded for the difference between the amount recorded in revenue and the amount billed to the customer.  Transportation fees are recognized in revenue as those services are provided and are dependent on the volume transported by our customer, which is at our customer’s discretion.  We use the output method based on the passage of time to measure satisfaction of the performance obligation associated with our daily stand-ready services.\nInterruptible transportation contracts \n(\nNatural Gas Pipelines segment\n) - We agree to transport natural gas on our pipelines between the customer’s specified nominated-receipt and delivery points if capacity is available after satisfying firm transportation service obligations.  The transaction price is based on the transportation fees times the volumes transported.  We use the output method based on delivery of product to the customer to measure satisfaction of the performance obligation.  The total consideration for delivered volumes is recorded in revenue at the time of delivery, when the customer obtains control.\nMany of the contract types described above contain additional fees or charges payable by customers for nonperformance (e.g., minimum volume commitments or product specifications), which are considered to be variable consideration.  These fees and charges are not recorded until it is probable that a significant reversal of the associated revenue will not occur.\nReceivables from Customers \n- Substantially all of the balances in accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at Dec. 31, 2024, relate to customer receivables.  Substantially all of the balances in accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at Dec. 31, 2023, related to customer receivables, excluding the insurance receivable related to the legal proceeding described in Note P. \nSee Note R for our revenue disclosures.\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities\n - Contract assets and contract liabilities are recorded when the amount of revenue recognized from a contract with a customer differs from the amount billed to the customer and recorded in accounts receivable.  Our contract asset balances at the beginning and end of the period primarily relate to our firm service transportation contracts with tiered rates, which are not material.  Our contract liabilities primarily represent deferred revenue on Refined Products and crude transportation contracts and NGL storage contracts for which revenue is recognized over a \none-year\n term, and deferred revenue on contributions in aid of construction received from customers for which revenue is recognized over the contract periods, which range from \none year\n to \n17\n years, contract liabilities are not material.\nCost of Sales and Fuel\n - Cost of sales and fuel primarily includes (i) the cost of purchased commodities, including natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products, condensate and crude oil, (ii) fees incurred for third-party transportation, fractionation and storage of \n74\nTable of Contents\ncommodities, (iii) fuel and power costs incurred to operate our own facilities that gather, process, transport and store commodities, (iv) product gains and losses and (v) an offset from the contractual fees deducted from the cost of purchased commodities under the contract types below:  \nFee with POP contracts with no producer take-in-kind rights (Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment\n) - We purchase raw natural gas and charge contractual fees for providing midstream services, which include gathering, treating, compressing and processing the producer’s natural gas.  After performing these services, we sell the commodities and return a portion of the commodity sales proceeds to the producer less our contractual fees. \nPurchase with fee \n(\nNatural Gas Liquids segment\n) - Under this type of contract, we purchase raw, unfractionated NGLs at an index price and charge fees for providing midstream services, which may include a bundled combination of gathering, transporting and/or fractionation.\n \nOperations and Maintenance\n - Operations and maintenance primarily includes (i) payroll and benefit costs, (ii) third-party costs for operations, maintenance and integrity management, regulatory compliance and environmental and safety, and (iii) other business-related service costs.\nAccounts Receivable\n - Accounts receivable represent valid claims against nonaffiliated customers for products sold or services rendered.  We present accounts receivable net of an allowance for credit losses to reflect the net amount expected to be collected.  We assess the creditworthiness of our counterparties on an ongoing basis and require security, including prepayments and other forms of collateral, when appropriate.  Outstanding customer receivables are reviewed regularly for possible nonpayment indicators, and allowances for credit losses are recorded based upon management’s estimate of collectability, current conditions and supportable forecasts at each balance sheet date.  At Dec. 31, 2024, our allowance for credit losses was not material.\n \nInventory\n - The values of current NGLs, natural gas, Refined Products and crude oil in storage are determined using the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value.  Materials and supplies are valued at average cost.\n \n \nCommodity Imbalances\n - In our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Pipelines segments, commodity imbalances represent amounts payable or receivable for NGL exchange contracts and natural gas pipeline imbalances and are valued at market prices.  Under the majority of our NGL exchange agreements, we physically receive volumes of unfractionated NGLs, including the risk of loss and legal title to such volumes, from the exchange counterparty.  In turn, we deliver Purity NGLs back to the customer and charge gathering, transportation and fractionation fees.  To the extent that the volumes we receive under such agreements differ from those we deliver, we record a net exchange receivable or payable position with the counterparties.  These net exchange receivables and payables are generally settled with movements of Purity NGLs rather than with cash.  Natural gas pipeline imbalances are settled in cash or in-kind, subject to the terms of the pipelines’ tariffs or by agreement.\nIn our Refined Products and Crude segment, commodity imbalances represent differences in product volumes in our pipeline systems and terminals, compared to the volumes of our customers’ inventories, as we do not take legal title to the majority of the products on our pipeline systems and terminals.  To the extent the product volumes differ from the volumes of our customers’ book inventories, we record adjustments to our product inventories.  When product shortages cause a net short inventory position in a product, a liability is recorded based on market prices.  Refined Products and crude oil imbalances are generally settled in-kind through product purchases and sales.\n \nDerivatives and Risk Management\n - We utilize derivatives to reduce our market-risk exposure to commodity price and interest-rate fluctuations and to achieve more predictable cash flows.  We record all derivative instruments at fair value, with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales transactions that are expected to result in physical delivery.  Commodity price and interest-rate volatility may have a significant impact on the fair value of derivative instruments as of a given date.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it.  \n75\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the various ways in which we account for our derivative instruments and the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n \n \nRecognition and Measurement\nAccounting Treatment\nBalance Sheet\n \nIncome Statement\nNormal purchases and\nnormal sales\n-\nFair value not recorded\n-\nChange in fair value not recognized in earnings\nMark-to-market\n-\nRecorded at fair value\n-\nChange in fair value recognized in earnings\nCash flow hedge\n-\nThe gain or loss on the\nderivative instrument is reported initially as a\ncomponent of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n-\nThe gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings\nFair value hedge\n-\nRecorded at fair value\n-\nThe gain or loss on the derivative instrument is\nrecognized in earnings\n \n-\nChange in fair value of the hedged item is\nrecorded as an adjustment to book value\n-\nChange in fair value of the hedged item is\nrecognized in earnings\nTo reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products, condensate and crude oil prices, we periodically enter into futures, forward purchases and sales, options or swap transactions in order to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products, condensate and crude oil.  Treasury locks and interest-rate swaps are used from time to time to manage interest-rate risk.  Under certain conditions, we designate our derivative instruments as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values or cash flows.  We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as risk-management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions, and methods for assessing and testing correlation and hedge effectiveness.  We specifically identify the forecasted transaction that has been designated as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge relationship.  We assess hedging relationships at the inception of the hedge, and periodically thereafter, to determine whether the hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly effective.  We also document our normal purchases and normal sales transactions that we expect to result in physical delivery and that we elect to exempt from derivative accounting treatment.\nThe realized revenues and purchase costs of our derivative instruments not considered held for trading purposes and derivatives that qualify as normal purchases or normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery are reported on a gross basis. \nCash flows from futures, forwards, options and swaps that are accounted for as hedges are included in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nSee Notes D and E for disclosures of our fair value measurements and risk-management and hedging activities, respectively.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n - Our properties are stated at cost, including AFUDC and capitalized interest.  In some cases, the cost of regulated property retired or sold, plus removal costs, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.  Gains and losses from sales or transfers of nonregulated properties or an entire operating unit or system of our regulated properties are recognized in income.  Maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense.\nThe interest portion of AFUDC and capitalized interest represent the cost of borrowed funds used to finance construction activities for regulated and nonregulated projects, respectively.  We capitalize interest costs during the construction or upgrade of qualifying assets.  These costs are recorded as a reduction to interest expense.  The equity portion of AFUDC represents the capitalization of the estimated average cost of equity used during the construction of major projects and is recorded in the cost of our regulated properties and as a credit to the allowance for equity funds used during construction.\nOur properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.  Generally, we estimate the useful lives of individual assets or apply depreciation rates to functional groups of property having similar economic lives.  We periodically conduct depreciation studies to assess the economic lives of our assets.  For our regulated assets, these depreciation studies are completed as a part of our rate proceedings or tariff filings, and the changes in economic lives, if applicable, are implemented prospectively as of the approved effective date.  For our nonregulated assets, if it is determined that the estimated economic life changes, the changes are made prospectively.  Changes in the estimated economic lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nProperty, plant and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes construction work in process for capital projects that have not yet been placed in service and therefore are not being depreciated.  Assets are transferred out of construction work in process when they are substantially complete and ready for their intended use.\nSee Note F for our property, plant and equipment disclosures.\n76\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Equity Method Investments\n - We assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually as of July 1, unless events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred before that time.  Our qualitative goodwill impairment analysis performed as of July 1, 2024, did not result in an impairment charge nor did our analysis reflect any reporting units at risk, and subsequent to that date, no event has occurred indicating that the implied fair value of our reporting units are less than the carrying value of their net assets. \nGoodwill\n - As part of our goodwill impairment test, we assess qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance) to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their carrying amount.  If further testing is necessary, or a quantitative test is elected, we perform a Step 1 analysis.  In a Step 1 analysis, an assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nTo estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach, using assumptions consistent with a market participant’s perspective.  Under the income approach, we use anticipated cash flows over a period of years plus a terminal value and discount these amounts to their present value using appropriate discount rates.  The forecasted cash flows are based on probability weighted-average possible future cash flows for a reporting unit over a period of years.  Under the market approach, we apply EBITDA multiples to forecasted EBITDA.  The multiples used are consistent with recent market transactions.\nLong-lived assets\n - We assess our long-lived asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group.  If an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset group. \nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliates\n - The impairment test for equity-method investments considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary.  Therefore, we periodically evaluate the amount at which we carry our equity-method investments to determine whether current events or circumstances warrant adjustments to our carrying values.\nSee Notes F, G and O for our disclosures and related impairment charges related to long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates, respectively.\nLeases\n - We lease certain buildings, warehouses, office space, land and equipment, including pipeline equipment, pipeline capacity, rail cars and information technology equipment.  In addition, as a result of the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, we acquired lessee arrangements that primarily include office space, compression, field equipment and land.  Acquired office space lease arrangements typically include variable lease cost related to utility expenses, which are determined based on our pro-rata share of building expenses each month and are expensed as incurred.  Our lease payments are generally straight-line and the exercise of lease renewal options, which vary in term, is at our sole discretion.  We include renewal periods in a lease term if we are reasonably certain to exercise available renewal options.  Our lease agreements do not include any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.  We apply the short-term policy election, which allows us to exclude from recognition leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.  Our weighted-average discount rates represent the rate implicit in the lease or our incremental borrowing rate for a term equal to the remaining term of the lease.  Our finance lease assets and liabilities are not material.\nOur lessor arrangements primarily include capacity, storage and service contracts and are not material.  \nWe have made an accounting policy election for both our lessee and lessor arrangements to combine lease and non-lease components.  This election is applied to all of our lease arrangements as our non-lease components do not result in significant timing differences in the recognition of rental expenses or income.\n \nRegulation\n - Depending on the specific service provided, our natural gas transmission pipelines, NGL, Refined Products and crude oil pipelines and certain natural gas storage facilities are subject to rate regulation and/or accounting requirements by one or more of the FERC, Oklahoma Corporation Commission, Kansas Corporation Commission, Louisiana Public Service Commission, Railroad Commission of Texas, Wyoming Public Service Commission and Colorado Public Utilities Commission.  Accordingly, portions of our Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Pipelines segments follow the accounting and reporting guidance for regulated operations as defined pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification 980, Regulated Operations.  During the rate-making process for certain of our assets, regulatory \n77\nTable of Contents\nauthorities set the framework for what we can charge customers for our services and establish the manner that our costs are accounted for, including allowing us to defer recognition of certain costs and permitting recovery of the amounts through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred.  Certain examples of types of regulatory guidance include costs for fuel and losses, acquisition costs, contributions in aid of construction, charges for depreciation, and gains or losses on disposition of assets.  This allows us to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery.  Actions by regulatory authorities could have an effect on the amounts we may charge our customers.  Any difference in the amount recoverable and the amount deferred is recorded as income or expense at the time of the regulatory action.  A write-off of regulatory assets and costs not recovered may be required if all or a portion of the regulated operations have rates that are no longer (i) established by independent, third-party regulators and (ii) set at levels that will recover our costs when considering the demand and competition for our services.\nRetirement and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\n - We have a legacy ONEOK defined benefit retirement plan covering certain employees and former employees, as well as \ntwo\n defined benefit pension plans for non-union and union legacy Magellan employees.  We sponsor legacy ONEOK welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees hired prior to 2017 who retire with at least \nfive years\n of service of full-time consecutive service.  We also sponsor the postretirement benefit obligations, which cover certain legacy Magellan employees.  The expense and liability related to these plans is calculated using statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events.  These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, interest credit rating, mortality and employment length.  In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and may result in changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. \nSee Note M for our retirement and other postretirement employee benefits disclosures.\nIncome Taxes\n - Deferred income taxes are provided for the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and carryforward items based on income tax laws and rates existing at the time the temporary differences are expected to reverse.  Generally, the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of the rate change.\nWe utilize a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that is taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  We reflect penalties and interest as part of income tax expense as they become applicable for tax provisions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement attribute.  For all periods presented, we had no uncertain tax positions that required the establishment of a material reserve.  \nWe utilize the “with-and-without” approach for intra-period tax allocation for purposes of allocating total tax expense (or benefit) for the year among the various financial statement components.\nWe file numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns with federal tax authorities of the United States along with the tax authorities of several states.  EnLink Midstream Operating, LP and EnLink Partners are both under federal audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar years ended Dec. 31, 2019, and Dec. 31, 2020, and statute waivers are in place for these years.  At this time, we believe the audits will close without a material impact.  No other ONEOK entity is under any United States federal audits or statute waivers at this time.\n \nSee Note N for our income tax disclosures.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n - Asset retirement obligations represent legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the asset.  Certain of our gathering and processing and pipeline facilities are subject to agreements or regulations that give rise to our asset retirement obligations for removal or other disposition costs associated with retiring the assets in place upon the discontinued use of the assets.  We recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period when it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made.  We are not able to estimate reasonably the fair value of the asset retirement obligations for portions of our assets, primarily certain pipeline assets, because the settlement dates are indeterminable given our expected continued use of the assets with proper maintenance.  We expect our pipeline assets, for which we are unable to estimate reasonably the fair value of the asset retirement obligation, will continue in operation as long as supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil exist.  Based on the widespread use of these products in the medical, transportation, synthetics and agriculture industries, as well as for residential and industrial customers and electric generation, we expect supply and demand to exist for the foreseeable future.\n78\nTable of Contents\nFor assets in which we are able to make an estimate, the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.  The liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense.  If the obligation is settled for an amount other than the carrying amount of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss on settlement. \n The depreciation and accretion\n expense are immaterial to \nour Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContingencies\n - Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities, including contingencies for legal and environmental exposures.  We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be estimated reasonably.  We expense legal fees as incurred and base our legal liability estimates on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution.  Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of a remediation feasibility study.  Our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been material in relation to our financial position or results of operations, and our expenditures related to environmental matters did not have a material effect on earnings or cash flows during 2024, 2023 and 2022.  Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings.\n \nSee Note P for additional discussion of contingencies.\nShare-Based Payments\n - We expense the fair value of share-based payments net of estimated forfeitures.  We estimate forfeiture rates based on historical forfeitures under our share-based payment plans.\nSee Note L for our share-based payments disclosures.\nEarnings per Common Share\n - Basic EPS is calculated based on the daily weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, vested restricted and performance units that have been deferred and share awards deferred under the compensation plan for non-employee directors.  Diluted EPS is calculated based on the daily weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive components.  The dilutive components are calculated based on the dilutive effect for each quarter.  For fiscal-year periods, the dilutive components for each quarter are averaged to arrive at the fiscal year-to-date dilutive component.\nSee Note K for our EPS disclosures.\nSegment Reporting\n - In accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic 280, our chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the chief executive officer, who reviews the financial performance of each of our \nfour\n segments to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing our financial performance as a whole, on a regular basis.  Adjusted EBITDA by segment is the single measure of profit and loss utilized in this evaluation by our chief executive officer and is provided through monthly and quarterly review packages.  Forecasted and actual adjusted EBITDA is used in the evaluation and approval of capital projects.  We believe this financial measure is useful because it and similar measures are used by many companies in our industry as a measurement of financial performance and are commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare financial performance among companies in our industry.  Adjusted EBITDA for each segment is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense, and certain other noncash items.  Following the Magellan Acquisition, we performed a review of our calculation methodology of adjusted EBITDA, and beginning in 2023, we updated our calculation to include adjusted EBITDA related to our unconsolidated affiliates using the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in net earnings from investments.  In prior periods, our calculation included equity in net earnings from investments.  This change resulted in an additional $\n62\n million of adjusted EBITDA in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods.  Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated affiliates is calculated consistently with the definition above and excludes items such as interest, depreciation, income taxes and other noncash items.  Although the amounts related to our unconsolidated affiliates are included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, such inclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues, expenses or cash flows of such unconsolidated affiliates.  This calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSee Note S for our segments disclosures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Update\n - Changes to GAAP are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Update (ASUs) to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs.  ASUs not discussed herein were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or clarifications of ASUs previously issued.  Except as discussed below, there have been no new accounting pronouncements that have become effective or have been issued that are of significance or potential significance to us.\n79\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n, which requires public entities to disclose significant expense categories and amounts for each reportable segment on both an interim and annual basis, consisting of expenses regularly reported to the chief operating decision maker and included in a segment's reported measure of segment profit or loss.  The standard also requires disclosing an amount of other segment items as well as all annual disclosures in interim periods.  ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of this standard did not materially impact us.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific disaggregated information about the reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid.  ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We do not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact us.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nIncome Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\n, which requires public entities to provide disaggregated information for certain types of costs and expenses included in each income statement caption, such as inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization and depletion.  ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on us.\nB.     \nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nEnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition\n - On Oct. 15, 2024, we completed the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, acquiring GIP’s interest in EnLink consisting of approximately \n43\n% of the outstanding EnLink Units for $\n14.90\n in cash per unit and \n100\n% of the outstanding limited liability company interests in the managing member of EnLink for $\n300\n million, for total cash consideration of $\n3.3\n billion.  Through our \n100\n% ownership of the managing member of EnLink, we obtained control of EnLink.  We used a portion of the proceeds from our September 2024 underwritten public offering of $\n7.0\n billion senior unsecured notes to fund this acquisition.  For additional information on our long-term debt, see Note H.  \nEnLink’s operations are principally composed of providing midstream services relating to natural gas, NGLs and crude oil.  The assets of EnLink include approximately \n14,000\n miles of pipeline and rights of way, natural gas processing plants with approximately\n \n3.9\n Bcf/d\n of processing capacity, NGL fractionators with approximately \n235\n MBbl/d of operating capacity, barge and rail terminals, product storage facilities, including natural gas storage, purchasing and marketing capabilities and equity investments in certain joint ventures.  EnLink’s operations are now reported across all four of our existing operating segments, allocated by the nature of the commodities and services provided.\nThis acquisition meaningfully increases our scale and integrated value chain within the growing Permian Basin while expanding and extending our asset bases in the Mid-Continent, North Texas and Louisiana regions.  \nWe accounted for this acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations,” which requires, among other things, assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date.  Any excess of consideration to be transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.  Determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments, and in some cases, management may also utilize third-party specialists to assist and advise on those estimates.  The purchase price allocation presented below is substantially complete.  However, management continues to refine the preliminary valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such as working capital liabilities and long-lived assets, and may adjust the allocation in subsequent periods.  The final valuation will be completed as we obtain the information necessary to complete the analysis, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.   \n80\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables set forth the acquisition consideration and preliminary purchase price allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\n At Oct. 15, 2024\n(Millions of dollars and units, except per unit data)\nEnLink Units outstanding\n43\n% of EnLink Units outstanding\n200.3\n \nCash consideration per EnLink unit\n$\n14.90\nCash consideration for EnLink Units\n$\n2,985\n \n100\n% of the outstanding liability company interests in the managing member of EnLink\n300\n \nTotal cash consideration\n$\n3,285\n \nAt Oct. 15, 2024\nAssets acquired:\n(Millions of dollars)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n446\n \nAccounts receivables, net\n548\n \nInventories\n87\n \nOther current assets\n38\n \nProperty, plant and equipment \n11,396\n \nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliates\n342\n \nIntangible assets \n1,051\n \nOther assets\n131\n \nTotal assets acquired\n14,039\n \nLiabilities assumed:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n756\n \nAccounts payable\n465\n \nOther current liabilities (a)\n525\n \nLong-term debt, excluding current maturities\n4,577\n \nDeferred income taxes\n1,988\nOther deferred credits and liabilities\n84\nTotal liabilities assumed\n8,395\nNoncontrolling interests\n5,076\nTotal identifiable net assets\n568\n \nGoodwill \n2,717\n \nTotal purchase price\n$\n3,285\n \n(a) - Includes obligation to repay Series C Preferred Units.  See Note I.\nProperty, plant and equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of pipeline and rights of way, pipeline-related equipment and processing plant and fractionators and will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nIntangible assets:\nThe preliminary value of net identifiable intangible assets relates to customer relationships that will be amortized over the period of expected benefit.\nLong-term debt, excluding current maturities:\nWe utilized publicly traded prices to estimate the fair value. The debt comprises senior unsecured obligations with varying maturities and interest rates as outlined in Note H.  Recognizing the debt at its acquisition date fair value resulted in a discount from the notional value.  The discount was immaterial and will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the debt.  \n81\nTable of Contents\nDeferred income taxes:\nThe EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition resulted in a difference between the carrying value of the underlying assets acquired and the carryover tax basis of assets, which resulted in a deferred tax liability recorded as part of the purchase price allocation.\nGoodwill:\nWe established deferred income tax liabilities resulting from carryover tax basis, which increased goodwill.  The remainder of the goodwill balance primarily represents commercial synergies.  Goodwill will \nnot\n be deductible for tax purposes.  For additional information on goodwill, see Note G.\nNoncontrolling interest:\nRepresents the approximately \n57\n% of EnLink Units not acquired in the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, valued at the acquisition date closing price of EnLink, the Series B Preferred Units and partially owned consolidated subsidiaries. \nResults of operations:\nThe results of operations attributable to the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition through Dec. 31, 2024.  Revenue and income before income taxes attributable to the net assets acquired for the period Oct. 15, 2024, through Dec. 31, 2024, were $\n1.5\n billion and $\n173\n million, respectively.\nSubsequent event\n - On Jan. 31, 2025, we completed the EnLink Acquisition.  Pursuant to the EnLink Merger Agreement, we acquired all of the EnLink outstanding publicly held common units in a fixed ratio exchange of \n0.1412\n shares of ONEOK Common stock, including EnLink Units that were exchanged for all previously outstanding Series B Preferred Units immediately prior to closing.  We issued \n41\n million shares of common stock, with a fair value of $\n4.0\n billion.  EnLink is now a wholly owned subsidiary.  As we controlled EnLink prior to the EnLink Acquisition, the change in our ownership interest was accounted for as an equity transaction.\nMedallion Acquisition\n - On Oct. 31, 2024, we completed the Medallion Acquisition with GIP, acquiring all of the equity interests in Medallion for total cash consideration of $\n2.6\n billion, inclusive of the purchase of additional interests in a Medallion joint venture owned by a separate third party.  We used a portion of the proceeds from our September 2024 underwritten public offering of $\n7.0\n billion senior unsecured notes to fund this acquisition.  For additional information on our long-term debt, see Note H.  \nThis acquisition expands our midstream services for crude oil and condensate in West Texas, specifically the Midland Basin.  The assets of Medallion include crude oil gathering and transportation pipelines and crude oil storage facilities.  Medallion’s assets and operations are reported in our Refined Products and Crude segment.\nWe accounted for this acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations,” which requires, among other things, assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date.  Any excess of consideration to be transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments, and in some cases management may also utilize third-party specialists to assist and advise on those estimates.  The purchase price allocation presented below is substantially complete.  However, management continues to refine the preliminary valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such as working capital liabilities and long-lived assets, and may adjust the allocation in subsequent periods.  The final valuation will be completed as we obtain the information necessary to complete the analysis, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. \n82\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the preliminary purchase price allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nAt Oct. 31, 2024\nAssets acquired:\n(Millions of dollars)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n36\n \nAccounts receivables, net\n114\n \nInventories\n21\n \nOther current assets\n2\n \nProperty, plant and equipment \n1,600\n \nIntangible assets \n730\n \nOther assets\n3\n \nTotal assets acquired\n2,506\n \nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable\n103\n \nOther current liabilities\n5\n \nOther deferred credits and liabilities\n40\nTotal liabilities assumed\n148\nTotal identifiable net assets\n2,358\nGoodwill \n259\n \nTotal purchase price\n$\n2,617\n \nProperty, plant and equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of pipeline and pump station equipment and will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nIntangible assets:\nThe preliminary value of net identifiable intangible assets relates to customer relationships that will be amortized over the period of expected benefit.\nGoodwill:\nGoodwill represents commercial synergies, and is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes.  For additional information on goodwill, see Note G.\nResults of operations:\nThe results of operations attributable to the Medallion Acquisition have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition through Dec. 31, 2024.  Revenue and income before income taxes attributable to the net assets acquired for the period Nov. 1, 2024, through Dec. 31, 2024, were $\n256\n million and $\n43\n million, respectively.\nGulf Coast NGL Pipelines Acquisition\n - On June 17, 2024, we completed the acquisition of a system of NGL pipelines from Easton Energy, a Houston-based midstream company, for approximately $\n280\n million.  This acquisition in our Natural Gas Liquids segment includes approximately \n450\n miles of liquids products pipelines located in the strategic Gulf Coast market centers for NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil.  A portion of the Easton assets are already connected to our Mont Belvieu assets.  We expect to add connections to our Houston-based assets beginning in mid-2025 through the end of 2025.  \nInterstate Natural Gas Pipeline Divestiture\n - On Dec. 31, 2024, we sold \nthree\n of our wholly owned interstate natural gas pipeline systems to DT Midstream, Inc. for total cash consideration of $\n1.2\n billion and recognized a gain of $\n227\n million in other operating income, net, within the Consolidated Statement of Income.  This transaction aligns and enhances our capital allocation priorities within our integrated value chain. These pipeline systems have previously been reported in our Natural Gas Pipelines segment.\nMagellan Acquisition\n - On Sept. 25, 2023, we completed the Magellan Acquisition.  This acquisition strategically diversifies our complementary asset base and allows for significant expected synergies as a combined entity.  Each common unit of Magellan was exchanged for a fixed ratio of \n0.667\n shares of ONEOK common stock and $\n25.00\n of cash, for a total consideration of $\n14.1\n billion.  A total of approximately \n135\n million shares of common stock were issued, with a fair value of approximately $\n9.0\n billion as of the closing date of the Magellan Acquisition.  We funded the cash portion of this acquisition with an underwritten public offering of $\n5.25\n billion senior unsecured notes.  For additional information on our long-term debt, please see Note H.\n83\nTable of Contents\nThe Magellan Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations,” which requires, among other things, assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date.  Determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and the use of independent valuation specialists.\nThe following tables set forth the acquisition consideration and final purchase price allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nSept. 25, 2023\n(Millions of dollars and shares/units, except per share/unit data)\nMagellan public common units outstanding\n202.1\n \nCash consideration per Magellan unit\n$\n25.00\nCash consideration\n$\n5,052\n \nMagellan public common units outstanding\n202.1\n \nONEOK exchange ratio per Magellan unit\n0.667\n \nShares of ONEOK common stock issued\n134.8\n \nONEOK common stock closing price on Sept. 25, 2023\n$\n66.54\nFair value of common stock issued\n$\n8,969\n \nFair value of Magellan replacement equity awards \n93\n \nEquity consideration\n$\n9,062\n \nTotal consideration\n$\n14,114\n \nSept. 25, 2023\nAssets acquired:\n(Millions of dollars)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n37\n \nAccounts receivables, net\n333\n \nInventories\n352\n \nOther current assets\n140\n \nProperty, plant and equipment \n11,644\n \nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliates\n922\n \nIntangible assets \n1,124\n \nOther assets\n121\n \nTotal assets acquired\n14,673\n \nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable\n213\n \nOther current liabilities (a)\n721\n \nLong-term debt, excluding current maturities\n4,013\n \nOther deferred credits and liabilities\n201\nTotal liabilities assumed\n5,148\nTotal identifiable net assets\n9,525\nGoodwill \n4,589\n \nTotal purchase price\n$\n14,114\n \n(a) - Includes contingent liabilities, primarily related to the amounts accrued for the Corpus Christi matter described in Note P.\n \nIn 2024, we recorded adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation that resulted in an increase to goodwill of $\n165\n million due to additional information received during the measurement period.  The adjustment is due primarily to a decrease in property, plant and equipment of approximately $\n100\n million, and an increase to certain contingencies that existed as of the acquisition date.\nProperty, plant and equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of pipeline, pipeline-related equipment, storage tanks and processing equipment and will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n84\nTable of Contents\nIntangible assets:\nThe preliminary value of net identifiable intangible assets relates to customer relationships that will be amortized over the period of expected benefit.\nLong-term debt, excluding current maturities:\nWe assumed the outstanding debt of Magellan and utilized publicly traded prices to estimate the fair value. The debt comprises senior unsecured obligations with varying maturities and interest rates as outlined in Note H.  Recognizing the debt at its acquisition date fair value resulted in a discount from the notional value.  The discount will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the debt.  \nGoodwill:\nGoodwill primarily represents expected tax benefits from future depreciation and amortization of acquired assets\n \nand commercial synergies, and is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes.  For additional information on goodwill, see Note G.\nTransaction Costs\n - \nThe following table sets forth the impact of acquisition related transaction costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income as of the periods indicated:\nYears Ended\nDec. 31,\n \n2024 (a)\n2023 (b)\n \n(Millions of dollars)\nTransaction costs\n$\n73\n \n$\n158\n \nInterest expense\n23\n \n21\n \nTotal\n$\n96\n \n$\n179\n \n(a) - Primarily non-recurring costs related to advisory fees and bridge commitment fees associated with the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and Medallion Acquisition.\n(b) - Primarily non-recurring costs related to advisory fees, severance and settlement of share based awards for certain Magellan employees and integrations costs, as well as bridge facility commitment fees associated with the Magellan Acquisition.\nPro Forma Financial Information (unaudited)\nThe following table sets forth the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information for the years ended Dec. 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, as if we had completed the Magellan Acquisition on Jan. 1, 2022, and the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and the Medallion Acquisition on Jan. 1, 2023:\nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2024\nPro Forma\nEnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition\nPro Forma Medallion Acquisition\nPro Forma Combined\n \nAs reported\n \n(Millions of dollars)\nRevenues\n$\n21,698\n \n$\n4,891\n \n$\n1,078\n \n$\n27,667\n \nNet income\n$\n3,112\n \n$\n288\n \n$\n81\n \n$\n3,481\n \nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2023\nPro Forma EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition\nPro Forma Medallion Acquisition\nPro Forma Magellan Acquisition\nPro Forma Combined\n \nAs reported\n \n(Millions of dollars)\nRevenues\n$\n17,677\n \n$\n6,671\n \n$\n947\n \n$\n2,322\n \n$\n27,617\n \nNet income\n$\n2,659\n \n$\n383\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\n$\n232\n \n$\n3,258\n \nThe summarized unaudited pro forma information reflects the following adjustments:\n•\nReflects depreciation and amortization based on the preliminary fair values of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets;\n85\nTable of Contents\n•\nReflects non-recurring transaction costs incurred presented above that were reclassified and included in pro forma net income as if they had been incurred as of the earliest period presented for each respective acquisition;\n•\nReflects interest expense related to the underwritten public offerings of senior unsecured notes used to fund the cash consideration and other costs related to the acquisitions;\n•\nReflects the amortization of excess fair value of Magellan and EnLink share-based awards;\n•\nReflects the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments;\n•\nReflects the elimination of historical activity between ONEOK, EnLink and Medallion.\nC.    \nMEDFORD INCIDENT\nIn 2022, a fire occurred at our 210 MBbl/d Medford, Oklahoma, NGL fractionation facility.  In the first quarter of 2023, we reached an agreement with our insurers to settle all claims for physical damage and business interruption related to the Medford incident.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we agreed to resolve the claims for total insurance payments of $\n930\n million, $\n100\n million of which was received in 2022.  The remaining $\n830\n million was received in the first quarter of 2023.  The proceeds serve as settlement for property damage, business interruption claims to the date of the settlement and as payment in lieu of future business interruption insurance claims.  We applied the $\n830\n million received to our outstanding insurance receivable at Dec. 31, 2022, of $\n51\n million, and recorded an operational gain for the remaining $\n779\n million in other operating income, net, within the Consolidated Statement of Income.  We classified proceeds received within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows based on our assessment of the nature of the loss (property and business interruption) included in the settlement.\nD.    \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\n - \nThe following tables set forth our recurring fair value measurements as of the dates indicated:\n \nDec. 31, 2024\n \nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal - Gross\nNetting (a)\nTotal - Net\n \n(Millions of dollars\n)\nDerivative assets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Commodity contracts\n$\n41\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n(\n72\n)\n$\n3\n \nTotal derivative assets\n$\n41\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n(\n72\n)\n$\n3\n \nDerivative liabilities\n Commodity contracts\n$\n(\n40\n)\n$\n(\n46\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n86\n)\n$\n81\n \n$\n(\n5\n)\nTotal derivative liabilities\n$\n(\n40\n)\n$\n(\n46\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n86\n)\n$\n81\n \n$\n(\n5\n)\n(a) - Derivative assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis.

At Dec. 31, 2023, we posted \nno\n cash and held cash of $\n41\n million with various counterparties, which offsets our derivative net asset position under master-netting arrangements as shown in the table above.\n86\nTable of Contents\nOther Financial Instruments\n - The approximate fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings is equal to book value due to the short-term nature of these items.  Our cash and cash equivalents are composed of bank and money market accounts and are classified as Level 1.  Our short-term borrowings are classified as Level 2 since the estimated fair value of the short-term borrowings can be determined using information available in the commercial paper market.  We have investments associated with our supplemental executive retirement plan and nonqualified deferred compensation plan that are carried at fair value and primarily are composed of mutual funds, municipal bonds and other fixed income securities classified as Level 1 and Level 2. \nThe estimated fair value of our consolidated long-term debt, including current maturities, was $\n30.8\n billion and $\n21.4\n billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The book value of our consolidated long-term debt, including current maturities, was $\n32.1\n billion and $\n21.7\n billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The estimated fair value of the aggregate senior notes outstanding was determined using quoted market prices for similar issues with similar terms and maturities.  The estimated fair value of our consolidated long-term debt is classified as Level 2.\nE.    \nRISK-MANAGEMENT AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES USING DERIVATIVES\nRisk-management Activities\n - We are sensitive to changes in the prices of natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil, principally as a result of contractual terms under which these commodities are processed, purchased and sold.  We are also subject to the risk of interest-rate fluctuation in the normal course of business.  We use physical-forward purchases and sales and financial derivatives to secure a certain price for a portion of our natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products, condensate and crude oil purchases and sales; to reduce our exposure to commodity price and interest-rate fluctuations; and to achieve more predictable cash flows.  Additionally, we may use physical-forward purchases and financial derivatives to reduce commodity price risk associated with power and natural gas used to operate our facilities.  We follow established policies and procedures to assess risk and approve, monitor and report our risk-management activities.  We have not used these instruments for trading purposes.\nCommodity price risk\n - Commodity price risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in the price of natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil.  We may use the following commodity derivative instruments to reduce the near-term commodity price risk associated with a portion of our forecasted purchases and sales of these commodities:\n•\nFutures contracts\n - Standardized contracts to purchase or sell natural gas and crude oil for future delivery or settlement under the provisions of exchange regulations;\n•\nForward contracts\n - Nonstandardized commitments between two parties to purchase or sell natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products, condensate and crude oil for future physical delivery.  These contracts are typically nontransferable and can only be canceled with the consent of both parties;\n•\nSwaps\n - Exchange of one or more payments based on the value of one or more commodities.  These instruments transfer the financial risk associated with a future change in value between the counterparties of the transaction, without also conveying ownership interest in the asset or liability;\n•\nOptions\n - Contractual agreements that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a fixed quantity of a commodity at a fixed price within a specified period of time.  Options may either be standardized and exchange-traded or customized and nonexchange-traded; and\n•\nCollars\n - Combination of a purchased put option and a sold call option, which places a floor and ceiling price for commodity sales being hedged.\nWe may also use other instruments to mitigate commodity price risk.\nIn our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, we are exposed to commodity price risk as a result of retaining a portion of the commodity sales proceeds associated with our fee with POP contracts.  Under certain fee with POP contracts, our fees and POP percentage may increase or decrease if production volumes, delivery pressures or commodity prices change relative to specified thresholds.  We also are exposed to basis risk between the various production and market locations where we buy and sell commodities.  As part of our hedging strategy, we use the previously described commodity derivative financial instruments and physical-forward contracts to reduce the impact of price fluctuations related to natural gas, NGLs and condensate.\nIn our Natural Gas Liquids segment, we are primarily exposed to commodity price risk resulting from the relative values of the various Purity NGLs to each other, the value of NGLs in storage and the relative value of NGLs to natural gas.  We are also exposed to location price differential risk as a result of the relative value of NGL purchases at one location and sales at another location, primarily related to our optimization and marketing business.  As part of our hedging strategy, we utilize physical-forward contracts and commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of price fluctuations related to NGLs.  \n87\nTable of Contents\nIn our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we are primarily exposed to commodity price risk on our intrastate pipelines because they consume natural gas in operations and retain natural gas from our customers for operations or as part of our fee for compression services provided.  When the amount consumed in operations differs from the amount provided by our customers, our pipelines must buy or sell natural gas, or store or use natural gas inventory, which can expose this segment to commodity price risk depending on the regulatory treatment for this activity.  To the extent that commodity price risk in our Natural Gas Pipelines segment is not mitigated by fuel cost-recovery mechanisms, we may use physical-forward sales or purchases to reduce the impact of natural gas price fluctuations.  At Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no financial derivative instruments with respect to our natural gas pipeline operations.\nIn our Refined Products and Crude segment, we are primarily exposed to commodity price risk from our liquids blending and marketing activities, as well as product retained during the operations of our pipelines and terminals.  As part of our hedging strategy, we use the previously described commodity derivative financial instruments and physical-forward contracts to reduce the impact of price fluctuations related to NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil.\nInterest-rate risk\n - We may manage interest-rate risk through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt, Treasury locks and interest-rate swaps.  Treasury locks are agreements to pay the difference between the benchmark Treasury rate and the rate that is designated in the terms of the agreement.  In the third quarter of 2024, we entered into $\n1.5\n billion of Treasury locks \nto hedge the variability of interest payments on a portion of our forecasted debt issuances.  In the same quarter, we settled all of our $\n1.5\n billion Treasury locks related to our underwritten public offering of $\n7.0\n billion senior unsecured notes associated with the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and Medallion Acquisition.  All of our Treasury locks were designated as cash flow hedges.

We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe minimize credit risk.  These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties’ financial condition (including credit ratings, bond yields and credit default swap rates), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of \n89\nTable of Contents\nstandardized master-netting agreements that allow us to net the positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.  We use internally developed credit ratings for counterparties that do not have a credit rating.\nOur financial commodity derivatives are primarily settled through a NYMEX or Intercontinental Exchange clearing broker account with daily margin requirements.  However, we may enter into financial derivative instruments that contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment-grade credit rating from S&P, Fitch and/or Moody’s.  If our credit ratings on our senior unsecured long-term debt were to decline below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions.  \nThe counterparties to our derivative contracts typically consist of major energy companies, financial institutions and commercial and industrial end users.  This concentration of counterparties may affect our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the counterparties may be affected similarly by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.  Based on our policies, exposures, credit and other reserves, we do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty nonperformance.\nAt Dec. 31, 2024, the credit exposure from our derivative assets is with investment-grade companies in the financial services sector.\nF.    \nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following table sets forth our property, plant and equipment by property type, as of the dates indicated:\nEstimated Useful\nLives (Years)\nDec.  31,\n2024\nDec.  31,\n2023\n \n \n(Millions of dollars\n)\nGathering pipelines and related equipment\n5\n to \n40\n$\n11,643\n \n$\n5,077\n \nProcessing and fractionation and related equipment\n3\n to \n40\n12,406\n \n8,591\n \nStorage and related equipment\n5\n to \n54\n3,684\n \n3,330\n \nTransmission pipelines and related equipment\n5\n to \n87\n21,315\n \n18,551\n \nGeneral plant and other\n2\n to \n60\n1,316\n \n1,002\n \nLand\n—\n592\n \n375\n \nConstruction work in process\n—\n1,318\n \n1,528\n \nProperty, plant and equipment\n \n52,274\n \n38,454\n \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n \n(\n6,339\n)\n(\n5,757\n)\nNet property, plant and equipment\n \n$\n45,935\n \n$\n32,697\n \nThe depreciation expense for the years ended Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, was $\n1.1\n billion and $\n736\n million, respectively.\nWe incurred costs for construction work in process that had not been paid at Dec. 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, of $\n179\n million, $\n242\n million and $\n171\n million, respectively.

At Dec. 31, 2024, EnLink was a subsidiary of ONEOK, did not guarantee ONEOK or ONEOK Partners’ indebtedness and was excluded from the Obligated Group.  EnLink and EnLink Partners’ outstanding debt securities presented in the table above were not guaranteed by the Obligated Group as of Dec. 31, 2024.\nSubsequent event\n - At the completion of the EnLink Acquisition on Jan. 31, 2025, ONEOK assumed the outstanding debt of EnLink and EnLink Partners (the Assumed Debt) such that EnLink and EnLink Partners were each released from all debt obligations and provided a guarantee for our and ONEOK Partners’ indebtedness to the holders of each series of outstanding securities, including for the Assumed Debt.  EnLink and EnLink Partners are now included in the Obligated Group. \n$\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement\n - Our $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement is a revolving credit facility and contains certain customary conditions for borrowing, as well as customary financial, affirmative and negative covenants.  Among other things, these covenants include maintaining a ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA, as defined in our $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement, adjusted for all noncash charges and increased for projected EBITDA from certain lender-approved capital expansion projects).  In addition, adjusted EBITDA as defined in our $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement allows inclusion of the trailing 12 months of consolidated adjusted EBITDA of the acquired business.  In May 2024, we entered into an amendment to our $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement that extended the maturity date by \none year\n, from June 2027 to June 2028.  All other terms and conditions of our $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement remain unchanged.  In June 2024, we completed the acquisition of a system of NGL pipelines, which allowed us to elect an acquisition adjustment period under our $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement and, as a result, increased our leverage ratio covenant to \n5.5\n to 1.  In October 2024, we completed the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and Medallion Acquisition, which effectively extended our acquisition adjustment period until the quarter ending June 30, 2025, after which it will decrease to \n5.0\n to 1.\nThe $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement includes a $\n100\n million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $\n200\n million sublimit for swingline loans.  Under the terms of the $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement, we may request up to an aggregate $\n1.0\n billion increase in the size of the facility, upon satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of commitments from new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders.  The $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement contains provisions for an applicable margin rate and an annual facility fee, both of which adjust with changes in our credit ratings.  Borrowings, if any, will accrue at Term SOFR plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings at the time of determination plus an adjustment of \n10\n basis points.  Under our current credit ratings, the applicable margin on any borrowings would be \n110\n basis points.  We are required to pay an annual facility fee equal to the daily amount of aggregate commitments under the $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement times an applicable rate based on our credit rating at the time of determination.  Under our current credit ratings, the applicable rate is \n15\n basis points.  We have the option to request an additional \none-year\n maturity extension, subject to lender approvals.  The $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement also contains various customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in a termination of the lenders’ commitments and the acceleration of all of our obligations thereunder.  As of Dec. 31, \n93\nTable of Contents\n2024, we had no outstanding borrowings, our ratio of consolidated indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA was \n4.0\n to 1, and we were in compliance with all covenants under our $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement.\nSubsequent event\n - In February 2025, we amended and restated our $\n2.5\n Billion Credit Agreement to increase the size to $\n3.5\n billion, extend the term to February 2030 and make other non-material modifications.  All other terms and conditions are substantially the same.\nEnLink Revolving Credit Facility\n - In October 2024, we completed the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and as a result, we acquired the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility.  The EnLink Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in June 2027, is a $\n1.4\n billion unsecured revolving credit facility which includes a $\n500\n million letter of credit subfacility.  \nBorrowings under the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at Term SOFR plus a Term SOFR spread adjustment of \n0.10\n% per annum and an applicable margin (ranging from \n1.125\n% to \n2.00\n%) or the Base Rate (the highest of the federal funds rate plus \n0.50\n%, one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus \n1.0\n% or the administrative agent’s prime rate) plus an applicable margin (ranging from \n0.125\n% to \n1.00\n%).  The EnLink Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants.  As of Dec. 31, 2024, we had \nno\n borrowings outstanding and we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility. \nSubsequent event\n - Upon closing of the EnLink Acquisition on Jan. 31, 2025, the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility was terminated.  \nEnLink AR Facility\n - In October 2024, we completed the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition and as a result, we acquired the $\n500\n million EnLink AR Facility.  In December 2024, EnLink terminated the AR Facility, and we entered into an agreement to provide revolving unsecured loans to EnLink through a promissory note at an interest rate of \n4.85\n% at Dec. 31, 2024.  This is a floating rate agreement, which bears interest at ONEOK’s current short-term borrowing rate plus \n0.25\n%.  At Dec. 31, 2024, we held a promissory note receivable of $\n510\n million, which was eliminated in consolidation.  Interest earned from this agreement was not material.  \nSubsequent Event\n - Upon closing of the EnLink Acquisition on Jan. 31, 2025, we effectively terminated the agreement to provide revolving unsecured loans to EnLink. \nSenior Unsecured Obligations\n - All notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and are structurally subordinate to any of the existing and future debt and other liabilities of any nonguarantor subsidiaries. \nDebt Issuances \n- \nWe completed the following underwritten public offerings for the periods presented:\n2024 (a)\n2023 (b)\n2022 (c)\nCoupon\nInterest\nCoupon\nInterest\nCoupon\nInterest\n(Millions of dollars)\n(Millions of dollars)\n(Millions of dollars)\n3 year note\n$\n1,250\n \n4.25\n%\n$\n750\n \n5.55\n%\n5 year note\n600\n \n4.4\n%\n750\n \n5.65\n%\n7 year note\n1,250\n \n4.75\n%\n500\n \n5.80\n%\n10 year note\n1,600\n \n5.05\n%\n1,500\n \n6.05\n%\n$\n750\n \n6.1\n%\n30 year note\n1,500\n \n5.7\n%\n1,750\n \n6.625\n%\n40 year note\n800\n \n5.85\n%\n$\n7,000\n \n$\n5,250\n \n$\n750\n \n(a) - The net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were $\n6.9\n billion.

The net proceeds were used to fund the cash consideration and other costs related to the Magellan Acquisition.\n(c) - The proceeds were used primarily to repay all outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program.  The remainder was used for general corporate purposes.\nDebt Repayments\n - In December 2024, we redeemed our $\n500\n million, \n4.9\n% senior notes due March 2025 at \n100\n% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand. \n94\nTable of Contents\nIn December 2024, we repaid $\n120\n million of borrowings under the Guardian Term Loan Agreement and $\n60\n million of borrowings under the Viking Term Loan Agreement, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand, as part of the interstate natural gas pipeline divestiture.\nSubsequent to the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, we repaid $\n465\n million of borrowings under the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility with cash on hand.\nSubsequent to the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, we repaid $\n374\n million of borrowings under the EnLink AR Facility with cash on hand and terminated the EnLink AR Facility. \nIn September 2024, we repaid the remaining $\n484\n million of our $\n500\n million, \n2.75\n% senior notes at maturity with cash on hand.\nIn 2023, we repurchased in the open market outstanding principal of certain of our senior notes in the amount of $\n322\n million for an aggregate repurchase price of $\n280\n million, including accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.  In connection with these open market repurchases, we recognized $\n41\n million of net gains on extinguishment of debt, which is included in other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended Dec. 31, 2023. \nIn 2023, we redeemed our $\n500\n million, \n7.5\n% senior notes due September 2023 at \n100\n% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.\nIn 2023, we redeemed our $\n425\n million, \n5.0\n% senior notes due September 2023 at \n100\n% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.\nIn 2022, we redeemed the remaining $\n896\n million of our \n3.375\n% senior notes due October 2022 at \n100\n% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand and short-term borrowings. \nThe aggregate maturities of long-term debt outstanding and interest payments on total debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2024, for the years 2025 through 2029 are shown below:\nSenior\nUnsecured\nObligations\nInterest\nObligations\non Debt\nTotal\n \n(Millions of dollars)\n2025\n$\n1,059\n \n$\n1,708\n \n$\n2,767\n \n2026\n$\n2,491\n \n$\n1,615\n \n$\n4,106\n \n2027\n$\n1,750\n \n$\n1,537\n \n$\n3,287\n \n2028\n$\n2,150\n \n$\n1,435\n \n$\n3,585\n \n2029\n$\n2,513\n \n$\n1,320\n \n$\n3,833\n \n \nCompliance with Debt Covenants\n - As of Dec. 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various debt agreements. \nOther\n - \nWe amortize premiums, discounts and expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt consistent with the terms of the respective debt instrument.\nI.    \nEQUITY\nNoncontrolling Interests\n - In October 2024, we completed the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, acquiring GIP’s interest in EnLink consisting of approximately \n43\n% of the outstanding EnLink Units.  In connection with the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, we recorded noncontrolling interest with a fair value of $\n5.1\n billion representing the approximately \n57\n% of outstanding EnLink Units we did not own, the Series B Preferred Units and partially owned consolidated subsidiaries of EnLink.  \nIncluded within noncontrolling interest are Series B Preferred Units, which were issued under EnLink Partners’ partnership agreement and represent noncontrolling ownership interests in EnLink Partners.  EnLink Partners is a controlled subsidiary of EnLink in which EnLink owns all of the outstanding common units.  Series B Preferred Units are exchangeable for EnLink Units in an amount equal to the number of outstanding Series B Preferred Units multiplied by an exchange ratio of \n1.15\n, subject to certain adjustments.  The exchange is subject to our option to pay cash instead of issuing additional EnLink common units.  \n95\nTable of Contents\nAs of Dec. 31, 2024, $\n515\n million\n \nof noncontrolling interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheet relate to Series B Preferred Units, and there were \n27.4\n million units outstanding.  There were \nno\n Series B Preferred Units converted or redeemed during the ownership period of Oct. 15, 2024 through Dec. 31, 2024.  Distributions made on Series B Preferred Units were not material. \nEnLink owns a \n50.1\n% interest in the Delaware Basin JV, which owns processing facilities located in the Delaware Basin in Texas.  Noncontrolling interest includes the other owner’s minority interest in the Delaware Basin JV.  As of Dec. 31, 2024, $\n684\n million of noncontrolling interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheet relates to the Delaware Basin JV.  The other partially owned consolidated subsidiary of EnLink is not material.   \nSubsequent event\n - On Jan. 31, 2025, we completed the EnLink Acquisition.  Pursuant to the EnLink Merger Agreement, each common unit of EnLink was exchanged for a fixed ratio of \n0.1412\n shares of ONEOK Common stock, including EnLink Units that were exchanged for all previously outstanding Series B Preferred Units immediately prior to closing.  We issued \n41\n million shares of common stock, with a fair value of $\n4.0\n billion.  There are no remaining Series B Preferred Units outstanding.\nSeries A and B Convertible Preferred Stock\n - There are \nno\n shares of Series A or Series B Preferred Stock currently issued or outstanding.\nEnLink Series C Preferred Units\n - Series C Preferred Units represented noncontrolling ownership interests in EnLink Partners.  In September 2024, EnLink gave notice to redeem all of its outstanding Series C Preferred Units, and reclassified the obligation to a liability on their Consolidated Balance Sheet.  On Oct. 17, 2024, EnLink redeemed all outstanding Series C Preferred Units at $\n1,000\n per Series C Preferred Unit, plus $\n8.28\n per Series C Preferred Unit of unpaid distributions, for $\n365\n million with proceeds received from borrowings under the EnLink Revolving Credit Facility.  As of Dec. 31. 2024, there are \nno\n remaining Series C Preferred Units outstanding. \nEquity Issuances\n - In September 2023, we completed the Magellan Acquisition.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each common unit of Magellan was exchanged for a fixed ratio of \n0.667\n shares of ONEOK common stock and $\n25.00\n of cash.  We issued approximately \n135\n million shares of common stock, with a fair value of approximately $\n9.0\n billion as of the closing date of the Magellan Acquisition. \nWe have an “at-the-market” equity program for the offer and sale from time to time of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $\n1.0\n billion.  The program allows us to offer and sell common stock at prices we deem appropriate through a sales agent, in forward sales transactions through a forward seller or directly to one or more of the program’s managers acting as principals.  Sales of our common stock may be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the NYSE, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed to between us and the sales agent.  We are under no obligation to offer and sell common stock under the program.  As of Dec. 31, 2024, \nno\n shares have been sold through our “at-the-market” program. \nShare Repurchase Program\n - In January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to $\n2.0\n billion of our outstanding common stock.  We expect shares to be acquired from time to time in open-market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors.  The program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $\n2.0\n billion of common stock or on Jan. 1, 2029, whichever occurs first.  As of Dec. 31, 2024, we repurchased $\n172\n million of our outstanding common stock under the program, which were funded by cash on hand and short-term borrowings.\nDividends\n - Holders of our common stock share equally in any dividend declared by our Board of Directors, subject to the rights of the holders of outstanding Series E Preferred Stock.  Dividends paid totaled $\n2.3\n billion, $\n1.8\n billion and $\n1.7\n billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nThe following table sets forth the quarterly dividends per share paid on our common stock in the periods indicated:\n \nYears Ended Dec. 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nFirst Quarter\n$\n0.99\n \n$\n0.955\n \n$\n0.935\n \nSecond Quarter\n0.99\n \n0.955\n \n0.935\n \nThird Quarter\n0.99\n \n0.955\n \n0.935\n \nFourth Quarter\n0.99\n \n0.955\n \n0.935\n \nTotal\n$\n3.96\n \n$\n3.82\n \n$\n3.74\n \nAdditionally, a common stock dividend of $\n1.03\n per share ($\n4.12\n per share on an annualized basis) was declared for shareholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 3, 2025, payable Feb. 14, 2025.\n96\nTable of Contents\nJ.    \nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities (VIE)s - \nAs of Dec. 31, 2024, we consolidate the following VIEs:\nEnLink \n- We control EnLink through our ownership of its managing member.  EnLink is a VIE because the holders of the membership interest do not have substantive kick-out rights or participating rights over the managing member.  We are the primary beneficiary of EnLink because we have the power through our \n100\n% ownership of the managing member, to control decisions that most significantly impact EnLink.  We consolidate EnLink and record a noncontrolling interest for the interest that we do not own.  We also record a noncontrolling interest related to EnLink’s Series B Preferred Units.  \nSubsequent Event\n - Upon closing of the EnLink Acquisition on Jan. 31, 2025, EnLink is no longer considered a VIE. \nDelaware Basin JV \n- EnLink owns a \n50.1\n% interest in the Delaware Basin JV, which owns processing facilities located in the Delaware Basin in Texas.  The Delaware Basin JV is a VIE because the other owner does not have substantive kick-out rights or participating rights over the managing member.  As the managing member, we are the primary beneficiary because we control the decisions that most significantly impact the Delaware Basin JV.  After June 30, 2025, our joint venture partner has the right to cause the Delaware Basin JV to commence a sale process to sell all of the outstanding interests or assets of the Delaware Basin JV for the best available price.  If our joint venture partner exercises this right, we are permitted to purchase their interest at a certain call price. \nAscension Pipeline Company, LLC (Ascension) \n- EnLink owns a \n50\n% interest in Ascension, which owns an NGL transmission pipeline that connects EnLink’s Riverside fractionator to the other owner’s refinery.  Ascension is a VIE because the other owner does not have the ability to remove us as the managing member.  They also do not have the ability to participate or block our decisions as the managing member, which makes us the primary beneficiary because we control the decisions that most significantly impact Ascension.\nThe following table presents the balance sheet information for the assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet: \nDec. 31, 2024\n(Millions of dollars)\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n46\n \nAccounts receivable, net\n735\n \nInventories\n54\n \nOther current assets\n39\n \nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n11,397\n \nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliates\n317\n \nGoodwill\n2,717\n \nIntangible assets, net\n1,047\n \nOther assets\n134\n \nLiabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n$\n422\n \nAccounts payable\n639\n \nCommodity imbalances\n10\n \nAccrued taxes\n5\n \nAccrued interest\n73\n \nOther current liabilities\n85\n \nLong-term debt, excluding current maturities\n4,693\n \nDeferred income taxes\n2,041\n \nOther deferred credits\n97\n \n97\nTable of Contents\nK.    \nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS for the periods indicated:\n \nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2024\n \nIncome\nShares\nPer Share\nAmount\n \n(\nMillions, except per share amounts\n)\nBasic EPS\n \n \n \nNet income attributable to ONEOK available for common stock\n$\n3,034\n \n584.6\n \n$\n5.19\n \nDiluted EPS\nEffect of dilutive securities\n—\n \n1.9\n \nNet income attributable to ONEOK available for common stock and common stock equivalents\n$\n3,034\n \n586.5\n \n$\n5.17\n \n \nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2023\n \nIncome\nShares\nPer Share\nAmount\n \n(Millions, except per share amounts\n)\nBasic EPS\n \n \n \nNet income available for common stock\n$\n2,658\n \n484.3\n \n$\n5.49\n \nDiluted EPS \nEffect of dilutive securities\n—\n \n1.1\n \nNet income available for common stock and common stock equivalents\n$\n2,658\n \n485.4\n \n$\n5.48\n \n \nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2022\n \nIncome\nShares\nPer Share\nAmount\n \n(Millions, except per share amounts\n)\nBasic EPS\n \n \n \nNet income available for common stock\n$\n1,721\n \n447.5\n \n$\n3.85\n \nDiluted EPS \nEffect of dilutive securities\n—\n \n0.9\n \nNet income available for common stock and common stock equivalents\n$\n1,721\n \n448.4\n \n$\n3.84\n \nL.    \nSHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\nOur Equity Incentive Plan (EIP) provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards, to eligible employees and the granting of stock awards to non-employee directors.  We have reserved \n8.5\n million shares of common stock for issuance under the EIP and at Dec. 31, 2024, we had \n3.2\n million shares available for issuance under the plan.  This calculation of available shares reflects shares issued and estimated shares expected to be issued upon vesting of outstanding awards granted under the EIP, excluding estimated forfeitures expected to be returned to the plan.  \nEnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition\n - As discussed in Note B, we completed the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition on Oct. 15, 2024.  EnLink has previously issued restricted incentive units and performance units that vest at the end of a designated period, typically \nthree years\n.  The fair value of these awards attributable to pre-combination service was allocated to consideration transferred and was included as part of the purchase price.  The portion attributable to post-combination service is being recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period of the awards.  Compensation expense for the unit-based awards of EnLink for the ownership period is not material. In addition, unrecognized compensation expense related to the outstanding EnLink restricted incentive units and performance units is not material. \nMagellan Acquisition\n - As discussed in Note B, we completed the Magellan Acquisition on Sept. 25, 2023.  Prior to the acquisition, Magellan had previously issued unit-based awards consisting of time-vested phantom units and performance phantom units, that vested at the end of a designated period, typically \nthree years\n.  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding unit-based award was converted into a restricted stock unit and measured at their acquisition date fair value as if they were vested and issued on the acquisition date.  The fair value attributable to pre-combination service was allocated to consideration transferred and was included as part of the purchase price.  The portion attributable to post-\n98\nTable of Contents\ncombination service is being recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period of the awards.  Converted restricted stock unit awards accrue dividend equivalents that are paid out in cash at vesting.  \nRestricted Stock Units\n - We have granted restricted stock units to key employees that vest at the end of a designated period, typically \nthree years\n, and entitle the grantee to receive shares of our common stock.  Restricted stock unit awards are measured at fair value as if they were vested and issued on the grant date and adjusted for estimated forfeitures. \n \nRestricted stock unit awards accrue dividend equivalents in the form of additional restricted stock units prior to vesting.  Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.\nPerformance Unit Awards\n - We have granted performance unit awards to key employees that vest at the end of a \nthree\n-year period.  Upon vesting, a holder of outstanding performance units is entitled to receive a number of shares of our common stock equal to a percentage (\n0\n% to \n200\n%) of the performance units granted, based on our total shareholder return over the vesting period, compared with the total shareholder return of a peer group of other energy companies over the same period.  Performance unit awards are measured at fair value on the grant date based on a Monte Carlo model and adjusted for estimated forfeitures.  Performance unit awards accrue dividend equivalents in the form of additional performance units prior to vesting.  Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.\nStock Compensation for Non-Employee Directors\n - The EIP provides for the granting of nonstatutory stock options and stock bonus awards to non-employee directors, including performance unit awards and restricted stock unit awards.  Under the EIP, awards may be granted by the Executive Compensation Committee at any time, until grants have been made for all shares authorized under the EIP.  The maximum number of shares of common stock and cash-based awards that can be issued to a participant under the EIP during any year is limited to $\n0.8\n million in value as of the grant date.  \nNo\n performance unit awards or restricted stock unit awards have been made to non-employee directors, and there are \nno\n options outstanding.\nGeneral\n - For all awards outstanding, we used a \n3\n% forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures under our share-based payment plans.  We currently use treasury stock to satisfy our share-based payment obligations.\nCompensation expense, exclusive of those recognized within transaction costs, for our share-based payment plans was $\n102\n million, $\n63\n million and $\n53\n million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, before related tax benefits of $\n36\n million, $\n14\n million and $\n13\n million, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Unit Activity\n - As of Dec. 31, 2024, we had $\n43\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our nonvested restricted stock unit awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n1.7\n years.  \nThe following tables set forth activity and various statistics for our restricted stock unit awards:\nNumber of\nUnits\nWeighted\nAverage Price\nNonvested Dec. 31, 2023 (a)\n1,724,565\n \n$\n62.08\n \nGranted\n512,427\n \n$\n75.42\n \nReleased to participants (b)\n(\n808,544\n)\n$\n58.60\n \nForfeited (b)\n(\n68,326\n)\n$\n71.14\n \nNonvested Dec. 31, 2024 (c)\n1,360,122\n \n$\n68.71\n \n(a) - Includes \n847,120\n unvested restricted stock unit awards granted in conjunction with the Magellan Acquisition.\n(b) - Includes \n509,077\n restricted stock unit awards released to participants and forfeited in conjunction with the Magellan Acquisition.\n(c) - Includes \n338,043\n restricted stock that remain unvested related to the Magellan Acquisition. \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted-average grant date fair value (per share)\n$\n75.42\n \n$\n66.50\n \n$\n60.96\n \nFair value of units granted (millions of dollars)\n$\n39\n \n$\n111\n \n$\n20\n \nGrant date fair value of units vested (millions of dollars)\n$\n47\n \n$\n48\n \n$\n14\n \n99\nTable of Contents\nPerformance Unit Activity\n - As of Dec. 31, 2024, we had\n \n$\n38\n million \nof tot\nal unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested performance unit awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n1.8\n years.  \nThe following tables set forth activity and various statistics related to the performance unit awards and the assumptions used in the valuations at the respective grant dates:\nNumber of\nUnits\nWeighted\nAverage Price\nNonvested Dec. 31, 2023\n1,094,940\n \n$\n75.22\n \nGranted\n452,360\n \n$\n85.69\n \nReleased to participants\n(\n418,357\n)\n$\n62.32\n \nForfeited\n(\n29,244\n)\n$\n82.10\n \nNonvested Dec. 31, 2024\n1,099,699\n \n$\n84.25\n \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nVolatility (a)\n29.00\n%\n63.30\n%\n61.10\n%\nDividend yield\n5.40\n%\n5.75\n%\n6.15\n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.46\n%\n4.43\n%\n1.78\n%\n(a) - Volatility was based on historical volatility over \nthree years\n using daily stock price observations.\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted-average grant date fair value (per share)\n$\n85.69\n \n$\n87.46\n \n$\n79.05\n \nFair value of units granted (millions of dollars)\n$\n39\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n32\n \nGrant date fair value of units vested (millions of dollars)\n$\n26\n \n$\n21\n \n$\n20\n \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\n - We have reserved a total of \n12\n million shares of common stock for issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP).  Subject to certain exclusions, all employees are eligible to participate in the ESPP.  Employees can choose to have up to \n10\n% of their base pay withheld from each paycheck during the offering period to purchase our common stock, subject to terms and limitations of the plan.  The purchase price of the stock is \n85\n% of the lower of its grant date or exercise date market price.  Approximately \n59\n%, \n69\n% and \n68\n% of employees participated in the plan in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Under the plan, we sold \n275,874\n shares at a weighted average of $\n64.38\n per share in 2024, \n236,108\n shares at a weighted average of $\n52.70\n per share in 2023 and \n235,583\n shares at a weighted average of $\n47.21\n per share in 2022.\nEmployee Stock Award Program\n - Under our Employee Stock Award Program, we issued, for no monetary consideration, to all eligible employees one share of our common stock when the per-share closing price of our common stock on the NYSE is at or above each one-dollar increment above its previous high closing price.  We originally reserved a total of \n900,000\n shares of common stock for issuance under this program.  Shares issued to employees under this program during 2024 totaled \n127,825\n and we have fully awarded all shares allocated to the program.  We expect to request additional shares be issued and allocated to the program during the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Employees have received awards through the $\n103\n milestone.  \nNo\n shares were issued to employees under this program in 2023 or 2022.  \nDeferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors\n - Our Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides our non-employee directors the option to defer all or a portion of their compensation for their service on our Board of Directors.  Under the plan, directors may elect either a cash deferral option or a phantom stock option.  Under the cash deferral option, directors may elect to defer the receipt of all or a portion of their annual retainer fees, which will be credited with interest during the deferral period.  Under the phantom stock option, directors may defer all or a portion of their annual retainer fees and receive such fees on a deferred basis in the form of shares of common stock under our EIP, which earn the equivalent of dividends declared on our common stock.  Shares are distributed to non-employee directors at the fair market value of our common stock at the date of distribution.\nM.    \nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nRetirement and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nONEOK Legacy Retirement Plan\n - We have a legacy defined benefit pension plan covering certain employees and former employees, which closed to new participants in 2005.  In addition, we have a supplemental executive retirement plan for the benefit of certain officers who participate in our defined benefit pension plan.  Our supplemental executive retirement plan is closed to new participants.  We fund our defined benefit pension plan at a level needed to maintain or exceed the minimum funding levels required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.\n100\nTable of Contents\nMagellan Legacy Retirement Plans\n - As a result of the Magellan Acquisition, we assumed the pension plan assets and obligations of Magellan in 2023.  These obligations are composed of \ntwo\n defined benefit pension plans, including one for non-union employees and one for union employees.  The pension plan for non-union employees closed to new participants upon the closing of the acquisition.  The pension plan for union employees closed to new participants in January 2024.  We fund these defined benefit pension plans at a level needed to maintain or exceed the minimum funding levels required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  \nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\n - We sponsor legacy health and welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to employees hired prior to 2017 who retire with at least \nfive years\n of full-time consecutive service.  The postretirement medical plan for pre-Medicare participants is contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted periodically, and contains other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance.  The postretirement medical plan for Medicare-eligible participants is an account-based plan under which participants may elect to purchase private insurance policies under a private exchange and/or seek reimbursement of other eligible medical expenses.  In 2023, we also assumed the postretirement benefit obligations of Magellan which covers certain employees of Magellan.\nObligations and Funded Status\n - \nThe following table sets forth our retirement and other postretirement benefit plans benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for the periods indicated:\nRetirement Benefits\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nDec. 31,\nDec. 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nChange in benefit obligation\n(Millions of dollars\n)\nBenefit obligation, beginning of period\n$\n702\n \n$\n423\n \n$\n51\n \n$\n38\n \nService cost\n21\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \nInterest cost\n37\n \n27\n \n2\n \n2\n \nPlan participants’ contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \nActuarial (gain) loss\n(\n35\n)\n38\n \n(\n5\n)\n3\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n36\n)\n(\n33\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n4\n)\nMagellan Acquisition\n—\n \n240\n \n—\n \n11\n \nBenefit obligation, end of period (a)\n689\n \n702\n \n46\n \n51\n \nChange in plan assets\n \n \nFair value of plan assets, beginning of period\n554\n \n322\n \n16\n \n17\n \nActual return on plan assets\n12\n \n60\n \n1\n \n2\n \nEmployer contributions\n5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPlan participants’ contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n36\n)\n(\n33\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n4\n)\nMagellan Acquisition\n—\n \n205\n \n—\n \n—\n \nFair value of plan assets, end of period (b)\n535\n \n554\n \n15\n \n16\n \nBalance at Dec. 31\n$\n(\n154\n)\n$\n(\n148\n)\n$\n(\n31\n)\n$\n(\n35\n)\nCurrent liabilities\n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nNoncurrent liabilities\n(\n149\n)\n(\n143\n)\n(\n31\n)\n(\n35\n)\nBalance at Dec. 31\n$\n(\n154\n)\n$\n(\n148\n)\n$\n(\n31\n)\n$\n(\n35\n)\n(a) - The benefit obligation for Retirement Benefits at Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, include the supplemental executive retirement plan obligation.\n(b) - Fair value of plan assets for Retirement Benefits exclude the assets of our supplemental executive retirement plan, which totaled $\n92\n million and $\n89\n million at Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and are not treated as assets of the supplemental executive retirement plan.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for our retirement plans was $\n628\n million and $\n637\n million at Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe components of net periodic benefit cost and related assumptions, and amounts recognized in other comprehensive income related to our retirement and other postretirement benefit plans are not material.  The balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss at Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, was $\n58\n million and $\n64\n million, respectively.  This balance is expected to be amortized over the average remaining service period of employees participating in these plans. \n101\nTable of Contents\nActuarial Assumptions\n - \nThe following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for retirement and other postretirement benefits for the periods indicated:\nRetirement Benefits\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nDec. 31,\nDec. 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nDiscount rate\n5.80\n%\n5.40\n%\n5.80\n%\n5.50\n%\nCompensation increase rate\n3.65\n%\n3.65\n%\nNA\nNA\nInterest credit rating (a)\n4.78\n%\n4.03\n%\nNA\nNA\n(a) - This actuarial assumption is only applicable to the pension plans assumed with the Magellan Acquisition.\nWe determine our discount rates annually utilizing portfolios of high-quality bonds matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our retirement and other postretirement benefit plans.  Bonds selected to be included in the portfolios are only those rated by S&P or Moody’s as an AA or Aa2 rating or better and exclude callable bonds, bonds with less than a minimum issue size, yield outliers and other filtering criteria to remove unsuitable bonds.\n \nPlan Assets\n - Our investment strategy is to invest plan assets in accordance with sound investment practices that emphasize long-term fundamentals.  The goal of this strategy is to maximize investment returns while managing risk in order to meet the plan’s current and projected financial obligations.  The investment allocation for our ONEOK legacy defined benefit pension plan follows a glide path approach of liability-driven investing that shifts a higher portfolio weighting to fixed income as the plan’s funded status increases.  A majority of the legacy Magellan pension assets are allocated to fixed income securities and invested to match the duration of the plans’ short, intermediate and long-term liabilities, with the remaining amount allocated to equity securities.  Our pension plans utilize a diversified mix of investments that may include domestic and international equities, short, intermediate and long term corporate and government obligations, real estate and hedge funds.  \nThe combined target allocation for the assets of our pension plans as of Dec. 31, 2024, is as follows:\nDomestic and international equities\n32\n \n%\nLong duration fixed income\n55\n \n%\nReturn-seeking credit\n5\n \n%\nHedge funds\n5\n \n%\nReal estate funds\n3\n \n%\nTotal\n100\n \n%\nAs part of our risk management for the plans, minimums and maximums have been set for each of the asset classes listed above.\n102\nTable of Contents\nThe fair value of the plan assets for our other postretirement benefit plans as of Dec. 31, 2024, are not material.

We match \n100\n% of employee 401(k) Plan contributions up to \n6\n% of each participant’s eligible compensation each payroll period, subject to certain limits.  We also make profit-sharing contributions under our 401(k) Plan for employees who do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans.  We generally make a quarterly profit-sharing contribution equal to \n1\n% of each profit-sharing participant’s eligible compensation during the quarter and an annual discretionary profit-sharing contribution equal to a percentage of each profit-sharing participant’s eligible compensation.  Effective Jan. 1, 2025, the profit-sharing quarterly contributions will increase to \n6\n% from \n1\n% of quarterly eligible compensation.  We will continue to make annual discretionary contributions of up to \n2\n% of eligible compensation.  Our contributions made to the plan, including profit-sharing contributions, were $\n66\n million, $\n44\n million and $\n35\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nMedallion terminated the legacy Medallion 401(k) Plan effective Oct. 30, 2024, prior to the closing of the Medallion Acquisition on Oct. 31, 2024.  Legacy Medallion employees may roll their Medallion 401(k) Plan account balance to the ONEOK 401(k) Plan or an individual retirement account or take a distribution. \nIn September 2023, the legacy Magellan 401(k) Plan was terminated as a result of the Magellan Acquisition, and legacy Magellan employees were given the option to roll their 401(k) balances into the existing ONEOK 401(k) Plan or to their individual retirement accounts.  The Magellan 401(k) plan was liquidated and closed in September 2024.\nSubsequent event\n - EnLink terminated the EnLink 401(k) Plan effective Jan. 30, 2025, prior to the closing of the EnLink Acquisition.  Legacy EnLink employees may roll their EnLink 401(k) Plan account balance to the ONEOK 401(k) Plan, an individual retirement account or take a distribution.\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan\n - The 2020 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan and its predecessor nonqualified deferred compensation plans (collectively, the NQDC Plan) provide a select group of management and highly compensated employees, as approved by our chief executive officer, with the option to defer portions of their compensation and receive notional employer contributions that generally are not available due to limitations on employer and employee contributions to qualified defined contribution plans under federal tax laws.  Our investments which are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the NQDC Plan are not material.  These investments are maintained in a rabbi trust.

EnLink is now a wholly owned subsidiary and included in our consolidated income tax returns.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2024, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of $\n13.4\n billion, the majority of which have an indefinite carryforward period.  We expect to generate taxable income and utilize these net operating loss carryforwards in future periods.  We also have loss and credit carryovers in multiple states, $\n11.0\n billion of which, have an indefinite carryforward period and $\n2.3\n billion\n \nof which will expire between 2026 and 2044.  We have deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards of $\n3.3\n billion and $\n3.0\n billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  We believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of certain state carryforwards will not be utilized; therefore, we recorded a valuation allowance, which was increased by $\n12\n million and $\n165\n million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, a\nnd reduced by\n $\n1\n million\n in \n2022 through net income.\n O.    \nUNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nEnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition\n - As a result of the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates includes EnLink’s \nthree\n unconsolidated affiliates.

Claims were asserted by or on behalf of \nseven\n individuals, and certain beneficiaries, who were employed by a contractor of Magellan and were injured, one fatally, as a result of a fire that occurred on Dec. 5, 2020, while they were cleaning a tank at our Corpus Christi terminal.  In 2024, we reached settlement with all remaining claimants, and all settlement payments were made, and were fully offset by insurance proceeds received.\nWe are a party to various other legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of our operations.  While the results of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the reasonably possible losses from such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, are not material.  Additionally, we believe the probable final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nQ.    \nLEASES\n \nLessee activity\n - \nThe following table sets forth information about our operating lease assets and liabilities included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated:\nLeases\nLocation in our Consolidated Balance Sheets\nDec. 31, 2024\nDec. 31, 2023\n \n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\nOperating leases assets\nOther assets\n$\n220\n \n$\n104\n \nOperating leases liabilities\nCurrent\nOther current liabilities\n$\n62\n \n$\n23\n \nNoncurrent\nOther deferred credits\n154\n \n74\n \nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n216\n \n$\n97\n \nThe weighted average remaining lease term for our operating leases was \n9.1\n years and \n6.3\n years at Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The weighted average discount rate for our operating leases was \n5.51\n% and \n5.78\n% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Our weighted-average discount rates represent the rate implicit in the lease or our incremental borrowing rate for a term equal to the remaining term of the lease.\nThe following table sets forth the maturity of our lease liabilities as of Dec. 31, 2024:\nOperating\nLeases\n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\n2025\n$\n72\n \n2026\n52\n \n2027\n30\n \n2028\n25\n \n2029\n21\n \n2030 and beyond\n75\n \nTotal lease payments\n275\n \nLess:  Interest\n59\n \nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$\n216\n \nOur lease costs and supplemental cash flow information related to our leases for the periods ended Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, are not material.\n \n108\nTable of Contents\nR.    \nREVENUES\nUnsatisfied Performance Obligations\n - We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) variable consideration on contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.  \nThe following table presents aggregate value allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations as of Dec. 31, 2024, and the amounts we expect to recognize in revenue in future periods, related primarily to firm transportation and storage contracts with remaining contract terms ranging from \ntwo months\n to\n16\n years:\nExpected Period of Recognition in Revenue\n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\n2025\n$\n1,230\n \n2026\n1,058\n \n2027\n993\n \n2028\n917\n \n2029 and beyond\n3,314\n \nTotal estimated transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations\n$\n7,512\n \nThe table above excludes variable consideration allocated entirely to wholly unsatisfied performance obligations, wholly unsatisfied promises to transfer distinct goods or services that are part of a single performance obligation and consideration we determine to be fully constrained.  Information on the nature of the variable consideration excluded and the nature of the performance obligations to which the variable consideration relates can be found in the description of the major contract types discussed in Note A.  The amounts we determined to be fully constrained relate to future sales obligations under long-term sales contracts where the value is not known and minimum volume agreements, which we consider to be fully constrained until invoiced.\nS.    \nSEGMENTS\nSegment Descriptions\n - Our operations are divided into \nfour\n reportable business segments, as follows:\n•\nour Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment gathers, treats, processes and markets natural gas;\n•\nour Natural Gas Liquids segment gathers, treats, fractionates and transports NGLs and stores, markets and distributes Purity NGLs;\n•\nour Natural Gas Pipelines segment transports, stores and markets natural gas; \nand\n•\nour Refined Products and Crude segment gathers, transports, stores, distributes, blends and markets Refined Products and crude oil.  \nOn Oct. 15, 2024, we completed the EnLink Controlling Interest Acquisition.  EnLink’s results of operations are reported across all \nfour\n of our existing operating segments from the period of Oct. 15, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024.  On Oct. 31, 2024, we completed the Medallion Acquisition.  Medallion’s results of operations are reported in our Refined Products and Crude segment from the period of Nov. 1, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024. \nOther and eliminations consist of corporate costs, the operating activities of our headquarters building and related parking facility, the activity of our wholly owned captive insurance company and eliminations necessary to reconcile our reportable segments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor the years ended Dec. 31, 2024, and Dec. 31, 2022, we had no single customer from which we received 10% or more of our consolidated revenues.  For the year ended Dec. 31, 2023, revenues from one customer impacting all our segments represented approximately \n11\n% of our consolidated revenues.  \nThe significant expense categories and amounts included in the table below align with the segment-level information that is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.\n109\nTable of Contents\nOperating Segment Information\n - \nThe following tables set forth certain selected financial information for our operating segments for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2024\nNatural Gas\nGathering and\nProcessing\nNatural Gas\nLiquids\nNatural Gas\nPipelines\nRefined Products and Crude\nTotal\nSegments\n \n(\nMillions of dollars\n)\nLiquids commodity sales\n$\n3,033\n \n$\n14,446\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,258\n \n$\n19,737\n \nResidue natural gas sales\n1,203\n \n—\n \n137\n \n—\n \n1,340\n \nExchange services and natural gas gathering and processing revenue\n260\n \n500\n \n—\n \n—\n \n760\n \nTransportation and storage revenue\n70\n \n207\n \n684\n \n2,082\n \n3,043\n \nOther revenue\n23\n \n14\n \n1\n \n120\n \n158\n \nTotal revenues (a)\n4,589\n \n15,167\n \n822\n \n4,460\n \n25,038\n \nCost of sales and fuel (exclusive of depreciation and operating costs)\n(\n2,600\n)\n(\n11,994\n)\n(\n112\n)\n(\n1,949\n)\n(\n16,655\n)\nOperating costs\n(\n603\n)\n(\n762\n)\n(\n233\n)\n(\n888\n)\n(\n2,486\n)\nAdjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates\n3\n \n95\n \n187\n \n247\n \n532\n \nNoncash compensation expense\n20\n \n34\n \n8\n \n31\n \n93\n \nOther (b)\n75\n \n3\n \n228\n \n(\n9\n)\n297\n \nSegment adjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,484\n \n$\n2,543\n \n$\n900\n \n$\n1,892\n \n$\n6,819\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n(\n325\n)\n$\n(\n361\n)\n$\n(\n88\n)\n$\n(\n354\n)\n$\n(\n1,128\n)\nEquity in net earnings from investments\n$\n—\n \n$\n85\n \n$\n143\n \n$\n211\n \n$\n439\n \nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliates\n$\n33\n \n$\n484\n \n$\n764\n \n$\n1,031\n \n$\n2,312\n \nTotal assets\n$\n15,856\n \n$\n19,797\n \n$\n5,041\n \n$\n23,181\n \n$\n63,875\n \nCapital expenditures\n$\n492\n \n$\n987\n \n$\n258\n \n$\n216\n \n$\n1,953\n \n(a) - Intersegment revenues are primarily from commodity sales, which are based on the contracted selling price that is generally index-based and settled monthly.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
