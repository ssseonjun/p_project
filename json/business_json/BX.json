    "item1": "Item 1. Business — Business Segments.” \nWe generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies, and from capital markets services. We also invest in the funds we manage and we are entitled to a \npro-rata\n share of the income of the fund (a \n“pro-rata\n allocation”). In addition to a \npro-rata\n allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, we are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest (“Performance Allocations”). In certain structures, we receive a contractual incentive fee from an investment vehicle based on achieving certain investment returns (an “Incentive Fee,” and together with Performance Allocations, “Performance Revenues”). The composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. Net investment gains and investment income generated by the Blackstone Funds are driven by the performance of the underlying investments as well as overall market conditions. Fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our portfolio companies and other investments, the industries in which they operate, the overall economy and other market conditions. \nBusiness Environment \nBlackstone’s businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world. \nGlobal markets experienced volatility in 2024, due to significant movement in Treasury yields, a strong U.S. Dollar, global geopolitical instability and macroeconomic uncertainty. The \n10-year\n Treasury yield increased 86 basis points from the beginning of 2024 to an intraday high of 4.74% in April, declined 114 basis points to an intraday low of 3.6% in September, and subsequently rose again to end the year at 4.57%. Short-term rates decreased in 2024 with three-month SOFR down 103 basis points to 4.31%. The U.S. Dollar appreciated against major currencies in the fourth quarter and full year, including the Pound Sterling, Euro, Canadian Dollar, and Indian Rupee. \nMost major equity markets appreciated in the fourth quarter of 2024. The S&P 500 delivered a total return of 2.0% in the fourth quarter and 25.0% for the full year. All sectors gained during the year, led by the telecom sector, which rose 40.2%. In credit markets, the S&P leveraged loan index increased 9.0% in 2024 while the Credit Suisse high yield bond index rose 7.9%. High yield spreads tightened 57 basis points in 2024, while issuance increased 64% year-over-year. Base rates were volatile during the year. Equity market volatility increased, with the CBOE Volatility Index up 39% year-over-year. Oil prices were largely unchanged, with the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil up 0.1% in 2024 to $71.72 per barrel. The Henry Hub Natural Gas spot price increased 45% year-over-year to $3.63. \n \n86 \nTable of Contents\nThe U.S. economy exhibited steady growth in 2024, underpinned by a healthy labor market and consumer spending. The advance estimate of U.S. real GDP for 2024 indicated growth of 2.8% year-over-year, in line with 2.9% growth recorded in 2023. Inflation decreased moderately over the course of 2024, with headline CPI decreasing from 3.1% year-over-year growth in January 2024 to 2.9% in December 2024, and Core CPI decreasing from 3.9% year-over-year growth in January 2024 to 3.2% year-over-year in December 2024. The Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds target range three times in 2024 to \n4.25%-4.50%\n by year end. The Federal Reserve held rates steady in January 2025, indicating its expectations for a slower pace of rate cuts moving forward. The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.1% in December 2024, but further decreased below forecasts to 4.0% in January 2025, suggesting a tightening labor market. Average hourly earnings increasing 4.1% year-over-year and 0.5% month-over-month in January 2025. Meanwhile, shelter cost inflation has decreased since the end of 2023, declining to 4.6% in December 2024 as compared to 6.2% the prior year. In manufacturing, the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers’ Index increased to 49.2 in December 2024 compared to 46.9 in 2023. \nOutside the U.S., several major economies demonstrated slower GDP growth and began loosening monetary policy after an extended period of tightening due to decreasing inflation. Eurozone real GDP declined to 2.4% annual growth in December 2024 from 2.9% in December 2023. Inflation in the Eurozone fell from 2.8% year-over-year growth in January 2024 to 2.4% at year end despite the European Central Bank lowering its deposit facility by 100 basis points during the year and an additional 25 basis points in February 2025. In China, real GDP grew 5.0% year-over-year in 2024, down from 5.4% in 2023 and below the average of the preceding ten years. In Japan, the advance estimate of real GDP indicated a contraction of 0.2% year-over-year in 2024, down from 1.5% growth in 2023. \nCapital markets activity expanded moderately, with global initial public offering volumes up 4% and global announced merger and acquisition volumes up 12% compared to 2023; however, both metrics remain below prior peak levels. \nDuring 2024, the U.S. made meaningful progress on inflation and maintained a healthy economy, which helped improve investor sentiment. Nonetheless, continued geopolitical turbulence, the potential for slower-than-anticipated interest rate decreases, and U.S. trade, immigration and other policy and regulatory changes are contributing to economic outlook uncertainty, including a potential economic slowdown. \nNotable Transactions \nOn December 6, 2024, Blackstone, through its indirect subsidiary Blackstone Reg Finance Co. L.L.C., issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due December 6, 2034 pursuant to a Registration Statement on \nForm S-3\n (the “Registered 2034 Notes”). \nFor additional information see Note 12. “Borrowings” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —Sources and Uses of Liquidity.” \n \n87 \nTable of Contents\nOrganizational Structure \nThe simplified diagram below depicts our current organizational structure. The diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held. \n \n\n\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators \nWe manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). See “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “— Critical Accounting Policies.” Our key \nnon-GAAP\n financial measures and operating indicators and metrics are discussed below. \nDistributable Earnings \nDistributable Earnings is derived from Blackstone’s segment reported results. Distributable Earnings is used to assess performance and amounts available for dividends to Blackstone stockholders, including Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. Distributable Earnings is the sum of Segment Distributable Earnings plus Net Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) less Taxes and Related Payables. Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See \n“— Non-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Distributable Earnings. \n \n88 \nTable of Contents\nNet Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) is presented on a segment basis and is equal to Interest and Dividend Revenue less Interest Expense, adjusted for the impact of consolidation of Blackstone Funds, and interest expense associated with the Tax Receivable Agreement. \nTaxes and Related Payables represent the total GAAP tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes and including the Payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Further, the current tax provision utilized when calculating Taxes and Related Payables and Distributable Earnings reflects the benefit of deductions available to the company on certain expense items that are excluded from the underlying calculation of Segment Distributable Earnings and Total Segment Distributable Earnings, such as equity-based compensation charges and certain Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items where there is a current tax provision or benefit. The economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are the same as those methodologies and assumptions used in calculating the current income tax provision for Blackstone’s Consolidated Statements of Operations under GAAP, excluding the impact of divestitures and accrued tax contingencies and refunds which are reflected when paid or received. Management believes that including the amount payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement and utilizing the current income tax provision adjusted as described above when calculating Distributable Earnings is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings that are available for distribution to stockholders. \nSegment Distributable Earnings \nSegment Distributable Earnings is Blackstone’s segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across Blackstone’s four segments. Blackstone believes it is useful to stockholders to review the measure that management uses in assessing segment performance. Segment Distributable Earnings represents the net realized earnings of Blackstone’s segments and is the sum of Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations for each segment. Blackstone’s segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates Blackstone Funds, eliminates \nnon-controlling\n ownership interests in Blackstone’s consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items. Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and \nnon-recurring\n gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and \nnon-recurring\n gains, losses or other charges that affect \nperiod-to-period\n comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone’s operational performance. Segment Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “— \nNon-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Segment Distributable Earnings. \nNet Realizations is presented on a segment basis and is the sum of Realized Principal Investment Income and Realized Performance Revenues (which refers to Realized Performance Revenues excluding Fee Related Performance Revenues), less Realized Performance Compensation (which refers to Realized Performance Compensation excluding Fee Related Performance Compensation and Equity-Based Performance Compensation). \nRealized Performance Compensation reflects an increase in the aggregate Realized Performance Compensation paid to certain of our professionals above the amounts allocable to them based upon the percentage participation in the relevant performance plans previously awarded to them. In the year ended December 31, 2024, Realized Performance Compensation increased by an aggregate of $83.1 million and Fee Related Compensation decreased by a corresponding amount. In the year ended December 31, 2023, Realized Performance Compensation increased by an aggregate of $65.0 million and Fee Related Compensation decreased by a corresponding amount. These changes to Realized Performance Compensation and Fee Related Compensation reduced Net Realizations, increased Fee Related Earnings and had a neutral impact to Income Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes and Distributable Earnings in the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n \n89 \nTable of Contents\nFee Related Earnings \nFee Related Earnings is a performance measure used to assess Blackstone’s ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. Blackstone believes Fee Related Earnings is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the profitability of the portion of Blackstone’s business that is not dependent on realization activity. Fee Related Earnings equals management and advisory fees (net of management fee reductions and offsets) plus Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (a) Fee Related Compensation on a segment basis and (b) Other Operating Expenses. Fee Related Earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “— \nNon-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Fee Related Earnings. \nFee Related Compensation is presented on a segment basis and refers to the compensation expense, excluding Equity-Based Compensation, directly related to (a) Management and Advisory Fees, Net and (b) Fee Related Performance Revenues, referred to as Fee Related Performance Compensation. \nFee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of Performance Revenues from Perpetual Capital that are (a) measured and received on a recurring basis and (b) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments. \nOther Operating Expenses is presented on a segment basis and is equal to General, Administrative and Other Expenses, adjusted to (a) remove transaction-related and \nnon-recurring\n items that arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and \nnon-recurring\n gains, losses or other charges, if any, (b) remove certain expenses reimbursed by the Blackstone Funds which are netted against Management and Advisory Fees, Net in Blackstone’s segment presentation and (c) give effect to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. The administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under GAAP, but is reflected as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses in Blackstone’s segment presentation. \nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization \nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), is a supplemental measure used to assess performance derived from Blackstone’s segment results and may be used to assess its ability to service its borrowings. Adjusted EBITDA represents Distributable Earnings plus the addition of (a) Interest Expense on a segment basis, (b) Taxes and Related Payables and (c) Depreciation and Amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “— \nNon-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA. \nNet Accrued Performance Revenues \nNet Accrued Performance Revenues is a \nnon-GAAP\n financial measure Blackstone believes is useful to stockholders as an indicator of potential future realized performance revenues based on the current investment portfolio of the funds and vehicles we manage. Net Accrued Performance Revenues represents the accrued performance revenues receivable by Blackstone, net of the related accrued performance compensation payable by Blackstone, excluding performance revenues that have been realized but not yet distributed as of the reporting date and clawback amounts, if any. Net Accrued Performance Revenues is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Investments. See “— \nNon-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Net Accrued Performance Revenues and Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Equity Method Investments” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information on the calculation of Investments — Accrued Performance Allocations. \n \n90 \nTable of Contents\n \nOperating Metrics \nThe alternative asset management business is primarily based on managing third-party capital and does not require substantial capital investment to support rapid growth. Since our inception, we have developed and used various key operating metrics to assess and monitor the operating performance of our various alternative asset management businesses in order to monitor the effectiveness of our value creating strategies. \nTotal and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management \n“Total Assets Under Management” refers to the invested and available capital in Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles (including, without limitation, investment funds and SMAs). The Total Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is dependent on the structure and investment strategy of such vehicle and accordingly, will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Total Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(a)\n\n\na vehicle’s invested capital at fair value which, as applicable, is measured as (1) total investments measured at fair value, or gross asset values, each of which may include the fair value of investments purchased with leverage under certain credit facilities, (2) net asset value, or (3) amount of debt and equity outstanding or aggregate par amount of assets, including principal cash for CLOs, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(b)\n\n\na vehicle’s available capital, if any, which represents (1) uncalled commitments made by investors and (2) available borrowing capacity under certain credit facilities. \nUncalled commitments represent the capital we are entitled to call from investors pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods. Drawdown funds, perpetual capital vehicles, \nco-investment\n vehicles, and SMAs can each be structured with a commitment from an investor that is called over time as opposed to fully funded upon subscription. \nAssets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit. Total Assets Under Management are reported in the segment where the assets are managed. \nOur measurement of Total Assets Under Management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from Blackstone and our personnel. Our calculation of Total Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of Total Assets Under Management differs from the manner in which affiliated investment advisors report regulatory assets under management and may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles we manage or advise. \n“Fee-Earning\n Assets Under Management” refers to the portion of Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees and/or performance revenues. The \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is driven by the basis on which fees are earned and accordingly, will vary from vehicle to vehicle. \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable: (a) net asset value, (b) committed capital and remaining invested capital during the investment period and post-investment period, respectively, (c) invested capital (including leverage to the extent management \nfee-eligible),\n (d) gross asset value, (e) fair value of investments, or (f) the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of CLOs. \n \n91 \nTable of Contents\nAssets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit. \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management are reported in the segment where the Total Assets Under Management are reported to the extent \nfee-paying\n to Blackstone. \nWhile \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management generally reflects Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees, \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may also include Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn only performance revenues. Our calculation of \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles that we manage or advise. \nCommitment-based drawdown structured funds generally do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. Certain of our open-ended vehicles generally afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually, quarterly or monthly), typically with 2 to 95 days’ notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. In our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such required redemptions are limited in quantum, such as interval funds or in certain insurance-dedicated vehicles. Investment advisory agreements related to certain SMAs in our Credit & Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing segments, excluding SMAs in our insurance platform, may generally be terminated by an investor on 15 to 95 days’ notice. SMAs in our insurance platform can generally only be terminated for long-term underperformance, cause and certain other limited circumstances, in each case subject to Blackstone’s right to cure. \nPerpetual Capital \n“Perpetual Capital” refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows or where required redemptions are limited in quantum. Perpetual Capital includes \nco-investment\n capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital. \nIn our Perpetual Capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such required redemptions are limited in quantum, such as interval funds or in certain insurance-dedicated vehicles. Perpetual Capital includes \nco-investment\n capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it represents capital we manage that has a longer duration and the ability to generate recurring revenues in a different manner than traditional fund structures. \nDry Powder \nDry Powder represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment, including general partner and employee capital, and is an indicator of the capital we have available for future investments. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the extent to which capital is available for Blackstone to deploy capital into investment opportunities as they arise. \n \n92 \nTable of Contents\nInvested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management \nInvested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management represents invested capital at fair value on which performance revenues could be earned if certain hurdles are met. We believe Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the capital deployed that has the potential to generate performance revenues. \nConsolidated Results of Operations \nFollowing is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of our four business segments (which are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds, eliminates \nnon-controlling\n ownership interests in Blackstone’s consolidated operating partnerships and removes the amortization of intangibles assets and Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items) in these periods, see “— Segment Analysis” below. \n \n93 \nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations and certain key operating

increase of $5.2 billion, compared to $8.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.3 billion in Investment Income, which was composed of increases of $3.0 billion in Unrealized Investment Income and $1.3 billion in Realized Investment Income. \nThe $3.0 billion increase in Unrealized Investment Income was primarily attributable to net unrealized appreciation of investments in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Principal drivers were: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nAn increase of $1.2 billion in our Real Estate segment, primarily attributable to lower unrealized depreciation of Blackstone’s investment in certain Core+ real estate and BREP funds in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nAn increase of $975.8 million in our Private Equity segment, primarily attributable to higher unrealized appreciation of Blackstone’s investment in certain Corporate Private Equity funds in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Corporate Private Equity funds appreciated 16.6% in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 12.1% in the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nAn increase of $688.3 million in our Credit & Insurance segment, primarily attributable to higher unrealized gain on the ownership of Corebridge common stock based on the publicly traded price as of December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, and higher unrealized appreciation of Blackstone’s investment in certain mezzanine funds in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \nThe $1.3 billion increase in Realized Investment Income was primarily attributable to higher realized gains in our Private Equity segment. \nExpenses \nExpenses were $6.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, compared to $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.7 billion in Total Compensation and Benefits, of which $1.3 billion was an increase in Performance Allocations Compensation. The increase in Performance Allocations Compensation was primarily due to the increase in Investment Income, on which a portion of compensation is based. \nOther Income (Loss) \nOther Income (Loss) was $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $132.8 million, compared to $(84.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Other Income (Loss) was principally due to an increase of $146.9 million in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities. \nThe increase in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities was driven by an increase of $169.7 million in our Real Estate segment, partially offset by a decrease of $41.0 million in our Private Equity segment. The increase in our Real Estate segment was primarily driven by lower unrealized depreciation of investments and lower realized losses on investments in our consolidated funds. The decrease in our Private Equity segment was primarily due to the deconsolidation of a fund, partially offset by higher unrealized appreciation of investments in our consolidated funds. \n \n95 \nTable of Contents\n \nProvision for Taxes \nBlackstone’s Provision for Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1.0 billion, an increase of $508.2 million, compared to $513.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.8% and 17.4% based on our Income Before Provision for Taxes of $6.5 billion and $3.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe decrease in Blackstone’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, relates primarily to the impact of \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities and a decrease in Blackstone’s state tax provisions for the jurisdictions in which it operates. \nBlackstone had a corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) liability for the year ended December 31, 2024 as calculated pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act. Blackstone will continue to assess the overall impact to its Provision for Income Tax upon the issuance of applicable additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department related to interpretations of CAMT. For the year ended December 31, 2024 there is no meaningful CAMT impact reflected in the Provision for Income Taxes given current year tax payments made under CAMT are permitted to be carried forward and used as credits in future years resulting in a deferred tax benefit. \nAdditional information regarding our income taxes can be found in “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 14. Income Taxes” of this filing. \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities \nThe Net Loss Attributable to Redeemable \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities and Net Income Attributable to \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities is attributable to the consolidated Blackstone Funds. The amounts of these items vary directly with the performance of the consolidated Blackstone Funds and largely eliminate the amount of Other Income (Loss) — Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities from the Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc. \nNet Income Attributable to \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Blackstone Holdings is derived from the Income Before Provision for Taxes at the Blackstone Holdings level, excluding the Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities and the percentage allocation of the income between Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings and Blackstone after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income such as fees allocable to Blackstone. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Net Income Before Taxes allocated to Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings was 38.5% and 39.2%, respectively. The decrease of 0.7% was primarily due to the conversion of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to shares of common stock and the vesting of shares of common stock. \nThe Other Income (Loss) — Change in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability was entirely allocated to Blackstone Inc. \nOperating Metrics \nTotal and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management \nThe following graphs and tables summarize the Total Assets Under Management by Segment and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management by Segment, followed by a rollforward of activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact was $(6.6) billion, $(1.5) billion, $(2.1) billion and $(10.8) billion for the Real Estate, Private Equity, Credit & Insurance and Total segments, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h)\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the impact to \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management from foreign exchange rate fluctuations was $(3.0) billion, $(278.0) million, $(1.1) billion, $(651.2) million, and $(5.1) billion for the Real Estate, Private Equity, Credit & Insurance, Multi-Asset Investing and Total segments, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact was $1.6 billion, $110.2 million, $1.0 billion, $223.5 million and $3.0 billion for the Real Estate, Private Equity, Credit & Insurance, Multi-Asset Investing and Total segments, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact was $(3.5) billion, $(1.7) billion and $(5.9) billion for the Real Estate, Credit & Insurance and Total segments, respectively. \nEffective during the third quarter of 2024, the residential debt business was transferred from Real Estate to Credit & Insurance to align with a change in Blackstone’s management of those businesses. This organizational change resulted in a decrease (reflected as an outflow) for the year ended December 31, 2024 to Real Estate Total and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management and an increase (reflected as a contra-outflow) to Credit & Insurance Total and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management (the “Residential Debt Transfer”). These changes do not impact Blackstone’s Total or \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management or outflows in total. \nTotal Assets Under Management and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may have differences in the measurement and timing of certain activities that affect each of inflows, outflows, realizations and market activity. These differences include, but are not limited to: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nFor commitment-based drawdown funds, Total Assets Under Management inflows are generally reported at each fund closing whereas \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management inflows are generally reported when a fund’s investment period commences. Fund closings and the investment period commencement generally occur in different periods and as such, \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management inflows in such funds may exceed Total Assets Under Management inflows in the period when the investment period commences. This is most prevalent in our Real Estate and Private Equity segments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nFor commitment-based drawdown funds, Total Assets Under Management realizations generally represents the total proceeds whereas \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management generally represents only the invested capital. As such, Total Assets Under Management realizations typically exceeds \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management realizations. This is most prevalent in our Real Estate and Private Equity segments. \n \n100 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nFor commitment-based drawdown funds, Total Assets Under Management is reported based on invested capital at fair value and available capital whereas \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management is reported based on committed or remaining invested capital. As such, Total Assets Under Management market activity generally exceeds \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management market activity. This is most prevalent in our Real Estate and Private Equity segments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nFor certain credit funds, Total Assets Under Management are based on gross asset value while \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management are based on net asset value. As such, Total Assets Under Management inflows, outflows, realizations and market activity for the period generally exceed the \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management inflows, outflows, realizations and market activity for the period. \nTotal Assets Under Management \nTotal Assets Under Management were $1,127.2 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $87.0 billion compared to $1,040.2 billion at December 31, 2023.

December 31, 2024, a decrease of $127.5 million, compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to decreases of $113.3 million in Fee Related Earnings and $14.2 million in Net Realizations. \nThe performance of funds in our Real Estate segment in 2024 was negatively impacted by volatility in the \n10-year\n Treasury yield, including a sharp increase in the fourth quarter, and a strong U.S. dollar. However, we believe a commercial real estate recovery is underway. Although the pace of such recovery is uncertain, the underpinnings are firmly in place, including a healthy economic backdrop that supports cash flow growth, meaningful improvements in the cost and availability of capital and a material decrease in construction starts. Subject to inflation subsiding, this should set the stage for a multi-year recovery. The constraints on future new supply, including in certain sectors in which our global opportunistic and Core+ real estate portfolios are concentrated, such as logistics and rental housing, should also support real estate values over time. \nWe additionally continue to believe that, despite recent speculation about data center demand, there will continue to be significant demand for digital infrastructure as artificial intelligence and other technological innovation is increasingly adopted and developed. Our Real Estate segment is well positioned to benefit from this trend. In certain markets and sectors with elevated near-term supply, including U.S. logistics and multifamily, however, growth has slowed and may moderate further. Life science office and traditional office valuations have also been negatively impacted by challenging sector dynamics and capital markets. While our NYSE-listed REIT, Blackstone Mortgage Trust (“BXMT”), is mostly focused in sectors with strong long-term fundamentals, its office exposure is higher than in our real estate equity business. Although this has posed challenges for the vehicle, its office exposure has been meaningfully reduced through loan resolutions and repayments. Given our conviction that a recovery is underway, our Real Estate funds deployed $25.3 billion in 2024, a nearly 70% increase year over year. While we expect our real estate realization activity to remain muted as commercial real estate continues to recover, we believe the market for realizations will strengthen over time. In BREIT, improving investor sentiment throughout 2024 has contributed to favorable trends in net flows, with a 97% decline in net repurchase requests in December 2024 relative to their peak in January 2023. \nFee Related Earnings \nFee Related Earnings were $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $113.3 million, compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease of $90.8 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues and an increase of $55.3 million in Other Operating Expenses, partially offset by an increase of $31.9 million in Management Fees, Net. \nFee Related Performance Revenues were $203.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $90.8 million, compared to $294.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower Fee Related Performance Revenues in BPP and \nco-investment\n and BXMT. \nOther Operating Expenses were $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $55.3 million, compared to $325.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher \nsub-servicing\n fees and professional fees. \nManagement Fees, Net were $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $31.9 million, compared to $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in Transaction and Other Fees, Net, partially offset by a decrease in Base Management Fees. Transaction and Other Fees, Net increased $96.5 million primarily due to an increase in acquisition fees paid to the advisor of our BREP funds. Base Management Fees decreased $77.2 million primarily due to a decrease in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BREIT. \n \n116 \nTable of Contents\nNet Realizations \nNet Realizations were $114.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $14.2 million, compared to $128.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to a decrease of $43.4 million in Realized Performance Revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $22.3 million in Realized Performance Compensation. \nRealized Performance Revenues were $201.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $43.4 million, compared to $244.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower Realized Performance Revenues in BREP. \nRealized Performance Compensation was $101.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $22.3 million, compared to $123.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Realized Performance Revenues. \nFund Returns \nFund return information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

As of December 31, 2024, BREP VII, BREP VI, BREP V, BREP Europe VI, BREP Europe IV, BREP Europe III and BREP Asia I were above their carried interest thresholds (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would have been above their carried interest thresholds even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. BREP IX, BREP VIII, BREP Europe V, BREDS IV and BREDS III were above their carried interest thresholds as of December 31, 2024, and BREP Asia II was below its carried interest threshold. Funds are considered above their carried interest thresholds based on the aggregate fund position, although individual limited partners may be below their respective carried interest thresholds in

$744.9 million, compared to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to an increase of $769.5 million in Fee Related Earnings, partially offset by a decrease of $24.6 million in Net Realizations. \nOur Private Equity segment demonstrated resilience across all strategies in 2024. In addition to particular strength in Corporate Private Equity and Life Sciences, our Infrastructure business was a notable driver of Fee Related Performance Revenues in the fourth quarter due to a significant scheduled crystallization event. We continue to believe our Infrastructure business is well positioned to benefit from the expected increase in demand for investment in infrastructure, including digital infrastructure, over time. In Corporate Private Equity, our operating companies saw stable revenue growth and margin expansion during the year. Realization activity in the segment meaningfully increased toward the end of 2024, concentrated in Corporate Private Equity, and we see a more constructive environment for realizations in the segment through the course of 2025. Improved market sentiment has created positive momentum for deployment in the segment, which nearly doubled year-over-year, and for fundraising, including in our perpetual capital strategies. \nFee Related Earnings \nFee Related Earnings were $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $769.5 million, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $1.2 billion in Fee Related Performance Revenues and $190.7 million in Management and Advisory Fees, Net, partially offset by an increase of $544.6 million in Fee Related Compensation. \n \n119 \nTable of Contents\nFee Related Performance Revenues were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $1.2 billion, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to crystallization of performance revenues in BIP and BXPE. \nManagement and Advisory Fees, Net were $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $190.7 million, compared to $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by increases in Base Management Fees and Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net. Base Management Fees increased $123.9 million primarily due to an increase in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BIP and BXPE, as well as the investment period commencement and subsequent fee holiday expirations of BCP IX and BETP IV. Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net increased $67.6 million primarily due to increased volume of deal activity in BXCM. \nFee Related Compensation were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $544.6 million, compared to $619.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in Fee Related Performance Revenues and Management and Advisory Fees, Net, both of which impact Fee Related Compensation. \nNet Realizations \nNet Realizations were $811.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $24.6 million, compared to $835.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Net Realizations was attributable to an increase of $49.3 million in Realized Performance Compensation and a decrease of $23.9 million in Realized Principal Investment Income, partially offset by an increase of $48.6 million in Realized Performance Revenues. \nRealized Performance Compensation was $633.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $49.3 million, compared to $584.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in Realized Performance Compensation in Corporate Private Equity and Tactical Opportunities, partially offset by decreases in Secondaries. \nRealized Principal Investment Income was $52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $23.9 million, compared to $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in Realized Principal Investment Income in Corporate Private Equity. \nRealized Performance Revenues were $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $48.6 million, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in Realized Performance Revenues in Tactical Opportunities and Corporate Private Equity, partially offset by decreases in Secondaries. \nFund Returns \nFund returns information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

Class I Total Net Return is presented on an annualized basis from January 2, 2024. \nFunds With Closed Investment Periods as of December 31, 2024 \nThe Corporate Private Equity funds have eleven funds with closed investment periods: BCP IV, BCP V, BCP VI, BCP VII, BCP VIII, BCOM, BEP I, BEP II, BEP III, BCEP I and BCP Asia I. As of December 31, 2024, BCP IV was above its carried interest threshold (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would still be above its carried interest threshold even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. BCP V is comprised of two fund classes, the BCP V “main fund” and \nBCP V-AC\n fund. Within these fund classes, the general partner is subject to equalization such that (a) the general partner accrues carried interest when the respective carried interest for either fund class is positive and (b) the general partner realizes carried interest so long as clawback obligations, if any, for either of the respective fund classes are fully satisfied. BCP V, BCP VI, BCP VII, BCP VIII, BCOM, BEP I, BEP II, BEP III, BCEP I and BCP Asia I were above their respective carried interest thresholds. Funds are considered above their carried interest thresholds based on the aggregate fund position, although individual limited partners may be below their respective carried interest thresholds in certain funds. \nTactical Opportunities funds have various funds with closed investment periods, including but not limited to: \nBTOF-POOL,\n \nBTOF-POOL II,\n and \nBTOF-POOL III,\n which are each above their carried interest thresholds based on aggregate fund position. Blackstone Growth funds have no funds with closed investment periods. Secondaries funds have various funds with closed investment periods, including but not limited to: Strategic Partners Infrastructure III, Strategic Partners VIII, Strategic Partners Real Estate VII and BSCH I which are above their respective carried interest thresholds based on aggregate fund position. Blackstone Life Sciences funds have one fund with a closed investment period: Clarus IV, which was above its carried interest threshold. \n \n122 \nTable of Contents\nCredit & Insurance \nThe

$275.4 million, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of $251.4 million in Fee Related Earnings and $24.0 million in Net Realizations. \nOur Credit & Insurance segment demonstrated consistently strong performance in 2024. Longer-term structural shifts in the lending market have contributed to attractive and sizeable deployment opportunities in the segment, which invested $63.8 billion in 2024. Credit & Insurance funds have benefited from an environment of high interest rates, although these rates began to decrease in 2024. A further decline in interest rates and/or widening of credit spreads would make it more difficult for our credit funds to replicate recent strong performance. Nevertheless, even with modest base rate decreases, we continue to see significant opportunities to generate excess returns relative to liquid markets in our \nnon-investment\n grade strategies. Moreover, rapidly expanding private credit markets and opportunities for corporate and bank partnerships should continue to be supportive of overall transaction activity, including deployment. \nFundraising in our Credit & Insurance segment, including in our perpetual capital strategies, continued to be positively impacted by the long-term structural shifts in the lending market. In addition to strong interest in \nnon-investment\n grade strategies, such as opportunistic and direct lending, and a meaningful increase in demand for investment grade private credit, we see robust momentum in our perpetual capital strategies. At the same time, given the significant opportunities in the space, competition in the private credit markets has increased and is likely to increase further as a result of product innovation and customization by private credit managers. In addition, regulatory measures aimed at reducing burden on U.S. banks, such as less onerous bank regulatory capital requirements, may also increase competition. \n \n123 \nTable of Contents\nFee Related Earnings \nFee Related Earnings were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $251.4 million, compared to $950.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $243.8 million in Management Fees, Net and $182.8 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $127.6 million in Fee Related Compensation. \nManagement Fees, Net were $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $243.8 million, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in Base Management Fees. Base Management Fees increased $264.2 million primarily due to an increase in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in direct lending. \nFee Related Performance Revenues were $747.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $182.8 million, compared to $564.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher net investment income and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BCRED. \nFee Related Compensation was $755.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $127.6 million, compared to $628.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in Management Fees, Net and Fee Related Performance Revenues, both of which impact Fee Related Compensation. \nNet Realizations \nNet Realizations were $223.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $24.0 million, compared to $199.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of $18.1 million in Realized Principal Investment Income, partially offset by a decrease of $10.4 million in Realized Performance Compensation. \nRealized Principal Investment Income was $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $18.1 million, compared to $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the impact of a realized loss related to the insurance platform in the year ended December 31, 2023. \nRealized Performance Compensation was $129.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $10.4 million, compared to $140.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Realized Performance Revenues. \nComposite Returns \nComposite returns information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

$192.2 million, compared to $315.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of $25.1 million in Fee Related Earnings and $167.1 million in Net Realizations. \nNearly all strategies across our Multi-Asset Investing segment exhibited positive performance in 2024, with significantly less volatility than the broader markets. In particular, the Absolute Return Composite had its nineteenth consecutive quarter of positive performance and best year since 2009, benefiting from performance across strategies, including quantitative, macro and equities. Segment Distributable Earnings in the Multi-Asset Investing segment would likely be negatively impacted, however, by a significant or sustained weak market environment or decline in asset prices, including as a result of concerns over macroeconomic factors. In addition, certain of our strategies are designed to benefit from a high interest rate environment. Declining interest rates may make it more difficult for these Multi-Asset Investing strategies to replicate their positive performance. Conversely, if interest rates remain at sustained high levels for an extended period, certain investors may seek to reallocate capital away from traditional Multi-Asset Investing strategies in favor of fixed income investments. Outperformance by our Multi-Asset Investing segment strategies in a weak market environment has in some cases resulted in such strategies representing an increasing portion of the value of certain investors’ portfolios, which may limit such investors’ ability to allocate additional capital to certain funds in the segment, or result in such investors seeking to withdraw capital from such funds. \nFee Related Earnings \nFee Related Earnings were $228.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $25.1 million, compared to $203.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease of $20.0 million in Fee Related Compensation. \n \n126 \nTable of Contents\nFee Related Compensation was $144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $20.0 million, compared to $164.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation accruals. \nNet Realizations \nNet Realizations were $279.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $167.1 million, compared to $112.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of $225.3 million in Realized Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $38.6 million in Realized Performance Compensation. \nRealized Performance Revenues were $380.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $225.3 million, compared to $155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher Realized Performance Revenues in Absolute Return. \nRealized Performance Compensation was $86.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $38.6 million, compared to $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in Realized Performance Revenues. \nComposite Returns \nComposite returns information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented. The composite returns information reflected in this discussion and analysis is not indicative of the financial performance of Blackstone and is also not necessarily indicative of the future results of any particular fund or composite. An investment in Blackstone is not an investment in any of our funds or composites.

The Absolute Return Composite includes only BXMA-managed commingled and customized multi-manager funds and accounts and does not include BXMA’s liquid solutions, seeding, Multi-Strategy, Harvest and advisory \n(non-discretionary)\n platforms, except for investments by Absolute Return funds directly into those platforms. BXMA-managed funds in liquidation and, in the case of net returns, \nnon-fee-paying\n assets are also excluded. The funds/accounts that comprise the Absolute Return Composite are not managed within a single fund or account and are managed with different mandates. There is no guarantee that BXMA would have made the same mix of investments in a stand-alone fund/account. The Absolute Return Composite is not an investible product and, as such, the performance of the Absolute Return Composite does not represent the performance of an actual fund or account. The historical return is from January 1, 2000. \n \n127 \nTable of Contents\nOperating Metrics \nThe following table presents information regarding our Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nInvested Performance\nEligible Assets Under\nManagement\n\n\n  \n\n\nEstimated % Above\nHigh Water\nMark/Benchmark (a)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n  \n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n2024\n\n\n  \n\n\n2023\n\n\n  \n\n\n2022\n\n\n  \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMulti-Asset Investing Managed Funds (b)\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n 51,630,740\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n 45,631,127\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n 43,052,178\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n98\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n95\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n82\n\n\n% \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nEstimated % Above High Water Mark/Benchmark represents the percentage of Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management that as of the dates presented would earn performance fees when the applicable Multi-Asset Investing managed fund has positive investment performance relative to a benchmark, where applicable.

Blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period. As a result, we require limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our businesses. We draw primarily on the long-term committed or invested capital of investors in our investment vehicles to fund the investment requirements of the Blackstone Funds and use our own realizations and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, make commitments to our own funds, where our minimum general partner commitments are generally less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of a fund, and pay dividends to stockholders and distributions to holders of Holdings Units. \nFluctuations in our statement of financial condition result primarily from activities of the Blackstone Funds that are consolidated as well as business transactions, such as the issuance of senior notes. The majority economic ownership interests of such consolidated Blackstone Funds are reflected as Redeemable \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities, and \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidation of these Blackstone Funds has no net effect on Blackstone’s Net Income or Equity. Additionally, fluctuations in our statement of financial condition also include appreciation or depreciation in Blackstone investments in the \nnon-consolidated\n Blackstone Funds, additional investments and redemptions of such interests in the \nnon-consolidated\n Blackstone Funds and the collection of receivables related to management and advisory fees. \n \n132 \nTable of Contents\nTotal Assets were $43.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $3.2 billion from December 31, 2023.

The increase in Total Liabilities was principally due to an increase of $2.6 billion in total liabilities attributable to consolidated operating partnerships, partially offset by a decrease of $866.0 million in total liabilities attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nThe increase in total liabilities attributable to consolidated operating partnerships was primarily due to increases of $839.9 million in Accrued Compensation and Benefits, $837.5 million in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities and $616.5 million in Loans Payable. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\no\n\n\nThe increase in Accrued Compensation and Benefits was primarily due to an increase in compensation-related accruals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\no\n\n\nThe increase in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities was primarily due to an increase in derivative liabilities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\no\n\n\nThe increase in Loans Payable was primarily due to the issuance of senior notes during the quarter ended December 31, 2024. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nThe decrease in total liabilities attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds was primarily due to decreases of $599.6 million in Loans Payable and $322.4 million in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, which were primarily due to the deconsolidation of two CLOs during the year ended December 31, 2024. \nSources and Uses of Liquidity \nOn December 6, 2024, Blackstone, through its indirect subsidiary Blackstone Reg Finance Co. L.L.C., issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due December 6, 2034 pursuant to a Registration Statement on \nForm S-3.\n For additional information see Note 12. “Borrowings” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing and “— Notable Transactions”. \nWe have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in our businesses, the proceeds from our issuances of senior notes and other borrowings, liquid investments we hold on our balance sheet and access to our $4.325 billion committed revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). As of December 31, 2024, Blackstone had $2.0 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents, $1.1 billion invested in Corporate Treasury Investments and $5.8 billion in Other Investments (which included $5.3 billion of liquid investments), against $11.3 billion in borrowings from our bond issuances, and no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. In February 2025, we drew $900.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. \n \n133 \nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the cash we receive from our notes offerings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and other borrowings, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) Performance Revenue realizations, and (c) realizations on the fund investments that we make. The amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. Our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. Therefore, Blackstone’s commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position. \nWe expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which includes, without limitation, funding our general partner and \nco-investment\n commitments to our funds and warehousing investments for our funds, (b) provide capital for business expansion, (c) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, and other obligations as they arise, including servicing debts, (d) pay income taxes and (e) pay dividends to our stockholders, make distributions to the holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units and make repurchases under our share repurchase program.

expect our commitments to be drawn down over time and to be funded by available cash and cash generated from operations and realizations. Taking into account prevailing market conditions and both the liquidity and cash or liquid investment balances, we believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be more than sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. Additionally, for some of the general partner commitments shown in the table above, we require our senior managing directors and certain other professionals to fund a portion of the commitment even though the ultimate obligation to fund the aggregate commitment is ours pursuant to the governing agreements of the respective funds. The amounts of the aggregate applicable general partner original and remaining commitment are shown in the table above. Remaining commitment may exceed original commitment due to recallable capital. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nIncludes the full portion of our commitments (1) required to be funded by senior managing directors and certain other professionals and (2) that are elected by such individuals to be funded for the life of a fund, where such fund permits such election. Excludes amounts that are elected by such individuals to be funded on an annual basis and certain de minimis commitments funded by such individuals in certain carry funds. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nRepresents capital commitments to a number of other funds in each respective segment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nRepresents loan origination commitments, revolver commitments and capital market commitments. \nFor a tabular presentation of the timing of Blackstone’s remaining capital commitments to our funds, the funds we invest in and our investment strategies see “— Contractual Obligations”. \nBorrowings \nAs of December 31, 2024, Blackstone Holdings Finance Co.

The Notes contain customary covenants and financial restrictions that, among other things, limit the Issuers and the guarantors’ ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The Notes also contain customary events of default. All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the Notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the Notes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe Registered 2034 Notes’ Guarantors and Issuer, Blackstone Reg Finance Co.

(collectively, the “Obligor Group”) do not have material assets, liabilities and results of operations, with the exception of certain amounts already disclosed in our consolidated financial statements (specifically, goodwill, the majority of our deferred tax assets, the Tax Receivable Agreement liability and the Registered 2034 Notes). Therefore, we have excluded the summarized financial information for the Obligor Group due to management’s belief that such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide material information to investors.

Financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio and a requirement to keep a minimum amount of \nfee-earning\n assets under management, each tested quarterly. \nFor a tabular presentation of the payment timing of principal and interest due on Blackstone’s issued notes and the Revolving Credit Facility see “— Contractual Obligations”. \nContractual Obligations \nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024 on a consolidated basis and on a basis deconsolidating the Blackstone Funds: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContractual Obligations\n\n\n  \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n2026-2027\n\n\n \n\n\n2028-2029\n\n\n \n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n\n\n\n\nOperating Lease Obligations (a)\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n180,493\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n367,948\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n380,512\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n919,296\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,848,249\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPurchase Obligations\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n126,174\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n148,459\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,991\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n976\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n295,600\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBlackstone Operating Borrowings (b)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n318,843\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,538,876\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,285,330\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,217,700\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,360,749\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterest on Blackstone Operating Borrowings (c)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n422,762\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n825,184\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n714,130\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,368,535\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,330,611\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBorrowings of Consolidated Blackstone Funds\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n99,419\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n99,419\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterest on Borrowings of Consolidated Blackstone Funds\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15,662\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15,662\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,032\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45,356\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBlackstone Funds Capital Commitments to Investee Funds (d)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n127,215\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n127,215\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDue to Certain \nNon-Controlling\n Interest Holders in Connection with Tax Receivable Agreements (e)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n43,954\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n205,716\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n252,970\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,342,197\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,844,837\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits, Including Interest and Penalties (f)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBlackstone Operating Entities Capital Commitments to Blackstone Funds and Other (g)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n6,379,912\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,379,912\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Contractual Obligations\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n7,599,353\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,101,845\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,668,595\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,962,155\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27,331,948\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBorrowings of Consolidated Blackstone Funds\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(99,419\n\n\n) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(99,419\n\n\n) \n\n\n\n\nInterest on Borrowings of Consolidated Blackstone Funds\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(15,662\n\n\n) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(15,662\n\n\n) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(14,032\n\n\n) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(45,356\n\n\n) \n\n\n\n\nBlackstone Funds Capital Commitments to Investee Funds (d)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n(127,215\n\n\n) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(127,215\n\n\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBlackstone Operating Entities Contractual Obligations\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,472,138\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,086,183\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,652,933\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n13,848,704\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n27,059,958\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nWe lease our primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2043. Occupancy lease agreements, in addition to contractual rent payments, generally include additional payments for certain costs incurred by the landlord, such as building expenses and utilities. To the extent these are fixed or determinable they are included in the table above. The table above includes operating leases that are recognized as Operating Lease Liabilities, short-term leases that are not recorded as Operating Lease Liabilities and leases that have been signed but not yet commenced which are not recorded as Operating Lease Liabilities. The amounts in this table are presented net of contractual sublease commitments. \n \n139 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nRepresents the principal amounts due on our senior notes and secured borrowings. For our senior notes, we assume no \npre-payments\n and the borrowings are held until their final maturity. For our secured borrowings we project prepayments based on the performance of the underlying assets and principal may be paid down in full prior to their stated maturity. As of December 31, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. In February 2025, we drew $900.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nRepresents interest to be paid over the maturity of our senior notes and secured borrowings. For our senior notes, we assume no \npre-payments\n and the borrowings are held until their final maturity. For our secured borrowings, we project \npre-payments\n based on the performance of the underlying assets with interest payments based on the estimated principal outstanding, inclusive of projected \npre-payments.\n These amounts include commitment fees for unutilized borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nThese obligations represent commitments of the consolidated Blackstone Funds to make capital contributions to investee funds and portfolio companies. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nRepresents obligations by Blackstone’s corporate subsidiary to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements to certain \nnon-controlling\n interest holders for the tax savings realized from the taxable purchases of their interests in connection with the reorganization at the time of Blackstone’s IPO in 2007 and subsequent purchases. The obligation represents the amount of the payments currently expected to be made, which are dependent on the tax savings actually realized as determined annually without discounting for the timing of the payments. As required by GAAP, the amount of the obligation included in the consolidated financial statements and shown in Note 17. “Related Party Transactions” (see “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”) differs to reflect the net present value of the payments due to certain \nnon-controlling\n interest holders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nBlackstone is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with gross unrecognized benefits of $250.9 million and interest of $87.3 million as of December 31, 2024; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nThese obligations represent commitments by us to provide general partner capital funding to the Blackstone Funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and Blackstone principal investment commitments. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category; however, a substantial amount of the capital commitments are expected to be called over the next three years. We expect to continue to make these general partner capital commitments as we raise additional amounts for our investment funds over time. \nGuarantees \nBlackstone and certain of its consolidated funds provide financial guarantees. The amounts and nature of these guarantees are described in Note 18. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Guarantees” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. \nIndemnifications \nIn many of its service contracts, Blackstone agrees to indemnify the third-party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the above contractual obligations table or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024. \n \n140 \nTable of Contents\n \nClawback Obligations \nPerformance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceed the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. The amounts and nature of Blackstone’s clawback obligations are described in Note 18. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Contingent Obligations (Clawback)” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. \nShare Repurchase Program \nOn July 16, 2024, Blackstone’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. This authorization replaced Blackstone’s prior $2.0 billion repurchase authorization. Under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual number repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Blackstone repurchased 4.0 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $520.4 million. As of December 31, 2024, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was $1.8 billion. \nDividends \nOur intention is to pay to holders of common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85% of Blackstone Inc.’s share of Distributable Earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as \ntax-related\n payments, clawback obligations and dividends to stockholders for any ensuing quarter. The dividend amount could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter. \nFor Blackstone’s definition of Distributable Earnings, see “—Key Financial Measures and Indicators.” \nAll of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce such quarterly dividends or even to eliminate such dividends entirely. \nBecause \nthe publicly traded entity and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreements, the amounts ultimately paid as dividends by Blackstone to common stockholders in respect of each fiscal year are generally expected to be less, on a per share or per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships to the Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships in respect of their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. \nDividends are treated as qualified dividends to the extent of Blackstone’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, with any excess dividends treated as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s basis. \nThe following graph shows fiscal quarterly and annual per common stockholder dividends for 2024, 2023 and 2022. Dividends are declared and paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which they are earned. \n \n141 \nTable of Contents\n\n\nWith respect to fiscal year 2024, we paid to stockholders of our common stock a dividend of $0.83, $0.82, $0.86 and $1.44 per share in respect of the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, aggregating to $3.95 per share of common stock. With respect to fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we paid stockholders of our common stock aggregate dividends of $3.35 per share and $4.40 per share, respectively. \nLeverage \nWe may under certain circumstances use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for Blackstone and our stockholders. In addition to the borrowings from our note issuances and our revolving credit facility, we may use asset based financing arrangements, including but not limited to, margin loans, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. Reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. Repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. The balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on Blackstone’s liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles. \nThe following table presents information regarding these financial instruments which are included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition: \n \n142 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nRepurchase\nAgreements\n\n\n  \n\n\nSecurities\nSold, Not Yet\nPurchased\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Dollars in Millions)\n\n\n\n\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Daily Balance\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n56.8\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMaximum Daily Balance\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n268.5\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n \nCritical Accounting Policies \nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective. Actual results may be affected negatively based on changing circumstances. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. For a description of our accounting policies, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. \nPrinciples of Consolidation \nFor a description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Consolidation” and Note 8. “Variable Interest Entities” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for detailed information on Blackstone’s involvement with VIEs. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. \nThe determination that Blackstone holds a controlling financial interest in a Blackstone Fund or investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. In our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position included in this filing, we present 100% of the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs along with a \nnon-controlling\n interest which represents the portion of the consolidated vehicle’s interests held by third parties. However, assets of our consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE and are not available for general use by Blackstone. Further, the liabilities of our consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of Blackstone. In the Consolidated Statements of Operations, we eliminate any management fees, Incentive Fees, or Performance Allocations received or accrued from consolidated VIEs as they are considered intercompany transactions. We recognize 100% of the consolidated VIE’s investment income (loss) and allocate the portion of that income (loss) attributable to third-party ownership to \nnon-controlling\n interests in arriving at Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc. \nThe assessment of whether we consolidate a Blackstone Fund or investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. These judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with the VIE and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nDetermining whether our management fees, Incentive Fees or Performance Allocations represent variable interests — We make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. In making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third-party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the VIE. \n \n143 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nDetermining whether \nkick-out\n rights are substantive — We make judgments as to whether the third-party investors in a partnership entity have the ability to remove the general partner, the investment manager or its equivalent, or to dissolve (liquidate) the partnership entity, through a simple majority vote. This includes an evaluation of whether barriers to exercise these rights exist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nConcluding whether Blackstone has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE — As there is no explicit threshold in GAAP to define “potentially significant,” management must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met. \nRevenue Recognition \nFor a description of our accounting policy on revenue recognition, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Revenue Recognition” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For an additional description of the nature of our revenue arrangements, including how management fees, Incentive Fees, and Performance Allocations are generated, please refer to “Part I. Item 1. Business — Fee Structure/Incentive Arrangements.” The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of revenue recognition principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. \nManagement and Advisory Fees, Net\n — Blackstone earns base management fees from its customers at a fixed percentage of a calculation base. The range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows: \nFor vehicles within the Real Estate segment: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.35% to 1.50% of committed capital or invested capital during the investment period or subsequent to the investment period, respectively, for certain drawdown vehicles and \nco-investment\n vehicles, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.40% to 1.25% of net asset value for other vehicles, including separately managed accounts, certain perpetual capital vehicles, drawdown vehicles, and \nco-investment\n vehicles, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n1.50% of BXMT’s net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated “distributable earnings” (which is generally equal to its GAAP net income excluding certain \nnon-cash\n and other items), subject to certain adjustments. \nFor vehicles within the Private Equity segment: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.40% to 1.75% of committed capital during the investment period or invested capital or gross investment value subsequent to the investment period for drawdown vehicles and certain \nco-investment\n vehicles, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.50% to 1.75% of invested capital for separately managed accounts and certain \nco-investment\n vehicles, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.75% to 1.25% of net asset value for perpetual capital vehicles. \nFor vehicles within the Credit & Insurance segment: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.20% to 1.25% of net asset value or fair value of investments for certain separately managed accounts and open-ended vehicles, \n \n144 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.35% to 1.25% of net asset value or gross asset value of our BDCs and certain registered investment companies, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.20% to 0.50% of the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, for CLO vehicles, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.20% to 1.50% of invested capital for drawdown vehicles and certain separately managed accounts. \nFor vehicles within the Multi-Asset Investing segment: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.20% to 1.50% of net asset value for all vehicles. \nManagement fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital are mechanical in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. Management fee calculations based on net asset value, gross asset value, or investment fair value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. See “ — Fair Value” below for further discussion of the judgment required for determining the fair value of the underlying investments. \nInvestment Income (Loss)\n — Performance Allocations are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. Blackstone has concluded that investments made alongside its limited partners in a partnership which entitle Blackstone to a Performance Allocation represent equity method investments that are not in the scope of the GAAP guidance on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers. Blackstone accounts for these arrangements under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, Blackstone’s share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. Under the HLBV method, at the end of each reporting period Blackstone calculates the accrued Performance Allocations that would be due to Blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results. \nThe change in the fair value of the investments held by certain Blackstone Funds is a significant input into the accrued Performance Allocation calculation and accrual for potential repayment of previously received Performance Allocations. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. See “ — Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments. \nFair Value \nBlackstone uses fair value throughout the reporting process. For a description of our accounting policies related to valuation, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Fair Value of Financial Instruments” and “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Investments, at Fair Value” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of fair value principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. \nThe fair value of the investments held by Blackstone Funds is the primary input to the calculation of certain of our management fees, Incentive Fees, Performance Allocations and the related Compensation we recognize. Generally, Blackstone Funds are accounted for in accordance with the GAAP guidance on investment companies, and under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide, \nInvestment \n \n \n145 \nTable of Contents\n \nCompanies\n, and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments, at fair value. In the absence of observable market prices, we utilize valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis and assumptions that we believe market participants would use to determine the fair value of the investments. For investments where little market activity exists management’s determination of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances, which may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, and the consideration of a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for \nnon-performance\n and liquidity risks. \nBlackstone has also elected the fair value option for certain instruments it owns directly, including loans and receivables, investments in private debt securities and other proprietary investments. Blackstone is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value, including debt instruments, equity securities and freestanding derivatives. \nFair Value of Investments or Instruments that are Publicly Traded \nSecurities that are publicly traded and for which a quoted market exists will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market on the valuation date. When a quoted price in an active market exists, no block discounts or control premiums are permitted regardless of the size of the public security held. In some cases, securities will include legal and contractual restrictions limiting their purchase and sale for a period of time. A discount to the publicly traded price may be appropriate in instances where a legal restriction is a characteristic of the security, such as may be required under SEC Rule 144. The amount of the discount, if taken, shall be determined based on the time period that must pass before the restricted security becomes unrestricted or otherwise available for sale. \nFair Value of Investments or Instruments that are not Publicly Traded \nInvestments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity or debt of operating companies or real estate properties. Our primary methodology for determining the fair values of such investments is generally the income approach which provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business, security, or property is expected to generate in the future. The most widely used methodology under the income approach is the discounted cash flow method which includes significant assumptions about the underlying investment’s projected net earnings or cash flows, discount rate, capitalization rate and exit multiple. Our secondary methodology, generally used to corroborate the results of the income approach, is typically the market approach. The most widely used methodology under the market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions, or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions, or assets are comparable. Depending on the facts and circumstances associated with the investment, different primary and secondary methodologies may be used including option value, contingent claims or scenario analysis, yield analysis, projected cash flow through maturity or expiration, discount to sale, probability weighted methods or recent round of financing. \nIn certain cases debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. \n \n146 \nTable of Contents\nManagement Process on Fair Value \nDue to the importance of fair value throughout the consolidated financial statements and the significant judgment required to be applied in arriving at those fair values, we have developed a process around valuation that incorporates several levels of approval and review from both internal and external sources. Investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are valued on at least a quarterly basis by our internal valuation or asset management teams, which are independent from our investment teams. For investments held by vehicles managed by more than one business unit, Blackstone has developed a process designed to facilitate coordination and alignment, as appropriate, of the fair value of \nin-scope\n investments across business units. \nFor investments valued utilizing the income method and where Blackstone has information rights, we generally have a direct line of communication with each of the companies’ and underlying assets’ finance teams and collect financial data used to support projections used in a discounted cash flow analysis. The valuation team then analyzes the data received and updates the valuation models reflecting any changes in the underlying cash flow projections, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiple or capitalization rate, and any other valuation input relevant to economic conditions. \nThe results of all valuations of investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are reviewed by the relevant business unit’s valuation \nsub-committee,\n which is comprised of key personnel from the business unit, typically the chief investment officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer (or their respective equivalents where applicable) and other senior managing directors in the business. To further corroborate results, each business unit also generally obtains either a positive assurance opinion or a range of value from an independent valuation party, at least annually for internally prepared valuations for investments that have been held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles for greater than a year and quarterly for certain investments. Our firmwide valuation committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and comprised of senior members of our businesses and representatives from corporate functions, including legal and finance, reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. Each quarter, the valuation process is also reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of our \nnon-employee\n directors. \nIncome Tax \nFor a description of our accounting policy on taxes and additional information on taxes see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 14. “Income Taxes,” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. \nOur provision for income taxes is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. \nAdditionally, significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including any valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. In evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that Blackstone uses to manage its business. To the extent any portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. \nRevisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. \n \n147 \nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Developments \nInformation regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on Blackstone, if any, can be found in Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem 7A.\n\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \nOur predominant exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment adviser to the Blackstone Funds and the sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, including the effect on management fees, performance revenues and investment income. See “Part I. — Item 1. Business — Investment Process and Risk Management.” \nEffect on Fund Management Fees \nBlackstone earns base management fees from its customers at a fixed percentage of a calculation base. For a description of our accounting policy on revenue recognition and management fee calculation bases, generally, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Revenue Recognition” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Management fees will only be directly affected by short-term changes in market conditions to the extent they are based on NAV, gross asset value (“GAV”), or represent permanent impairments of value. These management fees will be increased (or reduced) in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of our investments in the related funds. The proportion of our management fees that are based on NAV or GAV is dependent on the number and types of Blackstone Funds, vehicles, or separately managed accounts in existence and the current stage of each fund’s life cycle. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the percentages of our fund management fees based on the NAV or GAV of the applicable funds or separately managed accounts, were as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n\n\nFund Management Fees Based on the NAV or GAV of the Applicable Funds or Separately Managed Accounts\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n% \nMarket Risk \nThe Blackstone Funds hold investments which are reported at fair value and Blackstone invests directly in securities measured at fair value. Based on the fair value as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimate that a 10% decline in the fair value of investments, excluding equity securities without a readily determinable fair value measured in accordance with the measurement alternative, and certain freestanding derivative instruments would result in the following declines in Management and Advisory Fees, Net, Unrealized Performance Allocations, Net and Unrealized Principal Investment Income: \n \n148 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n2024\n\n\n  \n\n\n2023\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nManagement\nand Advisory\nFees, Net (a)\n\n\n  \n\n\nUnrealized\nPerformance\nAllocations,\nNet (b)\n\n\n  \n\n\nUnrealized\nPrincipal\nInvestment\nIncome (c)\n\n\n  \n\n\nManagement\nand Advisory\nFees, Net (a)\n\n\n  \n\n\nUnrealized\nPerformance\nAllocations,\nNet (b)\n\n\n  \n\n\nUnrealized\nPrincipal\nInvestment\nIncome (c)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n\n\n\n\n10% Decline in Fair Value of the Investments\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n424,575\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,399,495\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n802,964\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n392,340\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,172,376\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n835,037\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nRepresents the annualized effect of the 10% decline. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nRepresents the reporting date effect of the 10% decline.

We invest in people. We hire qualified people, train them, encourage them to provide their best thinking to the firm for the benefit of the investors in the funds we manage, and compensate them in a manner designed to retain and motivate them and align their interests with those of the investors in our funds and our stockholders. \nOur overriding compensation philosophy for our senior managing directors and certain other employees is that compensation should be composed primarily of (a) annual cash bonus payments tied to Blackstone’s overall performance and the performance of the applicable business unit(s) in which such employee works, (b) performance interests (composed primarily of Performance Allocations, commonly referred to as carried interest, and incentive fee interests) tied to the performance of the investments made by the funds in the business unit in which such employee works or for which he or she has responsibility, and (c) deferred equity awards reflecting the value of our common stock. We believe that the appropriate combination of annual cash bonus payments and performance interests and/or deferred equity awards encourages our senior managing directors and other employees to focus on the underlying performance of our investment funds, as well as the overall performance of the firm and interests of our stockholders, and that base salary should represent a significantly lesser component of total compensation. \nWe believe that the proportion of compensation that is “at risk” should increase as an employee’s level of responsibility rises. Base salary generally represents a smaller percentage of the total compensation of employees at higher total compensation levels compared to employees at lower total compensation levels. Employees at higher total compensation levels are generally targeted to receive a greater percentage of their total compensation in the form of participation in performance interests, deferred equity awards and, to a lesser extent, annual cash bonuses subject to deferral. \nOur compensation program includes significant elements that discourage excessive risk-taking and align the compensation of our employees with the long-term performance of the firm. For example, for accounting purposes we accrue compensation for the Performance Plans (as defined below) related to our carry funds as increases in the carrying value of the portfolio investments are recorded in those carry funds. Notwithstanding this fact, we only make cash payments to our employees related to carried interest when profitable investments have been realized and cash is distributed first to the investors in our funds, followed by the firm and only then to employees of the firm. Moreover, if a carry fund fails to achieve specified investment returns due to diminished performance of later investments, our Performance Plans entitle us to “claw back” carried interest payments previously made to an employee for the benefit of the limited partner investors in that fund, and we escrow a portion of all carried interest payments made to employees to help fund their potential future “clawback” obligations, all of which further discourages excessive risk-taking by our employees. Similarly, for our investment funds that pay incentive fees, those incentive fees are only paid to the firm and employees of the firm to the extent an applicable fund’s portfolio of investments has profitably appreciated in value (in most cases above a specified level) during the applicable period. In addition, and as noted below with respect to our named executive officers, requiring our professional employees to invest in certain of the funds they manage directly aligns the interests of our professionals and our fund investors. In most cases, the carried interest earned on these investments represents a significant percentage of such professional employees’ \nafter-tax\n compensation. Lastly, because our equity awards have significant vesting or deferral provisions, the actual amount of compensation realized by the recipient is tied directly to the long-term performance of our common stock. In applicable jurisdictions, specifically in the European Union and the United Kingdom, our compensation program includes additional remuneration policies that may limit or otherwise alter the compensation for certain employees, consistent with local regulatory requirements, and are aimed at, among other things, discouraging inappropriate risk-taking and aligning compensation with the firm’s strategy and long-term interests, consistent with our general compensation program. \nWe believe our current compensation and benefit offerings for senior professionals are best in class and are consistent with companies in the alternative asset management industry. We generally do not rely on compensation surveys or compensation consultants. Our senior management periodically reviews the effectiveness and competitiveness of our compensation program, and such reviews may in the future involve the assistance of independent consultants. \n \n237 \nTable of Contents\n \nPersonal Investment Obligations\n. As part of our compensation philosophy and program, we require our named executive officers to invest their own capital in and alongside the funds that we manage. We believe that this strengthens the alignment of interests between our named executive officers and the investors in those investment funds. See “—Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence — Investment In or Alongside Our Funds.” In determining compensation for our named executive officers, we do not take into account the gains or losses attributable to the personal investments by our named executive officers in our investment funds. \nMinimum Retained Ownership Requirements\n. We believe the continued ownership by our named executive officers of significant amounts of our equity affords significant alignment of interests with our stockholders. For equity awards granted in 2019 and onward (other than grants made under our Bonus Deferral Plan), our named executive officers are required to hold 25% of their vested equity for two years after the applicable vesting event. If the named executive officer’s employment terminates prior to such time, however, such 25% of the vested equity must be held for two years after termination of employment. The minimum retained ownership requirements for our named executive officers are further described below under “— Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 — Terms of Discretionary Equity Awards — Minimum Retained Ownership Requirements.” \nNamed Executive Officers \nIn 2024, our named executive officers were: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive\n\n\n  \n\n\nTitle\n\n\n\n\nStephen A. Schwarzman\n\n\n  \n\n\nCo-Founder,\n Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\n\n  \n\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer\n\n\n\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\n\n  \n\n\nVice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nJohn G. Finley\n\n\n  \n\n\nChief Legal Officer\n\n\n\n\nVikrant Sawhney\n\n\n  \n\n\nChief Administrative Officer and Global Head of Institutional Client Solutions\nCompensation Elements for Named Executive Officers \nThe key elements of the compensation of our named executive officers for 2024 were base compensation, which is composed of base salary, cash bonus and equity-based compensation, and performance compensation, which is composed of carried interest and incentive fee allocations: \n1. \nBase Salary\n. Each named executive officer received a $350,000 annual base salary in 2024, which equals the total yearly partnership drawings that were received by each of our senior managing directors prior to our initial public offering in 2007. In keeping with historical practice, we continue to pay this amount as a base salary. \n2. \nAnnual Bonus Payments / Deferred Equity Awards\n. Since our initial public offering, Mr. Schwarzman has not received any cash compensation other than the $350,000 annual salary described above and the actual realized carried interest distributions or incentive fees he may receive in respect of his participation in the carried interest or incentive fees earned from our funds through our Performance Plans described below. We believe that having Mr. Schwarzman’s compensation largely based on ownership of a portion of the carried interest or incentive fees earned from our funds aligns his interests with those of the investors in our funds and our stockholders. \nEach of our named executive officers other than Mr. Schwarzman received annual bonus payments in respect of 2024 in addition to their base salary. These bonus payments included participation interests in the earnings of the firm’s various investment businesses. For all named executive officers, the amount of bonus payments paid to such named executive officer at the end of the year in respect of such year was determined in the discretion of Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Gray, as described below. Earnings for the firm’s investment businesses are calculated based on the annual operating income of the businesses and are generally a function of the performance of the businesses, which is evaluated by Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Gray. The ultimate bonus payment amounts were \n \n238 \nTable of Contents\nbased on (a) the prior and anticipated performance of the named executive officer, (b) the prior and anticipated performance of the firm’s segments and product lines, (c) the overall success of the firm and (d) where applicable, the estimated participation interests given to the named executive officer at the beginning of the year in respect of the investments to be made in that year. We make annual bonus payments in the first quarter of the ensuing year to reward individual performance for the prior year. The ultimate bonus payments that are made are fully discretionary as further discussed below under “— Determination of Incentive Compensation.” \nFor 2024, all named executive officers other than Mr. Schwarzman were selected to participate in the Bonus Deferral Plan. The Bonus Deferral Plan provides for the deferral of a portion of each participant’s annual cash bonus payment. Except as otherwise determined by the Plan Administrator (as defined in the Bonus Deferral Plan), the amount of each participant’s annual cash bonus payment deferred under the Bonus Deferral Plan is calculated pursuant to a deferral rate table using the participant’s total annual incentive compensation, which generally includes such participant’s annual cash bonus payment and a portion of any incentive fees earned in connection with our investment funds and is subject to certain adjustments, including reductions for mandatory contributions to our investment funds. By deferring a portion of a participant’s compensation, the Bonus Deferral Plan acts as an employment retention mechanism and thereby enhances the alignment of interests between such participant and the firm. Many publicly traded asset managers utilize deferred compensation plans as a means of retaining and motivating their professionals, and we believe that it is in the interest of our stockholders to do the same for our personnel. \nOn January 10, 2025, Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney each received a deferral award under the Bonus Deferral Plan of deferred restricted common stock units in respect of their service in 2024. The percentage of the 2024 annual cash bonus payment mandatorily deferred into deferred restricted common stock units for Messrs. Gray, Chae, Finley and Sawhney was approximately 100%, 100%, 40% and 100%, respectively. These awards are reflected as stock awards for fiscal year 2024 in the Summary Compensation Table and in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 table. \n3. \nDiscretionary Equity Awards\n. On April 1, 2024, Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney were awarded a discretionary award of 197,896, 79,159, 71,243 and 71,243 deferred restricted common stock units, respectively. These awards reflected 2023 performance and were intended to further promote retention and to incentivize future performance. The awards were granted under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan. The awards will vest 10% on July 1, 2025, 10% on July 1, 2026, 20% on July 1, 2027, 30% on July 1, 2028 and 30% on July 1, 2029. These awards are reflected as stock awards for fiscal 2024 in the Summary Compensation Table and in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 table. \nIn January 2025, Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney were each informed of anticipated discretionary awards of deferred restricted common stock units with values of $30,000,000, $15,000,000, $15,000,000 and $12,750,000, respectively. These anticipated awards reflect 2024 performance and are intended to further promote retention and to incentivize future performance. These awards are expected to be granted under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan on April 1, 2025, subject to the named executive officer’s continued employment through such date. Once granted, these awards will vest 10% on July 1, 2026, 10% on July 1, 2027, 20% on July 1, 2028, 30% on July 1, 2029 and 30% on July 1, 2030 and will be reflected as stock awards for fiscal 2025 in the Summary Compensation Table and in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2025 table. \n4. \nParticipation in Carried Interest and Incentive Fees\n. During 2024, all of our named executive officers participated in the carried interest and/or the incentive fees of our funds through their participation interests in the carry or incentive fee pools generated by these funds. The carry or incentive fee pool with respect to each fund in a given year is funded by a fixed percentage of the total amount of carried interest or incentive fees earned by Blackstone for such fund in that year. We refer to these pools and employee participation therein as our “Performance Plans” and payments made thereunder as “performance payments.” The aggregate amount of performance payments payable through our Performance Plans is directly tied to the performance of the funds, which we believe benefits our stockholders by fostering a strong alignment of interests between the investors in those funds and the named executive officers. In addition, most alternative asset managers, including several of our competitors, use participation in carried interest or incentive fees as a central means of compensating and motivating their professionals, and we must do the same in order to attract and retain the most qualified personnel. For purposes of our financial statements, we treat the income allocated to all our personnel who have participation interests in the carried interest or incentive fees generated by our funds as compensation, and the amounts of carried interest and \n \n239 \nTable of Contents\n \nincentive fees earned by named executive officers are reflected as “All Other Compensation” in the Summary Compensation Table. Distributions in respect of our Performance Plans for each named executive officer are determined on the basis of the percentage participation in the relevant investments previously allocated to that named executive officer, which percentage participations are established in January of each year in respect of the investments to be made in that year. The percentage participation for a named executive officer may vary from year to year and fund to fund due to several factors, which may include changes in the size and composition of the pool of Blackstone personnel participating in such Performance Plan in a given year, the performance of our various businesses, new developments in our businesses and product lines, and the named executive officer’s leadership and oversight of the function for which the named executive officer is responsible and such named executive officer’s contributions with respect to our strategic initiatives. In addition, certain of our employees, including our named executive officers, may participate in profit sharing initiatives whereby these individuals may receive allocations of investment income from Blackstone’s firm investments. Our employees, including our named executive officers, may also receive equity awards in our investment advisory clients and/or be allocated securities of such clients that we have received. \n(a) \nCarried Interest\n. Distributions of carried interest in cash (or, in some cases, \nin-kind)\n to our named executive officers and other employees who participate in our Performance Plans relating to our carry funds depends on the realized proceeds and timing of the cash realizations of the investments owned by the carry funds in which they participate. Our carry fund agreements also set forth specified preconditions to a carried interest distribution, which typically include that there must have been a positive return on the relevant investment and that the fund must be above its carried interest hurdle rate. In addition, as described below, employees or senior managing directors may also be required to have fulfilled specified service requirements to be eligible to receive carried interest distributions. For our carry funds, carried interest distributions for the named executive officer’s participation interests are generally made to the named executive officer following the actual realization of the investment, although a portion of such carried interest is held back by the firm in respect of any future “clawback” obligation related to the fund. In allocating participation interests in the carry pools, we have not historically taken into account or based such allocations on any prior or projected triggering of any “clawback” obligation related to any fund. To the extent any “clawback” obligation were to be triggered for a fund, carried interest previously distributed to a named executive officer would have to be returned to the limited partners of such fund, thereby reducing the named executive officer’s overall compensation for any such year. Moreover, because a carried interest recipient (including Blackstone itself) may have to fund more than its respective share of a “clawback” obligation under the governing documents (generally, up to an additional 67%), the compensation paid to a named executive officer for any given year could be significantly reduced or even negative in the event a “clawback” obligation were to arise. \nParticipation in carried interest generated by our carry funds for all named executive officers other than Mr. Schwarzman is subject to vesting. Vesting serves as an employment retention mechanism and thereby enhances the alignment of interests between a participant in our Performance Plans and the firm. Carried interest generally vests in equal installments on the first through fourth anniversary of the closing of the investment to which it relates (unless an investment is realized prior to the expiration of such four-year anniversary, in which case an active named executive officer is deemed 100% vested in the proceeds of such realizations). In addition, any named executive officer who is Tier I or Tier II retirement eligible (as defined below) will automatically vest in 50% of their otherwise unvested carried interest allocation upon retirement. We believe that vesting requirements of carried interest participation enhances the stability of our senior management team and provides greater incentives for our named executive officers to remain at the firm. Due to his unique status as a \nco-founder\n and the longtime chief executive officer of our firm, Mr. Schwarzman vests in 100% of his carried interest participation related to any investment by a carry fund upon the closing of that investment. \n(b) \nIncentive Fees\n. Cash distributions of incentive fees to our named executive officers and other employees who participate in our Performance Plans relating to the funds that pay incentive fees depend on the performance of the investments owned by those funds in which they participate. For our investment funds that pay incentive fees, those incentive fees are only paid to the firm and employees of the firm to the extent an applicable fund’s portfolio of investments has profitably appreciated in value (in most cases above a specified level) during the applicable period and following the calculation of the profit split (if any) between the fund’s general partner or investment adviser and the fund’s investors. \n(c) \nInvestment Advisory Client Interests\n. BXMT is an investment advisory client of Blackstone. Compensation we receive from investment advisory clients in the form of securities may be allocated to employees \n \n240 \nTable of Contents\nand senior managing directors. In 2024, Messrs. Schwarzman, Gray, Chae, Finley and Sawhney were allocated restricted shares of listed common stock of BXMT in connection with investment advisory services provided by Blackstone to BXMT. The value of these allocated shares is reflected as “All Other Compensation” in the Summary Compensation Table. \n5. \nOther Benefits\n. Upon the consummation of our initial public offering in June 2007, we entered into a founding member agreement with our \nco-founder,\n Mr. Schwarzman, which provides (as subsequently amended) specified benefits to him following his retirement. (See “— Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 —Schwarzman Founding Member Agreement.”) Mr. Schwarzman is provided certain security services, which may include home security systems and monitoring, and personal and related security services. These security services are provided for our benefit, and we consider the related expenses to be appropriate business expenses rather than personal benefits for Mr. Schwarzman. Nevertheless, the expenses associated with these security services are reflected in the “All Other Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table below to the extent the aggregate amount of all perquisites or other personal benefits received exceeded $10,000. \nDetermination of Incentive Compensation \nMr. Schwarzman reserves final approval of each named executive officer’s compensation, other than his own, and receives recommendations from Mr. Gray on such compensation determinations (other than with respect to Mr. Gray’s own compensation). Mr. Schwarzman’s compensation has been established pursuant to the terms of his amended and restated founding member agreement, which is described below under “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 — Schwarzman Founding Member Agreement.” For 2024, these decisions were based primarily on Mr. Schwarzman’s and Mr. Gray’s assessment of such named executive officer’s individual performance, operational performance for the areas of the business for which the named executive officer has responsibility, and the named executive officer’s potential to enhance investment returns for the investors in our funds and service to our investment advisory clients, and to contribute to long-term stockholder value. In evaluating these factors, Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Gray relied upon their judgment to determine the ultimate amount of a named executive officer’s annual cash bonus payment and participation in carried interest, incentive fees and investment advisory client interests that was necessary to properly induce the named executive officer to seek to achieve our objectives and reward a named executive officer in achieving those objectives over the course of the prior year. Key factors that Mr. Schwarzman considered in making such determination with respect to Mr. Gray were his service as President and Chief Operating Officer, his role in overseeing the growth and operations of the firm, and his leadership on the strategic direction of the firm. Key factors that Messrs. Schwarzman and Gray considered in making such determinations with respect to Mr. Chae were his leadership and oversight of our global finance, treasury, technology and corporate development functions and his role in strategic initiatives undertaken by the firm. Key factors that Messrs. Schwarzman and Gray considered in making such determinations with respect to Mr. Finley were his leadership and oversight of our global legal and compliance functions, his role in positioning the firm to be compliant with and responsive to evolving legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us and our investment businesses, and his role in strategic initiatives undertaken by the firm. Key factors that Messrs. Schwarzman and Gray considered in making such determinations with respect to Mr. Sawhney were his leadership and oversight of our global institutional and private client relationships, his role in overseeing aspects of the firm’s operations and his role in strategic initiatives undertaken by the firm. For 2024, Messrs. Schwarzman and Gray also considered Blackstone’s overall performance and each named executive officer’s prior year annual cash bonus payments, the named executive officers’ allocated share of performance interests through participation in our Performance Plans, the appropriate balance between incentives for long-term and short-term performance, and the compensation paid to the named executive officer’s peers within the firm. The actual cash bonus amounts awarded based on these considerations, net of the portion of Mr. Gray’s, Mr. Chae’s, Mr. Finley’s and Mr. Sawhney’s bonus mandatorily deferred into deferred restricted common stock units pursuant to the Bonus Deferral Plan, are reflected in the “Bonus” column of the Summary Compensation Table below. \nPolicies and Practices Related to the Timing of Equity Awards \nOur executive compensation program has historically not included awards of stock options. Accordingly, we have no policy, program, practice, or plan pertaining to the timing of stock option grants with respect to the release of material \nnon-public\n information. We also have not timed the release of material \nnon-public\n information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation. \n \n241 \nTable of Contents\n \nCompensation Committee Report \nThe compensation committee of the board of directors has reviewed and discussed with management the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis and, based on such review and discussion, has determined that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis should be included in this annual report. \nStephen A. Schwarzman \nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation \nDuring 2024, our compensation committee was comprised of Mr. Schwarzman, and none of our executive officers served as a director or member of the compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity whose executive officers served on our compensation committee or our board of directors. For a description of certain transactions between us and Mr. Schwarzman, see “—Item 13.

The grant date fair value of these equity awards is computed in accordance with GAAP and generally differs from the dollar amount of such awards.

Any \nin-kind\n distributions in respect of carried interest are reported based on the market value of the securities distributed as of the date of distribution. For 2024, no named executive officers received such \nin-kind\n distributions. We have determined to present compensation relating to carried interest and incentive fees within the Summary Compensation Table in the year in which such \n \n243 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncompensation is paid to the named executive officer under the terms of the relevant Performance Plan. Accordingly, the amounts presented in the table differ from the compensation expense recorded by us on an accrual basis for such year in respect of carried interest and incentive fees allocable to a named executive officer, which accrued amounts for 2024 are separately disclosed in this footnote to the Summary Compensation Table. We believe that the presentation of the amounts of carried interest- and incentive \nfee-related\n compensation paid to a named executive officer during the year, instead of the amounts of compensation expense we have recorded on an accrual basis, most appropriately reflects the actual compensation received by the named executive officer and represents the amount most directly aligned with the named executive officer’s performance. By contrast, the amount of compensation expense accrued in respect of carried interest and incentive fees allocable to a named executive officer can be highly volatile from year to year, with amounts accrued in one year being reversed in a following year, and vice versa, causing such amounts to be less useful as a measure of the compensation earned by a named executive officer in any particular year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTo the extent compensation expense recorded by us on an accrual basis in respect of carried interest or incentive fee allocations (rather than cash or \nin-kind\n distributions) were to be included for 2024, the amounts would be $130,489,569 for Mr. Schwarzman, $55,624,994 for Mr. Gray, $9,776,156 for Mr. Chae, $3,882,981 for Mr. Finley and $15,824,232 for Mr. Sawhney. For financial statement reporting purposes, the accrual of compensation expense is equal to the amount of carried interest and incentive fees related to performance fee revenues as of the last day of the relevant period as if the performance fee revenues in the funds generating such carried interest or incentive fees were realized as of the last day of the relevant period. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmounts shown for 2024 also include the value of restricted shares of listed common stock of BXMT allocated to our named executive officers based on the closing price of BXMT’s common stock on the date of the award as follows: $789,606 for Mr. Schwarzman, $831,607 for Mr. Gray, $87,353 for Mr. Chae, $34,941 for Mr. Finley and 87,353 for Mr. Sawhney. These restricted BXMT shares will vest over three years with \none-sixth\n of the shares vesting at the end of the second quarter after the date of the award and the remaining shares vesting in ten equal quarterly installments thereafter. With the exception of $11,030,216 of expenses related to security services in 2024 for Mr. Schwarzman and members of his family, there were no perquisites or other personal benefits provided to the other named executive officers for which the aggregate incremental cost to the Company exceeded $10,000, and information regarding any such perquisites or other personal benefits has therefore not been included. As noted above under “— Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Compensation Elements for Named Executive Officers — Other Benefits,” we consider the expenses for security services for Mr. Schwarzman to be for our benefit and appropriate business expenses rather than personal benefits for Mr. Schwarzman. Mr. Schwarzman makes business and personal use of a car and driver and he and members of his family may also make occasional business and personal use of an airplane in which we have a fractional interest. In each case, he bears the full cost of such personal usage. In addition, certain Blackstone personnel administer personal matters for Mr. Schwarzman and members of his family and certain matters for the Stephen A. Schwarzman Education Foundation (“SASEF”) and the Stephen A. Schwarzman Foundation (“SASF”), and Mr. Schwarzman, SASEF and SASF, as applicable, respectively, bear the full incremental cost to us of such personnel, if any. There is no incremental expense incurred by us in connection with the use of any car and driver, airplane or personnel by Mr. Schwarzman, as described above. \nGrants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 \nThe following table provides information concerning equity awards granted in 2024 or, for deferred restricted common stock units granted under the Bonus Deferral Plan or on the same terms as the deferred bonus awards under the Bonus Deferral Plan, with respect to 2024, to our named executive officers: \n \n244 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n  \n\n\nGrant Date\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nAll Other Stock\nAwards:\nNumber of\nShares of Stock\nor Units\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGrant Date Fair\nValue of Stock\nand Option\nAwards\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nStephen A.

The 981,883 deferred restricted Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units granted to Mr. Chae in 2016 vested annually in substantially equal installments over six years beginning on July 1, 2019. The 708,601, 47,241, 47,241 and 9,449 deferred restricted Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units granted in 2019 to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney, respectively, vested 20% on July 1, 2022, 30% on July 1, 2023 and 50% on July 1, 2024. The 757,217, 216,348, 108,174 and 216,348 deferred restricted common stock units granted in 2020 to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney, respectively, vested 10% on July 1, 2021, 10% on July 1, 2022, 20% on July 1, 2023 and 30% on July 1, 2024, and will vest 30% on July 1, 2025. The 533,628, 105,322, 91,279 and 119,365 deferred restricted common stock units granted in 2021 to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney, respectively, vested 10% on July 1, 2022, 10% on July 1, 2023, 20% on July 1, 2024, and will vest 30% on July 1, 2025 and 30% on July 1, 2026. The 314,747, 86,970, 74,546 and 76,202 deferred restricted common stock units granted in 2022 to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney, respectively, vested 10% on July 1, 2023, 10% on July 1, 2024, and will vest 20% on July 1, 2025, 30% on July 1, 2026 and 30% on July 1, 2027. The 349,191, 116,397, 104,758 and 104,758 deferred restricted common stock units granted in 2023 to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney, respectively, vested 10% on July 1, 2024, and will vest 10% on July 1, 2025, 20% on July 1, 2026, 30% on July 1, 2027 and 30% on July 1, 2028. The 197,896, 79,159, 71,243 and 71,243 deferred restricted common stock units granted in 2024 to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney, respectively, will vest 10% on July 1, 2025, 10% on July 1, 2026, 20% on July 1, 2027, 30% on July 1, 2028 and 30% on July 1, 2029. \nExcept as described below, unvested discretionary equity awards are generally forfeited upon termination of employment. With respect to Mr. Gray, the deferred restricted common stock units granted to him in 2020 and subsequent years will become fully vested if he is terminated by us without cause. In addition, upon the death or permanent disability of a named executive officer, all unvested discretionary equity awards of common stock units held at that time will vest immediately. In connection with a named executive officer’s termination of employment due to a Tier I qualifying retirement or a Tier II qualifying retirement, 50% or 100% of such units, respectively, will continue to vest and be delivered over the vesting period, subject to forfeiture if the named executive officer violates any applicable provision of his employment agreement or engages in any competitive activity (as such term is defined in the applicable award agreement). Blackstone personnel are deemed Tier I retirement eligible upon reaching the age of 55 and having at least five full years of service with our firm, and the sum of his or her age plus years of service with our firm totals at least 65. Upon the effectiveness of the Tier II Retirement Amendment (defined below), Blackstone personnel will be deemed Tier II retirement eligible upon reaching the age of 60 and having at least ten full years of service with our firm. Further, in the event of a change in control (defined in the Blackstone Holdings partnership agreements as the occurrence of any person, other than Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. or a person approved by Blackstone Group Management L.L.C., becoming the Series II Preferred Stockholder), all unvested discretionary equity awards will automatically be deemed vested as of immediately prior to such change in control. \n \n245 \nTable of Contents\n \nAll vested and unvested equity awards (and our common stock delivered upon vesting or received in exchange for Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units) held by a named executive officer will be immediately forfeited in the event the named executive officer materially breaches any of their restrictive covenants set forth in the \nnon-competition\n and \nnon-solicitation\n agreement outlined under \n“Non-Competition\n and \nNon-Solicitation\n Agreements” or their service is terminated for cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. Schwarzman will not be required to forfeit more than 25% of the units held by him as of March 1, 2018, the date of his amended and restated founding member agreement. \nCash Dividend Equivalents\n. All discretionary equity awards are entitled to the payment of current cash dividend equivalents. In accordance with the SEC’s rules, the current cash dividend equivalents are not required to be reported in the Summary Compensation Table because the amounts of future cash dividends are factored into the grant date fair value of the awards. \nMinimum Retained Ownership Requirements\n. For units granted in 2014 and prior years (other than grants made under our Bonus Deferral Plan), while employed by us and generally for one year following the termination of employment, our named executive officers (except as otherwise provided below) are required to hold at least 25% of all vested equity received by such named executive officer; provided that with respect to vested equity received in connection with the reorganization we effected prior to our initial public offering, such percentage is reduced to 12.5% upon a Tier I or Tier II qualifying retirement. For equity granted in 2015 through 2018 (other than grants made under our Bonus Deferral Plan) our named executive officers (except as otherwise provided below) are required to hold 25% of their vested equity until the earlier of (1) ten years after the applicable vesting date and (2) one year following termination of employment. For equity awards granted in 2019 and onward (other than grants made under our Bonus Deferral Plan), our named executive officers (except as otherwise provided below) are required to hold 25% of their vested equity for two years after the applicable vesting event. If the named executive officer’s employment terminates prior to such time, however, such 25% of the vested equity must be held for two years after termination of employment. The requirement that one continue to hold such minimum amounts of vested equity is subject to the qualification in Mr. Schwarzman’s case that in no event will he be required to hold equity having a market value greater than $1.5 billion or hold equity following termination of employment. Each of our named executive officers is in compliance with these minimum retained ownership requirements. \nTransfer Restrictions\n. None of our named executive officers may transfer Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units other than pursuant to transactions or programs approved by us. \nThis transfer restriction applies to sales and pledges of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units, grants of options, rights or warrants to purchase Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units or swaps or other arrangements that transfer to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units other than as approved by us. We will generally approve pledges or transfers to personal planning vehicles beneficially owned by the families of our \npre-IPO\n owners and charitable gifts, provided that the pledgee, transferee or donee agrees to be subject to the same transfer restrictions. Transfers to Blackstone are also exempt from the transfer restrictions. \nTerms of Deferred Restricted Common Stock Units Granted Under the Bonus Deferral Plan \nIn 2007, we established our Bonus Deferral Plan for certain eligible employees in order to provide such eligible employees with a \npre-tax\n deferred incentive compensation opportunity and to enhance the alignment of interests between such eligible employees and Blackstone. The Bonus Deferral Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified Bonus Deferral Plan which provides for the automatic, mandatory deferral of a portion of each participant’s annual cash bonus payment. \nAt the end of each year, the Plan Administrator selects plan participants in its sole discretion and notifies such individuals that they have been selected to participate in the Bonus Deferral Plan for such year. Participation is mandatory for those employees selected by the Plan Administrator to be participants. An individual who is not so selected may not elect to participate in the Bonus Deferral Plan. The selection of participants is made on an annual basis; an individual selected to participate in the Bonus Deferral Plan for a given year may \n \n246 \nTable of Contents\nnot necessarily be selected to participate in a subsequent year. For 2024, all employees other than Mr. Schwarzman, who received no bonus in respect of 2024, were selected to participate in the Bonus Deferral Plan, with the deferred amount (if any) determined in accordance with the table described below or as otherwise determined in the discretion of the Plan Administrator. For fiscal 2024, the Plan Administrator determined that 100% of the annual cash bonus payment for each of Messrs. Gray, Chae and Sawhney would be deferred. \nIn respect of the deferred portion of his or her annual cash bonus payment, each participant receives deferral units which represent rights to receive in the future a specified amount of common stock units under our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, subject to vesting provisions described below. The amount of each participant’s annual cash bonus payment deferred under the Bonus Deferral Plan is calculated pursuant to a deferral rate table using the participant’s total annual incentive compensation, which generally includes such participant’s annual cash bonus payment and a portion of any incentive fees earned in connection with our investment funds, and is subject to certain adjustments, including reductions for mandatory contributions to our investment funds. For deferrals of annual cash bonus payments, the deferral percentage was calculated on the basis set forth in the following table (or such other table that may be adopted by the Plan Administrator). \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortion of Annual Incentive\n\n\n  \n\n\nMarginal\nDeferral Rate\nApplicable to\nSuch Portion\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEffective\nDeferral Rate for\nEntire Annual\nBonus (a)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n$0—100,000\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.0\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n$100,001—200,000\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.5\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n$200,001—500,000\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15.0\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n$500,001—750,000\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20.0\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n$750,001—1,250,000\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28.0\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n$1,250,001—2,000,000\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34.4\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n$2,000,001—3,000,000\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39.6\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n$3,000,001—4,000,000\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n43.4\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n$4,000,001—5,000,000\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46.8\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n$5,000,000 +\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n65\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n52.8\n\n\n% \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nEffective deferral rates are shown for illustrative purposes only and are based on an annual cash payment equal to the maximum amount in the range shown in the far left column (which is assumed to be $7,500,000 for the last range shown). \nMandatory Deferral Awards\n. Generally, deferral units are satisfied by delivery of shares of our common stock in equal annual installments over a three-year deferral period. Delivery of shares of our common stock underlying vested deferral units is generally made during open trading window periods to facilitate the participant’s liquidity to meet tax obligations. If the participant’s employment is terminated for cause, the participant’s undelivered deferral units (vested and unvested) will be immediately forfeited. Upon a change in control or termination of the participant’s employment because of death, any undelivered deferral units (vested and unvested) will become immediately deliverable. Unvested bonus deferral awards will be forfeited upon resignation, will immediately vest and be delivered if the participant’s employment is terminated without cause or because of disability and, in connection with a Tier I or Tier II qualifying retirement, will continue to vest and be delivered over the applicable deferral period, subject to forfeiture if the participant violates any applicable provision of his or her employment agreement or engages in any competitive activity (as such term is defined in the Bonus Deferral Plan). \nThe 105,312, 28,797, 23,663 and 12,074 deferred restricted common stock granted to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney, respectively, in 2022 for 2021 performance vested \none-third\n on January 1, 2023, \none-third\n on January 1, 2024 and \none-third\n on January 1, 2025. The 176,874, 42,730, 34,307 and 57,250 deferred restricted common stock granted to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney, respectively, in 2023 for 2022 performance vested \none-third\n on January 1, 2024, \none-third\n on January 1, 2025, and will vest \none-third\n on January 1, 2026. The 55,837, 15,564, 17,280 and 8,753 deferred restricted common stock granted to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney, respectively, in 2024 for 2023 performance vested \none-third\n on January 1, 2025, and will vest \none-third\n on \n \n247 \nTable of Contents\n \nJanuary 1, 2026 and \none-third\n on January 1, 2027. The 41,801, 33,604, 12,388 and 24,042 deferred restricted common stock granted to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney, respectively, in 2025 for 2024 performance will vest \none-third\n on January 1, 2026, \none-third\n on January 1, 2027 and \none-third\n on January 1, 2028. \nSchwarzman Founding Member Agreement \nUpon the consummation of our initial public offering, we entered into a founding member agreement with Mr. Schwarzman. On March 1, 2018, we amended and restated this agreement, with the approval of a committee of independent directors advised by independent counsel, to address certain retirement benefits to be received by Mr. Schwarzman. Mr. Schwarzman’s agreement provides that he will remain our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (or, as determined by Mr. Schwarzman, our Chairman or Executive Chairman) while continuing service with us and requires him to give us six months’ prior written notice of intent to terminate service with us. The agreement provides that following retirement (or, if applicable, the date on which he ceases active service as a result of his permanent disability), Mr. Schwarzman will be provided with specified retirement benefits for the remainder of his life, including that he be permitted to retain his then current office and continue to be provided with administrative support, access to office services and a car and driver. Mr. Schwarzman will also continue to receive health benefits following his retirement until his death, subject to his continuing payment of the related health insurance premiums consistent with current policies. Finally, Mr. Schwarzman will also receive reimbursement for travel costs (including travel on personal aircraft) for Blackstone related business functions, annual home and personal security benefits, reasonable access to our Chief Legal Officer, reasonable access to certain events, legal representation for Blackstone related matters, and, subject to his continuing payment of costs and expenses related thereto, he will continue to be provided with offices, technology and support for his family office team at levels consistent with current practice. \nThe agreement provides that, following Mr. Schwarzman’s termination of service, he or related entities will remain entitled to receive awards of carried interest at reduced levels until the later of February 14, 2027 or the date of Mr. Schwarzman’s death. The profit sharing percentage for any carried interest awarded in new funds launched after Mr. Schwarzman’s termination of service shall generally be set at 50% of the profit sharing percentage Mr. Schwarzman held in the most recent corresponding predecessor fund prior to his termination of employment or, in the case of new funds without a corresponding predecessor fund prior to Mr. Schwarzman’s termination of service, a profit sharing percentage set at 50% of the median of the aggregate profit sharing percentages held by Mr. Schwarzman at the time of his termination of service. \nWhile currently Mr. Schwarzman is entitled to invest in or alongside our investment funds without being subject to management fees or carried interest, this has been extended to continue until ten years following the date of Mr. Schwarzman’s death as to Mr. Schwarzman, his estate and related entities. \nOn July 1, 2019, in connection with Blackstone’s conversion from a limited partnership to a corporation and with the approval of the conflicts committee advised by independent counsel, we amended this agreement to address the ongoing compensation to be received by Mr. Schwarzman. Pursuant to the amended agreement, Mr. Schwarzman is entitled to distributions and benefits in amounts and at levels that are consistent with current practices. In addition, the amended agreement provides that, prior to Mr. Schwarzman’s termination of service, the profit sharing percentage for any carried interest in new funds in which there is a corresponding predecessor fund shall be set at the same profit sharing percentage he or related entities held in the most recent such predecessor fund and, in the case where there is no such predecessor fund, the profit sharing percentage shall be set at the median profit sharing percentage owned by him or related entities across all funds existing at the time in question. In connection with the amended agreement, Mr. Schwarzman informed the former conflicts committee of our board of directors that he has no current plan to retire. \nSenior Managing Director Agreements \nWe have entered into substantially similar senior managing director agreements with each of our named executive officers and other senior managing directors, other than our founder. The agreements generally provide that each senior managing director will devote substantially all of his or her business time, skill, energies and attention to us in a diligent manner. Each senior managing director will be \n \n248 \nTable of Contents\npaid distributions and receive benefits in amounts determined by Blackstone from time to time in its sole discretion. The agreements require us to provide the senior managing director with 90 days’ prior written notice prior to terminating his or her service with us (other than a termination for cause). Additionally, the agreements with our named executive officers require each senior managing director to give us 90 days’ prior written notice of intent to terminate service with us and include terms under which the senior managing director may be placed on a \n90-day\n period of “garden leave” following the senior managing director’s termination of service (as further described under the caption “— \nNon-Competition\n and \nNon-Solicitation\n Agreements” below). \nOutstanding Equity Awards at 2024 Fiscal Year End \nThe following table provides information regarding outstanding unvested equity awards made to our named executive officers as of December 31, 2024. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nStock Awards (a)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n  \n\n\nNumber of Shares\nor Units of Stock\nThat Have Not\nVested\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nMarket Value of\nShares or Units of\nStock That Have\nNot Vested (b)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nStephen A.

Chae and Finley as discretionary equity awards and (2) 87,253 and 60,427 deferred restricted common stock units, respectively, granted to Messrs. Chae and Finley pursuant to the Bonus Deferral Plan, which are considered vested and undelivered for financial statement reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP pertaining to equity-based compensation due to the Tier I retirement eligibility of Messrs. Chae and Finley as of December 31, 2024. Upon retirement the deferred restricted common stock units are scheduled to be delivered in equal annual installments over the three-year deferral period, in each case subject to forfeiture if the named executive officer violates any applicable provision of his employment agreement or engages in any competitive activity (as such term is defined in the applicable award agreement or the Bonus Deferral Plan, as applicable). \nOption Exercises and Stock Vested in 2024 \nThe following table provides information regarding the number of outstanding initially unvested equity awards made to our named executive officers that vested during 2024: \n \n249 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nStock Awards (a)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n  \n\n\nNumber of Shares\nAcquired on\nVesting\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nValue Realized\non Vesting (b)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nStephen A.

Had such a change of control or such a termination of employment occurred on December 31, 2024, the last business day of 2024, each of our continuing named executive officers would have vested in the following numbers of deferred restricted common stock units, having the following values based on our closing market price of $172.42 per share of common stock on December 31, 2024, other than the deferred restricted common stock units granted to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney in 2025 in respect of 2024 performance, which are valued as of the date of their grant: Mr. Schwarzman had no outstanding unvested equity at December 31, 2024; Mr. Gray —1,561,967 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $268,997,917, Mr. Chae —468,845 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $80,583,873, Mr. Finley — 372,811 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $64,186,295, and Mr. Sawhney —437,999 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $75,337,790. In addition, the Bonus Deferral Plan provides that upon a change in control or termination of the participant’s employment because of death, any fully vested but undelivered deferred restricted common stock units will become immediately deliverable. \nIn connection with a named executive officer’s termination of employment due to a Tier I qualifying retirement, 50% of their unvested discretionary equity awards will continue to vest and be delivered over the vesting period and any unvested deferred restricted common stock units granted under the Bonus Deferral Plan will vest and be delivered in equal annual installments over the three year deferral period, in each case subject to forfeiture if the named executive officer violates any applicable provision of his employment agreement or engages in any competitive activity (as such term is defined in the applicable award agreement or the Bonus Deferral Plan, as applicable). As of December 31, 2024, Messrs. Chae and Finley were Tier I retirement eligible. If Mr. Chae or Mr. Finley had retired on December 31, 2024, 190,796 and 156,192 of their deferred restricted common stock units granted as discretionary awards, respectively, would continue to vest and be delivered over the vesting period and 87,253 and 60,427 of their deferred restricted common stock units granted under the Bonus Deferral Plan, respectively, would vest and be delivered over the three year deferral period, in each case subject to forfeiture if the named executive officer violates any applicable provision of his employment agreement or engages in any competitive activity (as such term is defined in the applicable award agreement or the Bonus Deferral Plan, as applicable). \nOn February 26, 2025, the Compensation Committee approved an Omnibus Amendment to the Company’s equity award agreements covering the Company’s outstanding discretionary equity awards, effective as of April 1, 2025 (the “Tier II Retirement Amendment”). The Tier II Retirement Amendment provides that participants who satisfy certain Tier II retirement eligibility criteria will \n \n250 \nTable of Contents\nbe eligible to vest in 100% of their unvested discretionary equity awards over the applicable vesting period, subject to forfeiture if the named executive officer violates any applicable provision of his employment agreement or engages in any competitive activity. If such amendment had been in effect on December 31, 2024, Mr. Finley would have satisfied such Tier II retirement eligibility criteria. Accordingly, upon retirement on such date, Mr. Finley would have been entitled to (i) continued vesting and delivery of 312,384 of his deferred restricted common stock units granted as discretionary awards and (ii) vesting and delivery over the three year deferral period of 60,427 of his deferred restricted common stock units granted under the Bonus Deferral Plan, in each case subject to forfeiture if he violates any applicable provision of his employment agreement or engages in any competitive activity. \nUpon a termination of Mr. Gray’s, Mr. Chae’s, Mr. Finley’s or Mr. Sawhney’s employment without cause, the deferred restricted common stock units granted to each of them under the Bonus Deferral Plan in respect of 2024, 2023 and 2022, as applicable, will become fully vested. Had such a termination of employment occurred on December 31, 2024, the last business day of 2024, each of Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney would have vested in the following numbers of deferred restricted common stock units, respectively, having the following values based on our closing market price of $172.42 per share of common stock on December 31, 2024, other than the deferred restricted common stock units granted to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney in 2025 in respect of 2024 performance, which are valued as of the date of their grant: Mr. Gray — 250,658 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $42,902,020, Mr. Chae — 87,253 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $14,789,780, Mr. Finley — 60,427 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $10,325,046 and Mr. Sawhney — 74,986 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $12,747,088. \nUpon a termination of Mr. Gray’s employment without cause, the deferred restricted common stock units granted to him on April 1, 2020, April 1, 2021, April 1, 2022, April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2024 will become fully vested. Had such a termination occurred on December 31, 2024, the last business day of 2024, Mr. Gray would have vested in 1,311,309 deferred restricted common stock units with a value of $226,095,898 based on our closing market price of $172.42 per share of our common stock on December 31, 2024. \nIn addition, except as described below, unvested carried interest in our carry funds is generally forfeited upon termination of employment. Upon the death or disability of any named executive officer who participates in the carried interest of our carry funds, the named executive officer will be deemed 100% vested in any unvested portion of carried interest in our carry funds. Furthermore, any named executive officer that is Tier I or Tier II retirement eligible will automatically vest in 50% of their otherwise unvested carried interest allocation upon retirement. In addition, pursuant to Mr. Schwarzman’s founding member agreement described above under “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 — Schwarzman Founding Member Agreement,” following retirement and for the remainder of his life, Mr. Schwarzman will be provided with specified retirement benefits, including a car and driver, retention of his current office, administrative support and annual home and personal security benefits. The value of such retirement benefits is estimated at approximately $13.0 million per year based on 2024 costs. We have not assigned a value to the entitlements of Mr. Schwarzman and his estate and related entities to receive carried interest in new funds or to invest in our investment funds fee free following his termination of service as such value cannot be reasonably estimated. We anticipate that any incremental cost to us with respect to the other personal benefits to which Mr. Schwarzman is entitled following his retirement will be de minimis. \nNon-Competition\n and \nNon-Solicitation\n Agreements \nUpon the consummation of our initial public offering, we entered into a \nnon-competition\n and \nnon-solicitation\n agreement with our founder, our other senior managing directors, and most of our other professional employees and specified senior administrative personnel. Senior managing directors and other personnel who joined the firm after our initial public offering have also executed similar restrictive covenant agreements, with the agreements covering \nnon-senior\n managing directors being subject to certain variations from the terms described below based on their respective positions and local law limitations. The following are descriptions of the material terms of the agreements covering senior managing directors. With the exception of the differences noted in the description below, the terms of each \nnon-competition\n and \nnon-solicitation\n agreement covering senior managing directors are generally in relevant part similar. \nFull-Time Commitment\n. Each senior managing director agrees to devote substantially all of their business time, skill, energies and attention to responsibilities at Blackstone in a diligent manner. Mr. Schwarzman has agreed that our business will be his principal business pursuit and that he will devote such time and attention to the business of the firm as may be reasonably requested by us. \n \n251 \nTable of Contents\n \nConfidentiality\n. Each senior managing director is required, whether during or after employment with us, to protect and use “confidential information” in accordance with strict restrictions placed by us on its use and disclosure. Every employee is subject to similar strict confidentiality obligations imposed by our Code of Conduct applicable to all Blackstone personnel. \nNotice of Termination\n. Each senior managing director is required to give us prior written notice of the intention to leave our employ — six months in the case of Mr. Schwarzman and 90 days for all of our other senior managing directors. In certain jurisdictions, the notice period as described in the preceding sentence is lengthened to include the potential garden leave period described below, in which case such notice and garden leave periods run concurrently. \nGarden Leave\n. Generally, upon voluntary departure from the firm, Blackstone has the right, but not the obligation, to place the senior managing director on a \n90-day\n period of “garden leave.” During this period the senior managing director will continue to receive base compensation and benefits but is prohibited from commencing employment with a new employer until the garden leave period has expired. The period of garden leave for each senior managing director will run concurrently with the \nnon-competition\n Restricted Period that applies as described below and, as noted above, may also run concurrently with the notice period in certain jurisdictions. Mr. Schwarzman is subject to \nnon-competition\n covenants but not garden leave requirements. \nNon-Competition\n. During the term of employment of each senior managing director, and during the Restricted Period (as such term is defined below) immediately thereafter, the senior managing director will not, directly or indirectly: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nengage in any business activity in which we operate, including any competitive business, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nrender any services to any competitive business, or \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nacquire a financial interest in or become actively involved with any competitive business (other than as a passive investor holding minimal percentages of the stock of public companies). \n“Competitive business” means any business that competes with our business, including any businesses that we are actively considering conducting at the time of the senior managing director’s termination of employment, so long as the senior managing director knows or reasonably should have known about such plans, in any geographical or market area where we or our affiliates conduct business or provide our products or services. \nNon-Solicitation\n. During the term of employment of each senior managing director, and during the Restricted Period immediately thereafter, the senior managing director will not, directly or indirectly, in any manner solicit any of our employees to leave their employment with us or hire any such employee who was employed by us as of the date of the senior managing director’s termination or who left employment with us within one year prior to or after the date of the senior managing director’s termination. Additionally, each senior managing director may not solicit or encourage to cease to work with us any consultant or senior advisers that the senior managing director knows or should know is under contract with us. \nIn addition, during the term of employment of each senior managing director, and during the Restricted Period immediately thereafter, the senior managing director will not, directly or indirectly, in any manner solicit the business of any client or prospective client of ours with whom the senior managing director, employees reporting to the senior managing director, or anyone whom the senior managing director had direct or indirect responsibility over had personal contact or dealings on our behalf during the three-year period immediately preceding the senior managing director’s termination. Senior managing directors who are employed in our asset management businesses are subject to a similar \nnon-solicitation\n covenant with respect to investors and prospective investors in our investment funds. \nNon-Interference\n and \nNon-Disparagement\n. During the term of employment of each senior managing director, and during the Restricted Period immediately thereafter, the senior managing director may not interfere with business relationships between us and any \n \n252 \nTable of Contents\nof our clients, customers, suppliers or partners. Each senior managing director is also prohibited from disparaging us in any way. However, such interference and disparagement prohibitions are subject to certain limitations as required by law. \nRestricted Period\n. For purposes of the foregoing covenants, the “Restricted Period” will generally be defined as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovenant\n\n\n  \n\n\nStephen A. Schwarzman\n\n\n  \n\n\nOther Senior Managing Directors\n\n\n\n\nNon-competition\n\n\n  \n\n\nTwo years after termination of employment.\n\n\n  \n\n\nOne year after termination of employment (or 90 days in the event of a termination without “cause”).\n\n\n\n\nNon-solicitation\n of Blackstone employees\n\n\n  \n\n\nTwo years after termination of employment.\n\n\n  \n\n\nTwo years after termination of employment.\n\n\n\n\nNon-solicitation\n of Blackstone clients or investors\n\n\n  \n\n\nTwo years after termination of employment.\n\n\n  \n\n\nOne year after termination of employment.\n\n\n\n\nNon-interference\n with business relationships\n\n\n  \n\n\nTwo years after termination of employment.\n\n\n  \n\n\nOne year after termination of employment.\nIntellectual Property\n. Each senior managing director is subject to customary intellectual property covenants with respect to works created, invented, designed or developed by such senior managing director that are relevant to or implicated by employment with us. \nSpecific Performance\n. In the case of any breach of the confidentiality, \nnon-competition,\n \nnon-solicitation,\n \nnon-interference,\n \nnon-disparagement\n or intellectual property provisions by a senior managing director, the breaching individual agrees that we will be entitled to seek equitable relief in the form of specific performance, restraining orders, injunctions or other equitable remedies (including forfeiture of the breaching individual’s vested and unvested interests in Blackstone). \nPay Ratio Disclosure \nAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation \nS-K,\n we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation for our principal executive officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (other than our principal executive officer) (the “CEO Pay Ratio”). Our CEO Pay Ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u). However, due to the flexibility afforded by Item 402(u) in calculating the CEO Pay Ratio, our CEO Pay Ratio may not be comparable to the CEO pay ratios presented by other companies. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 4,895 people, including our 254 senior managing directors. We identified our median employee using our global employee population as of December 31, 2024. To identify our median employee, we used annual base salary and bonuses earned in 2024. We believe this consistently applied compensation measure reasonably reflects annual compensation across our employee base. Application of our consistently applied compensation measure identified a group of employees with the same total annual base salary and cash bonus earned in 2024. We identified our median employee from among these employees by reviewing the components of their annual total compensation and selecting the employee whose title, tenure and compensation characteristics most accurately reflected the compensation of a typical employee. After identifying our median employee, we calculated the median employee’s annual total compensation in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table. For 2024, the annual total compensation for Mr. Schwarzman, our principal executive officer, was $84,027,074 and our median employee’s annual total compensation was $265,000. Accordingly, annual total compensation of our principal executive officer was approximately three hundred seventeen times the annual total compensation of our median employee. \nDirector Compensation in 2024 \nNo additional remuneration is paid to our employees for service on our board of directors. In 2024, each of our \nnon-employee\n directors received an annual cash retainer of $150,000 and a grant of deferred restricted common stock units equivalent in value to $210,000, with a grant date fair value determined as described in footnote (a) to the first table below. An additional $40,000 annual retainer was paid to the Chairman of the Audit Committee during 2024, $30,000 of which was paid in cash and the remainder of which was paid in the form of deferred restricted common stock units equivalent in value to $10,000 and with the same vesting terms as the other deferred restricted common stock units. The amounts of our \nnon-employee\n directors’ compensation were approved by our board of directors upon the recommendation of our founder following his review of directors’ compensation paid by comparable companies. \n \n253 \nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table provides the director compensation for our directors for 2024: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n  \n\n\nFees Earned or\nPaid in Cash\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nStock Awards\n(a) (b)\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nKelly A.

Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares “voting power,” which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or “investment power,” which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days of February 21, 2025. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed a beneficial owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed a beneficial owner of securities as to which he has no economic interest. Except as indicated by footnote, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all securities shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws where applicable. Unless otherwise included, for purposes of this table, the principal business address for each such person is c/o Blackstone Inc., 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nShares of Common Stock\nBeneficially Owned\n\n\n \n\n\nBlackstone Holdings\nPartnership Units\nBeneficially Owned (a)\n\n\n\n\nName of Beneficial Owner\n\n\n  \n\n\nNumber\n\n\n  \n\n\n% of\nClass\n\n\n \n\n\nNumber\n\n\n  \n\n\n% of\nClass\n\n\n\n\n5% Stockholders\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vanguard Group, Inc.

Our senior managing directors have agreed in the limited liability company agreement of Blackstone Partners L.L.C. that our founder, Mr. Schwarzman, will have the power to determine how the Series I preferred stock held by Blackstone Partners L.L.C. will be voted. Following the withdrawal, death or disability of Mr. Schwarzman (and any successor founder), this power will revert to the members of Blackstone Partners L.L.C. holding a majority in interest in that entity. The limited liability company agreement of Blackstone Partners L.L.C. provides that at such time as Mr. Schwarzman should cease to be a founding member, Jonathan D. Gray will thereupon succeed Mr. Schwarzman as the sole founding member of Blackstone Partners L.L.C. If Blackstone Partners L.L.C. directs us to do so, we will issue shares of Series I preferred stock to each of the limited partners of Blackstone Holdings, whereupon each holder of Series I preferred stock will be entitled to a number of votes that is equal to the number of vested and unvested Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units held by such Series I preferred stockholder on the relevant record date. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nThe Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units shown in the table above for such named executive officers and directors include: (a) the following units held for the benefit of family members with respect to which the named executive officer or director, as applicable, disclaims beneficial ownership: Mr. Schwarzman – 3,686,266 units held in various trusts for which Mr. Schwarzman is the investment trustee, Mr. Gray – 5,204,356 units held in a trust for which Mr. Gray is the investment trustee, Mr. Chae – 1,150,070 units held in a trust for which Mr. Chae is the investment trustee, Mr. Finley – 80,964 units held in a trust for which Mr. Finley is the investment trustee, Mr. Baratta – 142,237 units held in a trust for which Mr. Baratta is the investment trustee, and Mr. Sawhney 104,000 units held in a trust for which Mr. Sawhney is the investment trustee (b) the following units held in grantor retained annuity trusts for which the named executive officer or director, as applicable, is the investment trustee: Mr. Gray – 14,359,231 units, and (c) the following units held by a separate legal entity and for which the named executive officer maintains voting and investment control: Mr. Schwarzman – 1,438,529 units, Mr. Finley – 72,000 units, Mr. Baratta – 4,248,950 units, \n \n256 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nand Mr. Sawhney – 56,000 units.

As of January 1, 2025, pursuant to this formula, 174,967,230 shares of common stock, which is equal to 0.15 times the number of shares of our common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units outstanding on December 31, 2024, were available for issuance under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan. We have filed a registration statement and intend to file additional registration statements on Form \nS-8\n under the Securities Act to register shares of common stock covered by the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (including pursuant to automatic annual increases). Any such Form \nS-8\n registration statement will automatically become effective upon filing. Accordingly, shares of common stock registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market. \n \n257 \nTable of Contents\n \nItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence \nTax Receivable Agreements \nWe used a portion of the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of \nnon-voting\n common units to Beijing Wonderful Investments to purchase interests in the predecessor businesses from the predecessor owners. In addition, holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units (other than Blackstone Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries), subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions set forth in the partnership agreements of the Blackstone Holdings partnerships, may up to four times each year (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) exchange their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units for shares of our common stock on a \none-for-one\n basis. A Blackstone Holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the Blackstone Holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a share of common stock. Blackstone Holdings I L.P. and Blackstone Holdings II L.P. have made an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code effective for each taxable year in which an exchange of partnership units for a share of common stock occurs, which may result in an adjustment to the tax basis of the assets of such Blackstone Holdings Partnerships at the time of an exchange of partnership units. Other Blackstone Holdings Partnerships and certain subsidiary partnerships are expected to make such elections for the 2024 and subsequent taxable years with the filing of their federal income tax returns for such tax years. The purchase and subsequent exchanges of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Blackstone Holdings that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization and therefore reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units that provides for the payment by us to such holders of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by the corporate taxpayers or a change in control, as discussed below) as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. This payment obligation is an obligation of us (and certain of our subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes which we refer to as “the corporate taxpayers”) and not of Blackstone Holdings. The corporate taxpayers expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of the corporate taxpayers to the amount of such taxes that the corporate taxpayer would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Blackstone Holdings as a result of the exchanges and had the corporate taxpayers not entered into the tax receivable agreement. The term of the tax receivable agreement commenced upon consummation of our IPO and will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless the corporate taxpayers exercise their right to terminate the tax receivable agreement for an amount based on the agreed payments remaining to be made under the agreement. \nAssuming no future material changes in the relevant tax law and that the corporate taxpayers earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization of the assets, the expected future payments under the tax receivable agreement (which are taxable to the recipients) in respect of the purchase and exchanges will aggregate $1.8 billion over the next 15 years. The \nafter-tax\n net present value of these estimated payments totals $529.9 million assuming a 15% discount rate and using an estimate of timing of the benefit to be received. Future payments under the tax receivable agreement in respect of subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of Blackstone equity interests by the holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units mentioned above. \nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, payments totaling $46.3 million were made to certain holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units mentioned above in accordance with the tax receivable agreement and related to tax benefits the Partnership received for the 2023 taxable year. Such payments included $1.5 million to Mr. Schwarzman, $0.2 million to Mr. Chae, $0.08 million to Mr. Finley, $0.04 million to Mr. Sawhney, and $0.6 million to Mr. Baratta, which amounts include payments to vehicles controlled by such persons or their relatives, as applicable. \n \n258 \nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, the corporate taxpayers’ (or their successors’) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction) would be based on certain assumptions, including that the corporate taxpayers would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the benefits arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other similar benefits. Upon a subsequent actual exchange, any additional increase in tax deductions, tax basis and other similar benefits in excess of the amounts assumed at the change in control will also result in payments under the tax receivable agreement. \nDecisions we make in the course of running our business, such as with respect to mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes in control, may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by an exchanging or selling holder of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units under the tax receivable agreement. For example, the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction will generally accelerate payments under a tax receivable agreement and increase the present value of such payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase the tax liability of a holder of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units without giving rise to any rights of a holder of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to receive payments under any tax receivable agreements. \nAlthough we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge a tax basis increase, the corporate taxpayers will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under a tax receivable agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under a tax receivable agreement in excess of the corporate taxpayers’ cash tax savings. \nRegistration Rights Agreement \nIn connection with the restructuring and IPO, we entered into a registration rights agreement with our \npre-IPO\n owners, which was subsequently amended in connection with Blackstone’s conversion from a limited partnership to a corporation, pursuant to which we granted them, their affiliates and certain of their transferees the right, under certain circumstances and subject to certain restrictions, to require us to register under the Securities Act shares of common stock delivered in exchange for Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units or shares of common stock (and other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our shares of common stock) otherwise held by them. In addition, newly-admitted Blackstone senior managing directors and certain others who acquire Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units have subsequently become parties to the registration rights agreement. In addition, our founder, Stephen A. Schwarzman, has the right to request that we register the sale of shares of common stock held by holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units an unlimited number of times and may require us to make available shelf registration statements permitting sales of shares of common stock into the market from time to time over an extended period. In addition, Mr. Schwarzman has the ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights in respect of shares of common stock held by holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units in connection with registered offerings requested by other registration rights holders or initiated by us. \nTsinghua University Education Foundation \nAs part of an initiative announced in 2013, Mr. Schwarzman, through the Stephen A. Schwarzman Education Foundation, personally committed $100 million to create and endow a post-graduate scholarship program at Tsinghua University in Beijing, entitled “Schwarzman Scholars,” and fund the construction of a residential and academic building. He has led a fundraising campaign to raise $600 million to support the “Schwarzman Endowment Fund.” The Tsinghua University Education Foundation (“TUEF”) will hold the Schwarzman Endowment Fund and has agreed to delegate management of the fund to Blackstone. We have agreed that TUEF, and certain entities affiliated with TUEF, will not be required to pay Blackstone a management fee for managing the Schwarzman Endowment Fund and, to the extent Blackstone allocates and invests assets of the Schwarzman Endowment Fund in our funds, which may take the form of funded or unfunded general partner commitments to our investment funds, we anticipate that such investments will be subject to reduced or waived management fees and/or carried interest. \nJoseph P. Baratta \nMr. Baratta received a base salary of $350,000 and a bonus payment of $6,890,895. The bonus payment was based upon the performance of our private equity business, including the contribution of all current and past \n \n259 \nTable of Contents\n \nfunds within the business dating back to before the IPO. The ultimate bonus payment to Mr. Baratta was, however, determined in the discretion of Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Gray. On January 10, 2025, Mr. Baratta was granted 41,801 shares of deferred restricted common stock with a grant date fair value of $6,890,895, reflecting 100% of his annual bonus payment mandatorily deferred into deferred restricted common stock pursuant to the Bonus Deferral Plan. In April 2024, Mr. Baratta was awarded a discretionary award of 55,411 deferred restricted common stock units with a grant date fair value of $7,260,503. This award reflected 2023 performance and was intended to further promote retention and to incentivize future performance. See “—Item 11. Executive Compensation — Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 — Terms of Discretionary Equity Awards” for discussion of the vesting terms applicable to Mr. Baratta’s equity awards. \nMr. Baratta also participated in the performance fees of our funds, consisting of carried interest in our carry funds and incentive fees in our funds that pay incentive fees. The compensation paid to Mr. Baratta in respect of carried interest in our carry funds primarily relates to Mr. Baratta’s participation in the private equity funds (which were formed both before and after the IPO). The amount of distributions, whether cash or \nin-kind,\n in respect of carried interest or incentive fee allocations to Mr. Baratta for 2024 was $26,095,196. Any \nin-kind\n distributions in respect of carried interest are reported based on the market value of the securities distributed as of the date of distribution. See “—Item 11. Executive Compensation — Compensation Elements for Named Executive Officers” in this report for additional discussion of the elements of our compensation program. \nBlackstone Holdings Partnership Agreements \nAs a result of the reorganization and the IPO, Blackstone Inc. (at that time, The Blackstone Group L.P.) became a holding partnership and, through wholly owned subsidiaries, held equity interests in the five holdings partnerships (i.e., Blackstone Holdings I L.P., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings III L.P., Blackstone Holdings IV L.P. and Blackstone Holdings V L.P.). On January 1, 2009, in order to simplify our structure and ease the related administrative burden and costs, we effected an internal restructuring to reduce the number of holding partnerships from five to four by causing Blackstone Holdings III L.P. to transfer all of its assets and liabilities to Blackstone Holdings IV L.P. In connection therewith, Blackstone Holdings IV L.P. was renamed Blackstone Holdings III L.P. and Blackstone Holdings V L.P. was renamed Blackstone Holdings IV L.P. On October 1, 2015, Blackstone formed a new holding partnership, Blackstone Holdings AI L.P., which holds certain operating entities and operates in a manner similar to the other Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. “Blackstone Holdings” refers to (a) Blackstone Holdings I L.P., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings III L.P., Blackstone Holdings IV L.P. and Blackstone Holdings V L.P. prior to the January 2009 reorganization, (b) Blackstone Holdings I L.P., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings III L.P. and Blackstone Holdings IV L.P. from January 1, 2009 through October 1, 2015 and (c) Blackstone Holdings I L.P., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings III L.P., Blackstone Holdings IV L.P. and Blackstone Holdings AI L.P. subsequent to the October 2015 creation of Blackstone Holdings AI L.P. \nWholly owned subsidiaries of Blackstone Inc. which are the general partners of those partnerships have the right to determine when distributions will be made to the partners of Blackstone Holdings and the amount of any such distributions. If a distribution is authorized, such distribution will be made to the partners of Blackstone Holdings \npro-rata\n in accordance with the percentages of their respective partnership interests as described under “Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Dividend Policy.” \nEach of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships has an identical number of partnership units outstanding, and we use the terms “Blackstone Holdings Partnership Unit” or “partnership unit in/of Blackstone Holdings” to refer, collectively, to a partnership unit in each of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. The holders of partnership units in Blackstone Holdings, including Blackstone Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries, will incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their proportionate share of any net taxable income of Blackstone profits and net losses of Blackstone Holdings will generally be allocated to its partners (including Blackstone Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries) \npro-rata\n in accordance with the percentages of their respective partnership interests as described under “Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Dividend Policy.” The partnership agreements of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships provide for cash distributions, which we refer to as “tax distributions,” to the partners of such partnerships if the wholly owned subsidiaries of Blackstone Inc. which are the general partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships determine that the taxable income of the relevant partnership will give rise to taxable income for its partners. \n \n260 \nTable of Contents\nGenerally, these tax distributions are computed based on our estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in New York, New York (taking into account the \nnon-deductibility\n of certain expenses and the character of our income). Tax distributions are made only to the extent all distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year are insufficient to cover such tax liabilities. \nSubject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions set forth in the partnership agreements of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships, Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units may be exchanged for shares of common stock as described under “- Exchange Agreement” below. In addition, the Blackstone Holdings partnership agreements authorize the wholly owned subsidiaries of Blackstone Inc., which are the general partners of those partnerships, to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units, and which may be exchangeable for shares of our common stock. \nSee “—Item 11. Executive Compensation — Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 — Terms of Discretionary Equity Awards” for a discussion of minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions applicable to the Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. The generally applicable minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions are outlined in the sections referenced in the preceding sentence. There may be some different arrangements for some individuals in some instances. In addition, we may waive these requirements and restrictions from time to time. \nIn addition, substantially all of our expenses, including substantially all expenses solely incurred by or attributable to Blackstone Inc. but not including obligations incurred under the tax receivable agreement by Blackstone Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries, income tax expenses of Blackstone Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries and payments on indebtedness incurred by Blackstone Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries, are borne by Blackstone Holdings. \nExchange Agreement \nIn connection with the reorganization and IPO, we entered into an exchange agreement with the holders of partnership units in Blackstone Holdings (other than Blackstone Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries). In addition, certain Blackstone senior managing directors and others who have acquired Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units also have become parties to the exchange agreement. Under the exchange agreement, as amended, subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions set forth in the partnership agreements of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships, each such holder of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units (and certain transferees thereof) may up to four times each year (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) exchange these partnership units for shares of our common stock on a \none-for-one\n basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. Under the exchange agreement, to effect an exchange a holder of partnership units in Blackstone Holdings must simultaneously exchange one partnership unit in each of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. As a holder exchanges its Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units, Blackstone Inc.’s indirect interest in the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships will be correspondingly increased. \nPayments to Kirkland & Ellis LLP \nReginald J. Brown, a member of our board of directors, is a partner at the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”). We have engaged Kirkland from time to time in the ordinary course of business to provide legal services to us and our subsidiaries. Our relationship with Kirkland \npre-dates\n Mr. Brown’s appointment to our board of directors. During 2024, we paid Kirkland approximately $101.3 million in legal fees (the “Fees”), and Mr. Brown’s interest in the Fees is estimated to be less than 1% of the Fees. Mr. Brown does not receive any direct compensation, specific origination bonus or other disproportionate allocation from legal fees we pay to Kirkland. \nFirm Use of Private Aircraft \nCertain entities controlled by Mr. Schwarzman wholly own aircraft that we use for business purposes in the course of our operations, and in 2024, we made payments of $4.0 million for the use of such aircraft, which included \n \n261 \nTable of Contents\n \n$2.6 million paid directly to the managers of the aircraft. An entity controlled by Mr. Gray wholly owns aircraft that we use for business purposes in the course of our operations, and in 2024, we made payments of $4.8 million for the use of such aircraft, which included $2.3 million paid directly to the manager of the aircraft. An entity jointly controlled by Mr. Baratta and two other individuals owns aircraft that we use for business purposes in the course of our operations, and in 2024, we made payments of $1.5 million for the use of such aircraft, which included $0.9 million paid directly to the manager of the aircraft. As part of these arrangements, when we use such aircraft for business purposes from time to time, Messrs. Schwarzman, Gray and Baratta or their affiliated entities, as applicable, receive from their respective manager all or substantially all of the charter charges, net of any fee retained by such manager. Each of Messrs. Schwarzman, Gray, and Baratta paid for his respective ownership interest in his aircraft himself and bore his respective share of all operating, personnel and maintenance costs associated with the operation of such aircraft. The hourly payments we made for use of such aircraft were based on current market rates. \nInvestment In or Alongside Our Funds \nOur directors and executive officers may invest their own capital in or alongside our funds and other vehicles we manage, in some instances, without being subject to management fees, carried interest or incentive fees. For our carry funds, these investments may be made through the applicable fund general partner and fund a portion of the general partner capital commitments to our funds. These investment opportunities are available to all of our senior managing directors and to those of our employees whom we have determined to have a status that reasonably permits us to offer them these types of investments and in compliance with applicable laws. During the year ended December 31, 2024, our directors and executive officers (and, in some cases, certain investment trusts or other family vehicles or charitable organizations controlled by them or their immediate family members) had the following gross contributions relating to their personal investments (and the investments of any such trusts) in Blackstone funds and other Blackstone-managed vehicles: Mr. Schwarzman, Mr. Gray, Mr. Baratta, Mr. Breyer, Mr. Chae, Ms. Porat, Mr. Sawhney, Mr. Finley, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Parrett made gross contributions of $281.6 million, $39.9 million, $6.1 million, $4.3 million, $2.8 million, $1.3 million, $1.1 million, $0.6 million, $0.3 million, and $0.2 million, respectively. \nStatement of Policy Regarding Transactions with Related Persons \nOur board of directors has adopted a written statement of policy regarding transactions with related persons, which we refer to as our “related person policy.” Our related person policy requires that a “related person” (as defined as in paragraph (a) of Item 404 of Regulation \nS-K)\n must promptly disclose to the Chief Legal Officer any “related person transaction” (defined as any transaction that is reportable by us under Item 404(a) of Regulation \nS-K\n in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest) and all material facts with respect thereto. The Chief Legal Officer will then promptly communicate that information to the board of directors. No related person transaction will be consummated without the approval or ratification of the board of directors or any committee of the board of directors consisting exclusively of independent and disinterested directors. It is our policy that directors interested in a related person transaction will recuse themselves from any vote of a related person transaction in which they have an interest. \nNon-Competition\n and \nNon-Solicitation\n Agreements \nWe have entered into a \nnon-competition\n and \nnon-solicitation\n agreement with each of our Senior Managing Directors, including each of our executive officers. See “—Item 11. Executive Compensation \n— Non-Competition\n and \nNon-Solicitation\n Agreements” for a description of the material terms of such agreements. \nDirector Independence \nSee “—Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Controlled Company Exception and Director Independence” for information on director independence. \n \n262 \nTable of Contents\nItem 14.
