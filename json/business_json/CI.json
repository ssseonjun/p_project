MD&A.\nCommentary: 2024 versus 2023\nThe commentary presented below, and the segment commentaries that follow, compare results for the year ended December 31, 2024 with results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Commentary regarding percentage changes (or bps) and dollar variances represents the driver's impact on the overall category.\nShareholders' net income \ndecreased 34%, or $1,730 million, primarily reflecting increased net investment losses (-$2,415 million) driven by the impairment of VillageMD equity securities, as well as the absence of the foreign deferred tax benefits recorded in 2023 (-$1,155 million). These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower net losses on sale of businesses (+$1,431 million) and higher adjusted income from operations (+$293 million). See further discussion of these drivers below.\nAdjusted income from operations\n increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher earnings in Evernorth Health Services, partially offset by lower earnings in Cigna Healthcare.\nMedical customers\n decreased 3%, primarily reflecting a decrease in Individual and Family Plans (\"IFP\") customers.\nPharmacy revenues \nincreased 35%, primarily reflecting higher utilization of prescription drugs from customer growth in Evernorth Health Services.\nPremiums\n increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher premium rates in our U.S. Healthcare operating segment.\n41\nFees and other revenues \nincreased 17%, primarily reflecting growth in affordability services within our Pharmacy Benefit Services operating segment.\nNet investment income\n decreased 17%, primarily due to a $182 million impairment of dividend receivable in the third quarter of 2024 related to VillageMD accrued dividends.\nPharmacy and other service costs \nincreased 36%, primarily reflecting higher utilization of prescription drugs from customer growth in Evernorth Health Services.\nMedical costs and other benefit expenses \nincreased 7%, primarily reflecting higher medical costs in our U.S. Healthcare operating segment.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses\n were flat, primarily reflecting increases in strategic investments to support both business growth and continued advancement of our digital capabilities and solutions (3%), offset by the absence of costs reported in 2023 for an organizational efficiency plan (-2%) and litigation settlements (-1%).\nNet gain (loss) on sale of businesses. \nThe gain reported in 2024 reflects the sale of a portion of an equity method investment, partially offset by an estimated loss on sale (primarily goodwill impairment) related to the HCSC transaction (defined below). The loss reported in 2023 primarily reflects a goodwill impairment related to the HCSC transaction. See Note 5 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the HCSC transaction and the equity method investment sale, respectively.\nInvestment results\n primarily reflect the impairment of VillageMD equity securities in 2024. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment of VillageMD equity securities.\nThe effective tax rate\n increased, primarily driven by the absence of foreign deferred tax benefits recorded in 2023 and a valuation allowance related to the impairment of VillageMD equity securities, partially offset by the absence of the impact of the valuation allowance resulting from the HCSC transaction recorded in 2023. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these matters. \nKey Transactions and Business Developments\nSale of Medicare Advantage and Related Businesses\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Individual Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Plans, Medicare and Other Supplemental Benefits, and CareAllies businesses within the U.S. Healthcare operating segment to Health Care Service Corporation (\"HCSC\") (\"HCSC transaction\"). The initial $3.3 billion purchase price is anticipated to increase at closing, reflecting higher statutory surplus for the legal entities that will convey to HCSC. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nWe maintain liquidity at two levels: the subsidiary level and the parent company level.\nSubsidiary Level. \nCash requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of pharmacy, medical costs and other benefit payments; expense requirements, primarily for employee compensation and benefits, information technology and facilities costs; income taxes; and debt service. \nOur subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments; using cash flows from operating activities; matching durations of investments to estimated durations for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities; selling investments; and borrowing from affiliates, subject to applicable regulatory limits.\nParent Level. \nCash requirements at the parent company level generally consist of debt service; payment of declared dividends to shareholders; lending to subsidiaries as needed; and pension plan funding.\nThe parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments; collecting dividends from its subsidiaries; using proceeds from issuing debt and common stock; and borrowing from its subsidiaries, subject to applicable regulatory limits.\n42\nRegulatory Restrictions. \nDividends from our insurance, Health Maintenance Organization (\"HMO\") and certain foreign subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these restrictions. Most of the Evernorth Health Services segment operations are not subject to regulatory restrictions regarding dividends and therefore provide significant financial flexibility to The Cigna Group.\nInvestment Portfolio. \nWe support the liquidity needs of our businesses by managing the duration of invested assets to be consistent with the duration of liabilities. We manage the portfolio to both optimize returns in the current economic environment and meet our liquidity needs.\nCash flows for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating activities\n$\n10,363\n \n$\n11,813 \n$\n8,656 \nInvesting activities\n$\n(2,102)\n$\n(5,174)\n$\n3,098 \nFinancing activities\n$\n(7,647)\n$\n(4,294)\n$\n(11,240)\nThe following discussion explains variances in the various categories of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. \nOperating Activities. \nCash flows from operating activities consist principally of cash receipts and disbursements for pharmacy revenues and costs, premiums, fees, investment income, taxes, benefit costs and other expenses.\nOperating cash flows decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to higher insurance claims and related payments as well as higher accounts receivable as a result of organic business growth and timing. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable net cash flow impacts of new clients in Evernorth Health Services, higher pharmacy and service costs payable, and lower income tax payments.\nInvesting Activities. \nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to lower purchases of equity securities.\nFinancing Activities. \nThe Company had higher share repurchases, including the completed ASR Agreements (described below), partially offset by net cash provided by debt financing activities in 2024.\nCapital Resources\nOur capital resources consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and investments maintained at regulated subsidiaries required to underwrite insurance risks, cash flows from operating activities, our commercial paper program, credit agreements and the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities. Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operations, some of which is subject to regulatory restrictions relative to the amount and timing of dividend payments to the parent company. Dividends received from U.S.- regulated subsidiaries were $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Non-regulated subsidiaries also generate significant cash flows from operating activities, which is typically available immediately to the parent company for general corporate purposes. \nWe prioritize our use of capital resources to (i) invest in capital expenditures (primarily related to technology to support innovative solutions for our clients and customers), provide the capital necessary to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries, and to repay debt and fund pension obligations if necessary; (ii) pay dividends to shareholders; (iii) consider acquisitions and investments that are strategically and economically advantageous; and (iv) return capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\nFunds Available\nCommercial Paper Program\n.\n The commercial paper program had approximately $0.9 billion outstanding at December 31, 2024. \nRevolving Credit Agreements. \nOur revolving credit agreements provide us with the ability to borrow amounts for general corporate purposes, including for the purpose of providing liquidity support if necessary under our commercial paper program discussed above. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our credit agreements and commercial paper program. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $6.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our revolving credit agreements (these amounts are available for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity support for our commercial paper program), $5.6 billion of \n43\nremaining capacity under our commercial paper program and $7.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately $0.8 billion of which was held by the parent company or certain nonregulated subsidiaries.\nOur debt-to-capitalization ratio (calculated as Short-term debt and Long-term debt (\"Total debt\") as a percentage of Total shareholders' equity and Total debt (\"Total capitalization\")) was 43.8% and 40.1% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy.\nSubsidiary Borrowings. \nIn addition to the sources of liquidity discussed above, the parent company can borrow an additional $1.8 billion from its subsidiaries without further approvals as of December 31, 2024.\nUse of Capital Resources\nCapital Expenditures\n.\n Capital expenditures for property, equipment and computer software were $1.4 billion in 2024 compared to $1.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, which will be funded primarily from operating cash flows.\nDividends\n.\n The Company currently intends to pay regular quarterly dividends, with future declarations subject to approval by its Board of Directors and the Board's determination that the declaration of dividends remains in the best interests of The Cigna Group and its shareholders. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the dividend payments declared and paid during 2024, as well as the first quarter 2025 declared cash dividend. \nShare Repurchases\n.\n The Company maintains a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors, under which it may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternate uses of capital. The share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. \nIncluding the Accelerated Share Repurchase agreements (discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) (the \"ASR Agreements\"), we repurchased 20.9 million shares for approximately $7.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 7.8 million shares for approximately $2.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. In December 2024, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $6.0 billion in incremental share repurchase authorization, bringing the company's total share repurchase authority to $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. From January 1, 2025 through February 26, 2025, we repurchased 3.0 million shares for approximately $901 million. Share repurchase authority was $9.4 billion as of February 26, 2025.\nOther Sources of Funds and Uses of Capital Resources\nDivestiture. \nAs discussed in the \"Key Transactions and Business Developments\" section above, the HCSC transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. We anticipate use of the proceeds in alignment with our capital deployment priorities, with the majority allocated to share repurchases.\nRisks to Liquidity and Capital Resources\nRisks to our liquidity and capital resources outlook include cash projections that may not be realized, and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if our ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Form 10-K. \nGuarantees and Contractual Obligations\n \nWe are contingently liable for various contractual obligations and financial and other guarantees entered into in the ordinary course of business. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of various guarantees. \nOn Balance Sheet\n:\nLong-Term Debt. \nTotal scheduled payments on long-term debt are $48.5 billion (of which $3.5 billion relate to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025), which include scheduled interest payments and maturities of long-term debt. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding principal maturities of long-term debt.\n44\nOther Non-Current Liabilities. \nThese include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, including obligations associated with other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations, reinsurance liabilities, supplemental and deferred compensation plans, and interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts. \nUncertain Tax Positions. \nIn the event we are unable to sustain all of our $1.5 billion of uncertain tax positions, it could result in future tax payments of approximately $1.0 billion. We are adequately reserved for such positions. As a result, there is minimal direct risk to earnings should we fail to sustain our positions. We cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such future payments. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on uncertain tax positions.\nOff-Balance Sheet\n: \nPurchase Obligations. \nThese include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. Purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancellable without penalty and those that do not contractually require minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased. As of December 31, 2024, purchase obligations consisted of a total of $4.2 billion of estimated payments required under contractual arrangements (of which we expect $1.6 billion of purchase obligations to be paid within the next 12 months beginning January 1, 2025). This includes the following:\n•\n$2.7 billion of investment commitments (of which we expect $0.9 billion of the committed amounts to be disbursed in 2025). See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on investment commitments.\n•\n$1.5 billion of future service commitments (of which we expect $0.7 billion of the committed amounts to be disbursed in 2025), primarily comprised of contracts for certain outsourced business processes and information technology maintenance and support.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n•\nit requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and\n•\nchanges in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nManagement has discussed how critical accounting estimates are developed and selected with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures presented in this Form 10-K. We regularly evaluate items that may impact critical accounting estimates.\nIn addition to the estimates described below, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describe other estimates that management has made in preparation of the financial statements. Management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience significantly differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition. The information below presents the adverse impacts of certain possible changes in assumptions. The effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, except for assessing impairment of goodwill.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nNature of Critical Accounting Estimate. \nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of their net assets at the acquisition date. Intangible assets primarily reflect the value of customer relationships and other intangibles acquired in business combinations.\nFair values of reporting units are estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis and market approach models using assumptions that we believe a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price. The significant assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value primarily include the discount rate and future cash flows. A discount rate is selected to correspond with each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, consistent with that used for investment decisions considering the specific and detailed operating plans and strategies within each reporting unit. Projections of future cash flows differ by reporting unit and are consistent with our ongoing strategic projections. Future cash flows for the Evernorth Health Services reporting units are primarily driven by the forecasted gross margins of the business, as well as operating expenses and long-term growth rates. Future cash flows for our other reporting units are primarily driven by forecasted revenues, benefit expenses, operating expenses and long-\n45\nterm growth rates.\nThe fair value of intangibles and the amortization method were determined using an income approach that relies on projected future cash flows, including key assumptions for customer attrition and discount rates. Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value.\nThe Company conducts its quantitative evaluation for goodwill impairment at least annually during the third quarter at the reporting unit level and performs qualitative impairment assessments on a quarterly basis to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. \nExcluding amounts classified as held for sale, Goodwill and other intangibles as of December 31, 2024 were $44,370 million and\n \n$29,417 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2023, were $44,259 million and $30,863 million, respectively. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\n \nEffect if Different Assumptions Used. \nWe completed our normal annual evaluations for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the third quarter of 2024. The evaluations support that as of December 31, 2024, the fair value estimates of our reporting units exceed their carrying values by substantial margins. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, including macroeconomic factors, government legislation, changes in the competitive landscape or other market conditions, could impact our ability to achieve profitability projections. If we consistently do not achieve our earnings and cash flow projections or our cost of capital rises significantly, the assumptions and estimates underlying the goodwill and intangible asset impairment evaluations could be adversely affected and result in future impairment charges that would negatively impact our operating results and financial position. \nIncome Taxes - Uncertain Tax Positions\nNature of Critical Accounting Estimate. \nWe evaluate tax positions to determine whether the benefits are more likely than not to be sustained on audit based on their technical merits. The Company establishes a liability if the probability that the position will be sustained is 50% or less. For uncertain positions that management believes are more likely than not to be sustained, the Company recognizes a liability based upon management's estimate of the most likely settlement outcome with the taxing authority. These amounts primarily relate to federal and state uncertain positions of the value and timing of deductions and uncertain positions of attributing taxable income to states.\nBalances that are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accrued expenses and other liabilities were $1,477 million and $1,399 million as of December 31, 2024 and\n \nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion around uncertain tax positions and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for a discussion of their potential impact on liquidity. \nEffect if Different Assumptions Used. \nThe factors that could impact our estimates of uncertain tax positions include the likelihood of sustaining our tax position (and related assumed interest and penalties) under audit. If our positions are upheld upon audit, our net income would increase.\nIncome Taxes - Valuation Allowance\nNature of Critical Accounting Estimate. \nDeferred income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of the Company's underlying assets and liabilities, and are established based upon enacted tax rates and laws. Deferred income tax assets are recognized when available evidence indicates that realization is more likely than not and a valuation allowance is established to the extent this standard is not met. It is possible that the realization of deferred tax assets may be impacted by changes in forecasted future earnings in various foreign jurisdictions or the Company's ability to generate future capital gains.\nValuation allowances that are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Deferred tax liabilities, net were $2,332 million and $1,498 million as of December 31, 2024 and\n \nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion around valuation allowances.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used. \nThe factors that could impact our estimates of valuation allowances include changes in forecasted future earnings in foreign jurisdictions, potential international tax reform as a result of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development initiatives, and the Company's future ability to generate capital gains. Decreases in our valuation allowance would increase net income, while increases in our valuation allowance would decrease net income.\n46\nUnpaid Claims and Claims Expenses - Cigna Healthcare\nNature of Critical Accounting Estimate. \nUnpaid claims and claim expenses reflect estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported, expected development on reported claims, claims that have been reported but not yet paid (reported claims in process) and other medical care expenses and services payable that are primarily comprised of accruals for incentives and other amounts payable to health care professionals and facilities. \nUnpaid claims and claim expenses in Cigna Healthcare are primarily impacted by assumptions related to completion factors and medical cost trend. Variation of actual results from either assumption could impact the unpaid claims balance as noted below. A large number of factors may cause the medical cost trend to vary from the Company's estimates, including changes in health management practices, changes in the level and mix of benefits offered and services utilized, and changes in medical practices. Completion factors may be affected if actual claims submission rates from providers differ from estimates (that can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), or if changes to the Company's internal claims processing patterns occur. \nUnpaid claims and claim expenses for the Cigna Healthcare segment, both gross and net of reinsurance and other recoverables, as of December 31, 2024 were $5,018 million gross and $4,859 million net and as of December 31, 2023 were $5,092 million gross and $4,856 million net. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding assumptions and methods used to estimate this liability.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used. \nBased on studies of our claim experience, it is reasonably possible that a 100 basis point change in the medical cost trend and a 50 basis point change in completion factors could occur in the near term. A 100 basis point increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase this liability by approximately $110 million, resulting in a decrease in net income of approximately $85 million after-tax, and a 50 basis point decrease in completion factors would increase this liability by approximately $185 million, resulting in a decrease in net income of approximately $145 million after-tax.\nValuation of Debt Security Investments\nNature of Critical Accounting Estimate. \nMost debt securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss within Shareholders' equity. Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date.\nDetermining fair value for a financial instrument requires management judgment. The degree of judgment involved generally correlates to the level of pricing readily observable in the markets. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets or with market-observable inputs to determine fair value, such as public securities, generally require less judgment. Conversely, private placements including more complex securities that are traded infrequently are typically measured using pricing models that require more judgment as to the inputs and assumptions used to estimate fair value. There may be a number of alternative inputs to select based on an understanding of the issuer, the structure of the security and overall market conditions. In addition, these factors are inherently variable in nature as they change frequently in response to market conditions. Approximately 60% of our debt securities are public securities and approximately 40% are private placement securities.\nTypically, the most significant input in the measurement of fair value is the market interest rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows of the instrument. Such market rates are derived by calculating the appropriate spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury securities, based on the credit quality, industry and structure of the asset.\nBalances that are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Investments and Long-term investments, inclusive of amounts held for sale, were $9,423\n \nmillion and $9,855 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Notes 11A and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our fair value measurements, the procedures performed by management to determine that the amounts represent appropriate estimates and our accounting policy regarding unrealized appreciation on debt securities.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used. \nIf the derived market rates used to calculate fair value increased by 100 basis points, the fair value of the total debt security portfolio of $9.4 billion would decrease by approximately $0.5 billion, resulting in an after-tax decrease to shareholders' equity of approximately $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n47\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nThe following section of this MD&A discusses the results of each of our segments. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of our segments.\nIn segment discussions, we present \"adjusted revenues\" and \"pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations,\" defined as income (loss) before income taxes excluding pre-tax income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net investment gains/losses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and special items. The Company uses \"pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations\" and \"adjusted revenues\" as its principal financial measures of segment operating performance because management believes these metrics reflect the underlying results of business operations and facilitate analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and profitability. The Cigna Group share of certain investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. Special items are matters that management, including the chief operating decision maker, believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. Ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as adjusted revenues and pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these metrics and a reconciliation of income (loss) before income taxes to pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations, as well as a reconciliation of Total revenues to adjusted revenues. Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements also explains that segment revenues include both external revenues and sales between segments that are eliminated in Corporate. \nIn these segment discussions, we also present \"pre-tax margin,\" calculated as pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations divided by adjusted revenues.\nSee the \"Executive Overview\" section of this MD&A for summarized financial results of each of our segments.\nEvernorth Health Services Segment\nEvernorth Health Services includes a broad range of coordinated and point solution health services and capabilities, as well as those from partners across the health care system, within our Pharmacy Benefit Services and Specialty and Care Services operating segments. As described in the introduction to Segment Reporting, Evernorth Health Services' performance is measured using adjusted revenues and pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations.\nKey Factors Affecting Segment Performance\nThe key factors that impact the performance of Evernorth Health Services Pharmacy Benefit Services and Specialty and Care Services revenues and income from operations are volume, mix of claims, price and contract affordability services. Specialty and Care Services revenues are also impacted by specialty distribution customer growth and client growth. These key factors are discussed further below. Certain of the key factors impact both operating segments as services are offered through an integrated client contract. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information on revenue and cost recognition policies for this segment.\nKey factors that impact both Pharmacy Benefit Services and Specialty and Care Services:\n•\nPharmacy claim volume (also referred to as utilization) relates to processing prescription claims filled by retail pharmacies in our network and dispensing prescription claims from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies, along with other claims. Pharmacy claim volume (utilization) is impacted by new clients or organic customer growth through the expansion of existing clients.\n•\nThe mix of claims generally considers the type of drug and distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling. In addition to the types of drugs, the mix of generic or biosimilar claims also impacts our results. Generally, a higher mix of generic and biosimilar drugs reduces revenues and increases income from operations, as generic and biosimilar drugs are typically priced lower than the branded drugs they replace, providing positive impacts or our clients, our customers and us. \n•\nPharmaceutical manufacturer inflation also impacts our pricing because most of our contracts provide that we bill clients and pay pharmacies based on a generally recognized price index for pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the rate of inflation for prescription drugs and our efforts to manage this inflation for our clients continue to be significant drivers of our revenues and cost of revenues in the current environment.\n•\nOur client contract pricing is impacted by our ongoing ability to negotiate favorable contracts for pharmacy network, pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing and manufacturer rebates on our clients' behalf (also referred to as affordability improvements). Through these affordability services, we seek to improve the effectiveness of our integrated and fee-for-service solutions, for the benefit of our new and existing clients, by continuously innovating, improving affordability and implementing drug purchasing contract initiatives. Our continued affordability improvements further reduce drug costs for the benefit of our consumers and clients, and we share in the value delivered, which generally results in a favorable impact on our income from operations.\n48\nKey factors that impact Specialty and Care Services:\n•\nCustomer growth generally results in increased revenues and income from operations. This generally includes both organic customer growth through the expansion of existing business and new business, as well as higher volume in our specialty distribution services where we deliver pharmaceuticals and medical supplies directly to health care providers, clinics and hospitals, primarily to physicians who regularly order costly specialty pharmaceuticals. This business provides competitive pricing on pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and leverages our distribution platform to improve our results.\n•\nClient growth, both organic and new business, in our Care Services business generally results in increased revenues and income from operations. This includes client movement in our virtual care, in-home care, physical primary care, benefits management and behavioral health services as we expand our businesses and build upon our cross-enterprise leverage.\nResults of Operations\nFinancial Summary\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nChange\nChange\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nAdjusted revenues \n(1)\n$\n202,155\n \n$\n153,499 \n$\n140,335 \n$\n48,656 \n32 \n%\n$\n13,164 \n9 \n%\nPre-tax adjusted income from operations \n(1)\n$\n7,001\n \n$\n6,442 \n$\n6,127 \n$\n559 \n9 \n%\n$\n315 \n5 \n%\nPre-tax margin \n(1)(2)\n3.5\n \n%\n4.2 \n%\n4.4 \n%\n(70)\nbps\n(20)\n \nbps\nSG&A expense ratio \n(3)\n1.9\n \n%\n2.2 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n(30)\nbps\n20 \n \nbps\n(1)\nSee Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliation of adjusted revenues and pre-tax adjusted income from operations to Total revenues and Income before income taxes, respectively.\n(2)\nPre-tax margin is calculated as pre-tax adjusted income from operations divided by adjusted revenues. \n(3)\nSG&A expense ratio is calculated as segment selling, general and administrative expenses divided by adjusted revenues.

As described in the introduction to Segment Reporting, performance of the Cigna Healthcare segment is measured using adjusted revenues and pre-tax adjusted income from operations.\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Individual Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Plans, Medicare and Other Supplemental Benefits, and CareAllies businesses within the U.S. Healthcare operating segment. See \"Key Transactions and Business Developments\" for further discussion. \nKey Factors Affecting Segment Performance \nThe key factors that impact Cigna Healthcare revenues and income from operations include revenue growth, customer growth, medical cost trend, percentage of Medicare Advantage customers in plans eligible for quality bonus payments, the medical care ratio (\"MCR\") and the SG&A expense ratio. These key factors are discussed further below. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information on revenue and cost-recognition policies for this segment.\n•\nRevenue growth includes increases to premium rates in consideration of anticipated medical cost increases, customer growth driven by new clients and customers, and increased fee revenue from the expansion of products and services to existing clients and customers, including solutions provided by Evernorth Health Services.\n•\nHigher medical costs (also referred to as higher medical cost trend) is impacted by utilization (the quantity of medical services consumed by our customers), unit costs (the cost per medical service) and mix of services. \n•\nPrior to the divestiture of our Medicare Advantage and related businesses to HCSC, the percentage of Medicare Advantage customers in bonus-eligible plans impacts the amount of quality bonus payments we receive. \n•\nMCR represents medical costs as a percentage of premiums for our segment's insured businesses, and it is impacted by medical cost trend and premium rates. Affordability initiatives that serve to mitigate medical cost inflation also impact the MCR. \n•\nThe SG&A expense ratio represents the segment's selling, general and administrative expenses divided by adjusted revenues.\nResults of Operations\nFinancial Summary\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nChange\nChange\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nAdjusted revenues \n(1)\n$\n52,914\n \n$\n51,205 \n$\n45,037 \n$\n1,709 \n3 \n%\n$\n6,168 \n14 \n%\nPre-tax adjusted income from operations \n(1)\n$\n4,229\n \n$\n4,478 \n$\n4,099 \n$\n(249)\n(6)\n%\n$\n379 \n9 \n%\nPre-tax margin\n (1)(2)\n8.0\n \n%\n8.7 \n%\n9.1 \n%\n(70)\nbps\n(40)\nbps\nMedical care ratio\n83.2\n \n%\n81.3 \n%\n81.7 \n%\n190 \nbps\n(40)\nbps\nSG&A expense ratio \n(3)\n20.4\n \n%\n21.6 \n%\n21.8 \n%\n(120)\nbps\n(20)\nbps\n(1)\nSee Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliation of adjusted revenues and pre-tax adjusted income from operations to Total revenues and Income before income taxes, respectively. \n(2)\nPre-tax margin is calculated as pre-tax adjusted income from operations divided by adjusted revenues.\n(3)\nSG&A expense ratio is calculated as segment selling, general and administrative expenses divided by adjusted revenues.

The impact of higher premiums in adjusted revenues and medical costs are reflected in the medical care ratio calculation.\nThe \nmedical care ratio\n increased 190 bps for the year ended and 570 bps for the three months ended December 31, 2024. The increases for both periods were primarily due to higher stop loss medical costs.\nThe \nSG&A expense ratio\n decreased 120 bps, primarily due to revenue growth outpacing volume-related expenses (-60 bps), as well as ongoing efficiencies (-30 bps).\nMedical Customers\nA medical customer is defined as a person meeting any one of the following criteria:\n•\nis covered under a medical insurance policy, managed care arrangement or administrative services agreement issued by us;\n•\nhas access to our provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or\n•\nhas medical claims that are administered by us.\nCigna Healthcare Medical Customers\nAs of December 31,\nChange\nChange\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nU.S. Healthcare\n3,853\n \n4,280 \n3,587 \n(427)\n(10)\n693 \n19 \nInternational Health \n(1)\n1,211\n \n1,184 \n1,169 \n27 \n2 \n15 \n1 \nInsured\n5,064\n \n5,464 \n4,756 \n(400)\n(7)\n%\n708 \n15 \n%\nU.S. Healthcare\n13,649\n \n13,890 \n12,619 \n(241)\n(2)\n1,271 \n10 \nInternational Health \n(1)\n434\n \n426 \n629 \n8 \n2 \n(203)\n(32)\nAdministrative services only\n14,083\n \n14,316 \n13,248 \n(233)\n(2)\n1,068 \n8 \nTotal\n19,147\n \n19,780 \n18,004 \n(633)\n(3)\n%\n1,776 \n10 \n%\n(1)\nInternational Health excludes medical customers served by less than 100%-owned subsidiaries, as well as certain customers served by our third-party administrator.\nTotal medical customers decreased 3%, primarily due to a decline in IFP customers.

We believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms. We manage the portfolio for long-term economics and therefore we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term. Although future declines in investment fair values remain possible due to interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investment-specific uncertainties and global economic uncertainties as discussed below, we do not expect these losses to have a material unfavorable effect on our financial condition or liquidity. The below discussion addresses the strategies and risks associated with our various classes of investment assets. See",
    "item1a": "Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" for additional information regarding risks associated with our investment portfolio.\n52\nDebt Securities\nThe carrying value of our debt securities portfolio decreased from $9.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 to $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, primarily \nreflecting net sales activity\n. Our portfolio remains in a net unrealized depreciation position due to generally increasing interest rates over the past few years. \nAs of December 31, 2024, $8.1 billion, or 86%, of the debt securities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (Baa and above, or equivalent) and the remaining $1.3 billion were below investment grade. The majority of the bonds that are below investment grade were rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. These quality characteristics have not materially changed since the prior year and remain consistent with our investment strategy. \nInvestments in debt securities are diversified by issuer, geography and industry. On an aggregate basis, the debt securities portfolio continues to perform according to original expectations, which includes a long-term economic investment strategy. Primary risks facing many of the issuers in our portfolio include ongoing geopolitical events and economic conditions, including expectations for a longer period of higher inflation and interest rates. To date, most issuers have been successful in managing these issues without a meaningful change in credit quality. We continue to monitor the economic environment and its effect on our portfolio; we also continue to consider the impact of various factors in determining the allowance for credit losses on debt securities, which is discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans\nAs of December 31, 2024, our $1.4 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 45 fixed-rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower. These loans are carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their unpaid principal balance, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. As a result of increasing market interest rates since the majority of these loans were made, the carrying value exceeds the market value of these loans as of December 31, 2024. Given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash invested in the property generally ranging between 30 and 40%, we remain confident that the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms. For further discussion of the results and changes in key credit quality indicators, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOffice sector fundamentals have been and continue to be weak, and values are experiencing stress due to multiple headwinds: expanded work-from-home flexibility, shorter term leases, elevated tenant improvement allowances and corporate migration to lower cost states. Additionally, the current macroeconomic headwinds are impacting capital markets and reducing investor appetite for capital-intensive assets (e.g., offices and regional shopping malls). Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio has no exposure to regional shopping malls and approximately 25% exposure to office properties. Although future losses remain possible due to further credit deterioration, we do not expect these losses to have a material unfavorable effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nOther Long-Term Investments\nOther long-term investments of $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2024 included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships, direct investments in real estate joint ventures and other deposit activity that is required to support various insurance and health services businesses. These limited partnership entities typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies and equity real estate. Given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities, we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns. To mitigate risk, these investments are diversified by industry sector or property type and geographic region. No single partnership investment exceeded 3% of our securities and real estate limited partnership portfolio.\nWe expect continued volatility in private equity and real estate fund performance going forward as fair market valuations are adjusted to reflect market and portfolio transactions. Less than 4% of our other long-term investments are exposed to real estate in the office sector.\nUnconsolidated Subsidiary Investments Portfolio\nWe participate in an insurance joint venture in China with a 50% ownership interest. We account for this joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Our 50% share of the investment portfolio supporting the joint venture's liabilities was approximately $15.6 billion as of December 31, 2024. These investments were comprised of approximately 75% debt securities, including government and corporate debt diversified by issuer, industry and geography; 15% equities, including mutual funds, equity securities and private equity partnerships; and 10% long-term deposits and policy loans. We continuously review the joint venture's investment strategy and its execution. There were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of December 31, 2024. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unconsolidated subsidiaries.\n53\nMARKET RISK\nOur assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposure from financial instruments is our interest-rate risk exposure to fixed-rate, medium-term instruments. Changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return. \nConsistent with disclosure requirements, the following items have been excluded from this consideration of market risk for financial instruments: changes in the fair values of insurance-related assets and liabilities as disclosed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk); changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans (and related assets); and changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, taxes and various accrued liabilities (because they are not financial instruments, their primary risks are other than market risks).\nOur Management of Market Risks\nWe predominantly rely on two techniques to manage our exposure to market risk:\n•\nInvestment/liability matching.\n We generally select investment assets with characteristics (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity) that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations. Shorter-term investments generally support shorter-term life and health liabilities. Medium-term, fixed-rate investments support interest-sensitive and medium-term health liabilities. Longer-term investments generally support products with longer payout periods such as annuities.\n•\nUse of derivatives.\n We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our primary market risks. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.\nEffect of Market Fluctuations\nWe determine the sensitivity of market risk for our fixed income financial instruments, including debt securities and commercial mortgage loans, by estimating the present value of future cash flows using duration modeling and applying a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. The effect of these hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain noninsurance financial instruments would have been as follows:\nMarket scenario for certain noninsurance financial instruments\nLoss in Fair Value\n(in billions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n100 basis point increase in interest rates (excluding the Company's long-term debt)\n$\n0.6\n \n$\n0.7 \nIn the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt would decrease approximately $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Changes in the fair value of our long-term debt do not impact our financial position or operating results since long-term debt is not required to be recorded at fair value. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's debt.\nItem 7A.\n \nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe information contained under the caption \"Market Risk\" in the MD&A section of this Form 10-K is incorporated by reference.\n54\nItem 8. \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the\n \nBoard of Directors and Shareholders of The Cigna Group\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Cigna Group and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in total equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing on page FS-1 of this Form 10-K (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\").\n \nWe also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n55\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of incurred but not reported (IBNR) liabilities plus expected development on reported claims and reported claims in process for the Cigna Healthcare segment \nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the total of incurred but not reported (IBNR) liabilities plus expected development on reported claims and reported claims in process for the Cigna Healthcare segment as of December 31, 2024 was $4.6 billion. Management estimates the liability for claims incurred in each month by applying the current estimates of completion factors to the current paid claims data. As disclosed by management, the unpaid claims liability is primarily impacted by assumptions related to completion factors and medical cost trend. Management develops completion factors by comparing the claim incurral date to the date claims were paid. Completion factors are impacted by several key items including changes in: 1) electronic (auto-adjudication) versus manual claim processing; 2) frequency and timeliness of provider claims submissions; 3) number of customers and 4) the mix of products. Management uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors. Medical cost trend is primarily impacted by medical service utilization and unit costs. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of IBNR liabilities plus expected development on reported claims and reported claims in process for the Cigna Healthcare segment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of IBNR liabilities plus expected development on reported claims and reported claims in process for the Cigna Healthcare segment; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to completion factors and medical cost trend; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of IBNR liabilities plus expected development on reported claims and reported claims in process for the Cigna Healthcare segment, including controls over the development of significant assumptions related to completion factors and medical cost trend. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimate by performing one or a combination of procedures, including (a) developing an independent estimate of IBNR liabilities plus expected development on reported claims and reported claims in process for the Cigna Healthcare segment, and comparing the independent range of outcomes to management's estimate; (b) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s actuarial methodologies and the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions related to completion factors and medical cost trend by considering claims reporting and payment experience, historical trends, and other industry data; and (c) evaluating the consistency of management's actuarial methodologies period-over-period.\n/s/

with its subsidiaries (either individually or collectively referred to as the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\"), is a global health company committed to creating a better future for every individual and every community. We relentlessly challenge ourselves to partner and innovate solutions for better health. Powered by our people and our brands, we advance our mission to improve the health and vitality of those we serve. \nOur subsidiaries offer a differentiated set of pharmacy, medical, behavioral, dental, and related products and services. The majority of these products and services are offered through employers and other entities, such as governmental and nongovernmental organizations, unions and associations. Cigna Healthcare also offers health and dental insurance products to individuals in the United States and select international markets. In addition to these operations, The Cigna Group also has certain run-off operations.\nA full description of our segments follows:\nThe \nEvernorth Health Services\n reportable segment includes the Pharmacy Benefit Services and the Specialty and Care Services operating segments, which provide independent and coordinated health solutions and capabilities to enable the health care system to work better and help people live richer, healthier lives.\nPharmacy Benefit Services drives high-quality, cost-effective pharmacy care through various services such as drug claim adjudication, retail pharmacy network administration, benefit design consultation, drug utilization review, drug formulary management and access to our home delivery pharmacy. Specialty and Care Services provides specialty drugs for the treatment of complex and rare diseases, specialty distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, as well as clinical programs to help our clients drive better whole-person health outcomes through care services.\nThe \nCigna Healthcare\n reportable segment includes the U.S. Healthcare and International Health operating segments, which provide comprehensive medical and coordinated solutions to clients and customers. U.S. Healthcare provides medical plans and other benefits and solutions for insured clients, self-insured clients and individual health insurance plans. U.S. Healthcare also includes the Medicare Advantage and related businesses pending divestiture to Health Care Services Corporation (\"HCSC\") (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). International Health provides health care solutions in our international markets, as well as health care benefits for globally mobile individuals and employees of multinational organizations. \nOther Operations\n comprises the remainder of our business operations, which includes certain continuing (corporate-owned life insurance (\"COLI\")), run-off and other non-strategic businesses. Our run-off businesses include the (i) variable annuity reinsurance business that was effectively exited through reinsurance with Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\"Berkshire\") in 2013, (ii) settlement annuity business and (iii) individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses, which were sold through reinsurance agreements.\nCorporate \nreflects amounts not allocated to operating segments, including net interest expense (defined as interest on corporate financing less net investment income on investments not supporting segment and other operations), certain litigation matters, expense associated with our frozen pension plans, charitable contributions, operating severance, certain overhead and enterprise-wide project costs, and eliminations for products and services sold between segments.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    \nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Cigna Group and its consolidated subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. These Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Certain amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Note 20 \"Income Taxes\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation and did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAmounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements necessarily reflect management's estimates and assumptions about medical costs, investment, tax and receivable valuations, interest rates, and other factors. Significant estimates are discussed throughout these Notes; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. The impact of a change in estimate is generally included in earnings in the period of adjustment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThere were no new accounting standards adopted during the year ended December 31, 2024 that had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no significant accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2024.\n63\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe Company's accounting policies are described either in this Note or in the applicable Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as listed in the table of contents on page \n62\n.\nA.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost that approximates fair value. Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase. The Company reclassifies cash overdraft positions to liabilities when the legal right of offset does not exist.\nB.\nInventories\nInventories consist of prescription drugs and medical supplies and are stated at the lower of first-in-first-out cost or net realizable value.\nC.\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies\nThe Company generally conducts its international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies that are their functional currencies. The Company uses exchange rates as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars. Translation gains or losses on functional currencies, net of applicable taxes, are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company uses average monthly exchange rates during the year to translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars.\nD.\nPharmacy Revenues and Costs\nPharmacy Revenues\n.\n Pharmacy revenues are primarily derived from providing pharmacy benefit management services to clients and customers. Pharmacy revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to clients and customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive for those goods or services.\nThe Company provides or makes available various services supporting benefit management and claims administration and is generally obligated to provide prescription drugs to clients' members using multiple distribution methods, including retail networks, home delivery and specialty pharmacies. These goods and services are integrated into a single performance obligation to process claims, dispense prescription drugs and provide other services over the contract period (generally three years). This performance obligation is satisfied as the business stands ready to fulfill its obligation.\nRevenues for dispensing prescription drugs through retail pharmacies are reported gross and consist of the prescription price (ingredient cost and dispensing fee) contracted with clients, including the customer copayment, and any associated fees for services, because the Company acts as the principal in these arrangements. When a prescription is presented to a retail network pharmacy, the Company is solely responsible for customer eligibility, drug utilization review, drug-to-drug interaction review, any required clinical intervention, plan provision information, payment to the pharmacy and client billing. These revenues are recognized based on the full prescription price when the pharmacy claim is processed and approved for payment. The Company also provides benefit design and formulary consultation services to clients and negotiates separate contractual relationships with clients and network pharmacies. These factors indicate that the Company has control over these transactions until the prescription is processed. Revenues are billed, due and recognized at contract rates either on a periodic basis or as services are provided (such as based on volume of claims processed). This recognition pattern aligns with the benefits from services provided.\nHome delivery and specialty pharmacy revenues are due and recognized as each prescription is shipped, net of reserves for discounts and contractual allowances estimated based on historical experience. Any differences between estimates and actual collections are reflected in Pharmacy revenues when payments are received. Historically, adjustments to original estimates and returns have not been material. The Company has elected the practical expedient to account for shipping and handling as a fulfillment activity.\nWe may also provide certain financial and performance guarantees, including a minimum level of discounts a client may receive, generic utilization rates and various service levels. Clients may be entitled to receive compensation if we fail to meet the guarantees. Actual performance is compared to the contractual guarantee for each measure throughout the period and the Company defers revenue for any estimated payouts within Accrued expenses and other liabilities (current). These estimates are adjusted and paid at the end of the annual guarantee period. Historically, adjustments to original estimates have not been material. The liability for these financial and performance guarantees was $\n1.9\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n1.6\n billion as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company administers programs through which we may receive rebates and other vendor consideration from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The amounts of such rebates or other vendor consideration shared with pharmacy benefit management services clients \n64\nvary based on the contractual arrangement with the client and in some cases the type of consideration received from the pharmaceutical manufacturer. Rebates and other vendor consideration payable to pharmacy benefit management services clients are recorded as a reduction of Pharmacy revenues. Estimated amounts payable to clients are based on contractual sharing arrangements between the Company and the client and these amounts are adjusted when amounts are collected from pharmaceutical manufacturers in accordance with the contractual arrangement between the Company and the client. Historically, these adjustments have not been material.\nOther pharmacy service revenues are earned by distributing specialty pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to providers, clinics and hospitals. These revenues are billed, due and recognized at contracted rates as prescriptions and supplies are shipped and services are provided.\nPharmacy Costs\n.\n Pharmacy costs include the cost of prescriptions sold, network pharmacy claim costs and copayments. Also included are direct costs of dispensing prescriptions including supplies, shipping and handling, and direct costs associated with clinical programs, such as drug utilization management and medication adherence counseling. Home delivery and specialty pharmacy costs are recognized when the drug is shipped, and retail network costs are recognized when the drug is processed and approved for payment. Rebates and other vendor consideration received when providing pharmacy benefit management services are recorded as a reduction of pharmacy costs. Rebates are recognized as prescriptions are shipped or processed and approved for payment. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected, net of contractual allowances, has not been material. The Company maintains reimbursement guarantees with certain retail network pharmacies. For each such guarantee, the Company records a pharmacy and other service costs payable or prepaid asset for applicable retail network claims based on our actual performance throughout the period against the contractual reimbursement rate. The Company's contracts with certain retail pharmacies give the Company the right to adjust reimbursement rates during the annual guarantee period.\nE.\nPremiums and Related Expenses\nPremiums for short-duration group health, accident and life insurance and managed care coverages are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the contract period. Benefits and expenses are recognized when incurred and, for our Cigna Healthcare business, are presented net of pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates. For experience-rated contracts, premium revenue includes an adjustment for experience-rated refunds based on contract terms and calculated using the customer's experience (including estimates of incurred but not reported claims).\nPremiums received for the Company's Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Part D plans and Individual and Family Plans from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") and customers are recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period. \nCMS provides risk-adjusted premium payments for Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans based on our customer demographics and medical diagnoses, which may change from period to period based on the underlying health factors of our customers. The Company recognizes changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue adjustments are generally settled semiannually with CMS. The final revenue adjustment is generally settled with CMS in the year following the contract year.\nMedicare Part D premiums include payments from CMS for risk-sharing adjustments that are estimated quarterly based on claim experience by comparing actual incurred prescription drug costs to the estimated costs submitted in the original contracts. These adjustments may result in more or less revenue from CMS. Final revenue adjustments generally occur in the year following the contract year. \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") prescribed a risk adjustment program to mitigate the risk for participating health insurance companies selling individual coverage on the public exchanges. The risk adjustment program reallocates funds from insurers with lower risk populations to insurers with higher risk populations based on the relative risk scores of participants. We estimate our receivable or payable based on the risk of our customers compared to the risk of other customers in the same state and market, considering data obtained from industry studies and the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"). Receivables or payables are recorded as adjustments to premium revenue based on our year-to-date experience when the amounts are reasonably estimable and collection is reasonably assured. Final revenue adjustments are determined by HHS in the year following the policy year.\nPremium revenue may also include an adjustment to reflect the estimated effect of rebates due to customers under medical loss ratio provisions of the ACA. These rebate liabilities are settled in the subsequent year.\nLiabilities related to experience-rated refunds, risk adjustment programs and the minimum medical loss ratio are included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities (current). \n65\nPremiums for long-duration insurance contracts, including supplemental health, accident and individual life insurance and annuity products, and excluding universal life and investment-related products, are recognized as revenue when due. Cigna Healthcare long-duration premium revenues are associated with contracts that provide coverage greater than one year or are guaranteed to be renewed at the option of the policyholder beyond one year. Benefits and expenses are matched with premiums. \nRevenue for universal life products is recognized as follows:\n•\nInvestment income on assets supporting universal life products is recognized in Net investment income as earned.\n•\nCharges for mortality, administration and policy surrender are recognized in Premiums as earned. Administrative fees are considered earned when services are provided.\nBenefits and expenses for universal life products consist of benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances and income earned by policyholders. Expenses are recognized when claims are incurred and income is credited to policyholders in accordance with contract provisions.\nThe unrecognized portion of premiums received is recorded as unearned premiums included in Insurance and contractholder liabilities (current and non-current) (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information).\nF.\nFees and Related Expenses\nThe majority of the Company's service fee revenues are derived from the following programs:\n•\nAdministrative Services Only (\"ASO\") arrangements allow plan sponsors to self-fund claims and assume the risk of medical or other benefit costs. In return for fees from these clients, the Company provides access to our participating provider networks and other services supporting benefit management.\n•\nFee-for-service clinical solutions offered to clients, such as drug utilization management and medication adherence counseling help clients to drive better health outcomes at a lower cost by identifying and addressing potentially unsafe or wasteful prescribing, dispensing and utilization of prescription drugs, and communicating with, or supporting communications with, physicians, pharmacies and patients.\n•\nWholesale Marketplace Drug Formulary Management services include either our drug formulary administrative service arrangements or our formulary processing arrangements. Drug formulary administrative services may include formulary consultation, administration of rebate contracts, rebate submission, collection from drug manufacturers and the distribution of rebates to clients. Services may also include facilitating audits of data submissions and reporting of rebates to clients.\n•\nHealth benefit management solutions are offered primarily to sponsors of health benefit plans to drive cost reductions and improve quality outcomes for clients as well as provide behavioral health services to third-party health plans, employers and administrators. In certain arrangements, the Company assumes the financial obligation for third-party provider costs for medical services provided to the health plan's customers.\nArrangements are generally short-term (one year or less) except for certain three-year health benefit management solutions contracts, and each consists of a single performance obligation. Performance obligations are satisfied as services are provided to clients, either on a stand-ready or utilization basis. Fees are billed, due and recognized at contracted rates on a periodic basis, generally monthly or agreed-upon arrangements terms. Fee revenues for services are generally recorded on a gross basis with the associated direct and indirect costs presented in Pharmacy and other service costs, or Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nRetained rebates reported in Fees and other revenues in our formulary processing arrangements are either recognized gross as services are provided to clients, consistent with the related service fee, or net as rebates are processed. The latter applies in arrangements in which the Company is permitted to retain a portion of rebates collected in exchange for services, but the Company does not obtain control of the retained rebate until rebates are transferred to the client. \nFees for services may include variable consideration as a component of the transaction price, which is estimated at contract inception, recognized and adjusted through the contract period through Accrued expenses and other liabilities. Variable consideration includes certain health benefit management contracts requiring the Company to share the results of medical cost experience that differ from specified targets and ASO performance guarantees that compensate clients if certain service standards, clinical outcomes or financial metrics are not met.\nNote 3 – Accounts Receivable, Net\nAccounting Policy. \nWe bill pharmaceutical manufacturers based on management's interpretation of contractual terms and estimate a contractual allowance based on the best information available at the time a claim is processed. Contractual allowances for certain rebates receivable from pharmaceutical manufacturers are determined by reviewing payment experience and specific known items that \n66\ncould be adjusted under contract terms. The Company's estimation process for contractual allowances for pharmaceutical manufacturer receivables generally results in an allowance for balances outstanding greater than 90 days. \nContractual allowances for certain receivables from third-party payors are based on their contractual terms and are estimated based on the Company's best information available at the time revenue is recognized. \nThe allowance for expected credit losses for current accounts receivable is based primarily on past collections experience relative to the length of time receivables are past due; however, when available evidence reasonably supports an assumption that counterparty credit risk over the expected payment period will differ from current and historical payment collections, a forecasting adjustment is reflected in the allowance for expected credit losses.\nDiscounts and claims adjustments issued to customers in the form of client credits and other non-credit adjustments are based on the current status of each customer's receivable balance, current economic and market conditions and a variety of other factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of customers and our past experience. \nReceivables and any associated allowance are written off only when all collection attempts have failed and such amounts are determined unrecoverable. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances based on a variety of factors, including age of the outstanding receivable and collection history. When circumstances related to specific collection patterns change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables are adjusted.\nThe Company's accounts receivable include amounts due from clients, third-party payors, customers and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and are presented net of allowances. These balances include the following:\n•\nNoninsurance customer receivables - \namounts due from customers for noninsurance services, primarily pharmacy benefit management and ASO contracts.\n•\nPharmaceutical manufacturers receivables - \namounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers. \n•\nInsurance customer receivables - \namounts due from customers under insurance and managed care contracts, primarily premiums receivable and amounts due from CMS.\n•\nOther receivables - \nall other accounts receivable not included in the categories above.\nThe following amounts were included within Accounts receivable, net:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nNoninsurance customer receivables\n$\n11,879\n \n$\n8,044\n \nPharmaceutical manufacturers receivables\n10,914\n \n8,169\n \nInsurance customer receivables\n3,199\n \n2,359\n \nOther receivables\n162\n \n272\n \nTotal\n$\n26,154\n \n$\n18,844\n \nAccounts receivable, net classified as assets of businesses held for sale\n(\n1,927\n)\n(\n1,122\n)\nTotal\n$\n24,227\n \n$\n17,722\n \nThese receivables are reported net of our allowances of $\n5.0\n billion and $\n3.7\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, these allowances were primarily comprised of $\n4.3\n billion and $\n3.1\n billion, respectively, associated with contractual allowances for certain pharmaceutical manufacturers rebate receivables; $\n388\n million and $\n386\n million, respectively, associated with contractual allowances for third-party payor noninsurance customer receivables; and $\n84\n million and $\n90\n million, respectively, associated with allowances for current expected credit losses. The remaining allowances include discounts and claims adjustments issued to customers in the form of client credits and other non-credit adjustments. \nAccounts Receivable Factoring Facility\nThe Company maintains an uncommitted factoring facility (the \"Facility\") under which certain accounts receivable may be sold on a nonrecourse basis to a financial institution. The Facility began in July 2023 with an initial term of \ntwo years\n, followed by automatic \none-year\n renewal terms unless terminated by either party. The Facility's total capacity at inception was $\n1.0\n billion and was amended to $\n1.5\n billion in May 2024. \nThe transactions under the Facility are accounted for as a sale and recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets because control of, and risk related to, the accounts receivable are transferred to the financial institution. Although the sale is made without recourse, we provide collection services related to the transferred assets. Amounts associated with this Facility are reflected within Net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of \n67\nCash Flows. Factoring fees paid under this Facility are reflected in Interest expense and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe sold pharmaceutical manufacturers receivables under the Facility of $\n5.5\n billion and $\n2.1\n billion during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, factoring fees paid were not material. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all sold accounts receivable had been collected from pharmaceutical manufacturers and had been removed from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were $\n1.0\n billion and $\n515\n million, respectively, of collections from pharmaceutical manufacturers that had not been remitted to the financial institution. Such amounts are recorded within Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 4 – Supplier Finance Program\nThe Company facilitates a voluntary supplier finance program (the \"Program\") that provides suppliers the opportunity to sell their accounts receivable due from us (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to a financial institution, on a non-recourse basis, in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms require. The Cigna Group is not a party to the Program and agrees to commercial terms with its suppliers independently of their participation in the Program. Amounts due to suppliers that participate in the Program are generally paid within \none month\n following the invoice date. A supplier's participation in the Program has no impact on the Company's payment terms and the Company has no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the Program. The suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institution. No guarantees or pledged assets are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the Program.\nThe obligations confirmed as valid within the Program by the financial institutions were as follows and are reflected in \nAccounts payable\n in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the beginning of the year\n$\n1,536\n \n$\n1,303\n \nInvoices confirmed during the year\n39,091\n \n36,224\n \nLess: confirmed invoices paid during the year\n38,990\n \n35,991\n \nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the end of the year\n$\n1,637\n \n$\n1,536\n \nThe amounts confirmed as valid for both periods are predominately associated with one supplier. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have been informed by the financial institution that an immaterial amount of the Company's outstanding payment obligations were voluntarily elected by suppliers to be sold to the financial institution under the Program.\nNote 5 – Assets and Liabilities of Businesses Held for Sale\nAccounting Policy\n. The Company classifies assets and liabilities as held for sale (\"disposal group\") when management commits to a plan to sell the disposal group, the sale is probable within one year and the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. The Company considers various factors, particularly whether actions required to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Any loss resulting from the measurement is recognized in the period the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized until the date of the sale. When the disposal group is classified as held for sale, depreciation and amortization for most long-lived assets ceases and the Company tests the assets for impairment. Deferred policy acquisition costs continue to be amortized.\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Individual Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Plans, Medicare and Other Supplemental Benefits, and CareAllies businesses (the \"Disposal Group\") to HCSC subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, including purchase price adjustments to align with the final balance sheet of the divested businesses (the \"HCSC transaction\"). The initial $\n3.3\n billion purchase price is anticipated to increase at closing, reflecting higher statutory surplus for the legal entities that will convey to HCSC. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025.\nThe Company determined that the Disposal Group met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and aggregated and classified the assets and liabilities as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n68\nThe Company measured the assets and liabilities of the Disposal Group at estimated fair value less costs to sell based on an estimated $\n4.7\n billion purchase price as of December 31, 2024 and initial $\n3.3\n billion purchase price as of December 31, 2023 and recognized within \nNet gain (loss) on sale of businesses\n in the Consolidated Statements of Income an estimated loss of $\n472\n million pre-tax ($\n363\n million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $\n1.5\n billion pre-tax ($\n1.4\n billion after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The estimated loss on sale for both periods primarily represents goodwill impairments of $\n302\n million pre-tax in 2024 and $\n1.2\n billion pre-tax in 2023.\nThe assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale were as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,339\n \n$\n467\n \nInvestments\n1,444\n \n1,438\n \nAccounts receivable, net\n1,927\n \n1,122\n \nOther assets, including Goodwill \n(1)\n2,294\n \n2,963\n \nTotal assets of businesses held for sale\n7,004\n \n5,990\n \nInsurance and contractholder liabilities\n1,579\n \n1,636\n \nAll other liabilities\n831\n \n1,059\n \nTotal liabilities of businesses held for sale\n$\n2,410\n \n$\n2,695\n \n(1)\n Includes Goodwill of $\n94\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n396\n million\n \nas of December 31, 2023.\nIntegration and Transaction-Related Costs\nIn 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred transaction-related costs associated with the HCSC transaction. In 2023 and 2022, the Company also incurred net costs mainly related to the sale of our international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses. Additionally in 2022, the Company incurred costs related to the sale of the Group Disability and Life business as well as the acquisition of MDLIVE, Inc. (\"MD Live\"). These costs incurred consisted primarily of certain projects to separate or integrate the Company's systems, products and services; fees for legal, advisory and other professional services; and certain employment-related costs. These costs were $\n275\n million pre-tax ($\n211\n million after-tax), $\n45\n million pre-tax ($\n35\n million after-tax) and $\n135\n million pre-tax ($\n103\n million after-tax) for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nNote 6 – Earnings Per Share\nAccounting Policy. \nThe Company computes basic earnings per share using the weighted-average number of unrestricted common and deferred shares outstanding.

As of December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n outstanding balances under these revolving credit agreements.\n70\nIn April 2024, The Cigna Group replaced its previous revolving credit agreements and entered into the following (the \"Credit Agreements\"):\n•\nA $\n5.0\n billion \nfive-year\n revolving credit and letter of credit agreement that will mature in April 2029 with an option to extend the maturity date for additional \none-year\n periods, subject to consent of the banks. The Company can borrow up to $\n5.0\n billion under the credit agreement for general corporate purposes, with up to $\n500\n million available for issuance of letters of credit. \n•\nA $\n1.5\n billion \n364-day\n revolving credit agreement that will mature in April 2025. The Company can borrow up to $\n1.5\n billion under the credit agreement for general corporate purposes. This agreement includes the option to \"term out\" any revolving loans that are outstanding at maturity by converting them into a term loan maturing on the \none-year\n anniversary of conversion.\nEach of the Credit Agreements includes an option to increase commitments in an aggregate amount of up to $\n1.5\n billion across both facilities for a maximum total commitment of $\n8.0\n billion. The Credit Agreements allow for borrowings at either a base rate or an adjusted term Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\") plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the Company's senior unsecured credit ratings.\nEach facility also contains customary covenants and restrictions, including a financial covenant that the Company's leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreements, may not exceed \n60\n% subject to certain exceptions upon the consummation of an acquisition.\nCommercial Paper. \nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes privately placed on a discounted basis through certain broker-dealers at any time not to exceed an aggregate amount of $\n6.5\n billion. Our commercial paper program size was increased from $\n5.0\n billion to $\n6.5\n billion in July 2024. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The net proceeds of issuances have been and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The weighted average interest rate of our commercial paper was \n4.65\n% at December 31, 2024. \nLong-Term Debt\nDebt Issuance and Debt Tender Offers.\n In February 2024, we issued $\n4.5\n billion of new senior notes, as detailed in the table below. The proceeds from this debt were used to pay the consideration for the cash tender offers as described below. We used the remaining net proceeds to fund the repayment of our senior notes that matured in March 2024 and for general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness and repurchases of shares of our common stock.

Anticipated investment income is considered in the calculation of premium deficiency.\n \nB.\nUnpaid Claims and Claim Expenses – Cigna Healthcare\nThis liability reflects estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported, expected development on reported claims, claims that have been reported but not yet paid (reported claims in process) and other medical care expenses and services payable that are primarily comprised of accruals for incentives and other amounts payable to health care professionals and facilities. \nAccounting Policy. \nThe Company uses actuarial principles and assumptions that are consistently applied each reporting period and recognizes the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability along with a margin for adverse deviation. This approach is consistent with actuarial standards of practice that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse conditions. \nThe Company compares key assumptions used to establish the medical costs payable to actual experience for each reporting period. The unpaid claims liability is adjusted through current period Shareholders' net income when actual experience differs from these assumptions. Additionally, the Company evaluates expected future developments and emerging trends that may impact key assumptions. The process used to determine this liability requires the Company to make critical accounting estimates that involve considerable judgment, reflecting the variability inherent in forecasting future claim payments. These estimates are highly sensitive to changes in the Company's key assumptions, specifically completion factors and medical cost trend. \nThe liability is primarily calculated using \"completion factors\" developed by comparing the claim incurral date to the date claims were paid. Completion factors are impacted by several key items including changes in: 1) electronic (auto-adjudication) versus manual claim processing; 2) frequency and timeliness of provider claims submissions; 3) number of customers; and 4) the mix of products. The Company uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors. The Company estimates the liability for claims incurred in each month by applying the current \n73\nestimates of completion factors to the current paid claims data. This approach implicitly assumes that historical completion rates will be a useful indicator for the current period. \nThe Company relies more heavily on medical cost trend analysis that reflects expected claim payment patterns and other relevant operational considerations for more recent months. Medical cost trend is primarily impacted by medical service utilization and unit costs that are affected by changes in the level and mix of health benefits offered, including inpatient, outpatient and pharmacy; the impact of copays and deductibles; changes in provider practices; and changes in consumer demographics and consumption behavior.\nThe total of incurred but not reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims and reported claims in process was $\n4.6\n billion at December 31, 2024 and $\n4.8\n billion at December 31, 2023.\nActivity, net of intercompany transactions, in the unpaid claims liability for the Cigna Healthcare segment was as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024 \n(1)\n2023 \n(1)\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n5,092\n \n$\n4,176\n \n$\n4,261\n \nLess: Reinsurance and other amounts recoverable\n236\n \n221\n \n261\n \nBeginning balance, net\n4,856\n \n3,955\n \n4,000\n \nIncurred costs related to:\nCurrent year\n38,347\n \n35,953\n \n31,342\n \nPrior years\n(\n456\n)\n(\n279\n)\n(\n259\n)\nTotal incurred\n37,891\n \n35,674\n \n31,083\n \nPaid costs related to:\nCurrent year\n33,718\n \n31,322\n \n27,583\n \nPrior years\n4,170\n \n3,451\n \n3,545\n \nTotal paid\n37,888\n \n34,773\n \n31,128\n \nEnding balance, net\n4,859\n \n4,856\n \n3,955\n \nAdd: Reinsurance and other amounts recoverable\n159\n \n236\n \n221\n \nEnding balance\n$\n5,018\n \n$\n5,092\n \n$\n4,176\n \n(1)\n Includes unpaid claims amounts classified as liabilities of businesses held for sale.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on reinsurance.\nVariances in incurred costs related to prior years' unpaid claims and claim expenses that resulted from the differences between actual experience and the Company's key assumptions were as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(Dollars in millions)\n$\n% \n(1)\n$\n% \n(2)\nActual completion factors and other\n$\n223\n \n0.6\n \n%\n$\n70\n \n0.2\n \n%\nMedical cost trend\n233\n \n0.7\n \n209\n \n0.7\n \nTotal favorable variance\n$\n456\n \n1.3\n \n%\n$\n279\n \n0.9\n \n%\n(1)\nPercentage of current year incurred costs as reported for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n(2)\nPercentage of current year incurred costs as reported for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFavorable prior year development in both years primarily reflects lower than expected utilization of medical services as compared to our assumptions.\n74\nThe following table depicts the incurred and paid claims development and unpaid claims liability as of December 31, 2024 (net of reinsurance) reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment. The information about incurred and paid claims development for the year ended December 31, 2023 is presented as supplementary information and is unaudited.\n \nIncurred Costs\n \nIncurral Year\n2023\n(Unaudited)\n2024\nUnpaid Claims and Claim Expenses\n(In millions)\n \n \n2023\n$\n34,878\n \n$\n34,437\n \n213\n \n2024\n37,179\n \n4,460\n \nCumulative incurred costs for the periods presented\n$\n71,616\n \n \n \nCumulative Costs Paid\n \nIncurral Year\n2023\n(Unaudited)\n2024\n \n(In millions)\n2023\n$\n30,380\n \n$\n34,224\n \n \n2024\n32,719\n \n \nCumulative paid costs for the periods presented\n$\n66,943\n \n \nOutstanding liabilities for the periods presented, net of reinsurance\n$\n4,673\n \n \nOther long-duration liabilities not included in development table above\n186\n \n \nNet unpaid claims and claims expenses - Cigna Healthcare\n4,859\n \n \nReinsurance and other amounts recoverable\n159\n \n \nUnpaid claims and claim expenses - Cigna Healthcare\n$\n5,018\n \n \nIncurred claims do not typically remain outstanding for multiple years; more than \n95\n% of health claims incurred in a year are paid by the end of the following year.\nThere is no single or common claim frequency metric used in the health care industry. The Company believes a relevant metric for its health insurance business is the number of customers for whom an insured medical claim was paid. Customers for whom no insured medical claim was paid are excluded from the calculation. Claims that did not result in a liability are not included in the frequency metric.\n The claim frequency for 2024 and 2023 was approximately \n5.3\n million and \n5.5\n million, respectively.\nC.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nAccounting Policy.\n Future policy benefits represent the present value of estimated future obligations, estimated using actuarial methods, for long-duration insurance policies and annuity products currently in force, consisting primarily of reserves for annuity contracts, life insurance benefits and certain supplemental health products that are guaranteed renewable beyond one year.\nContracts are grouped at a level no higher than issue year, based on the original contract issue date, and at lower levels of disaggregation within each issue year for certain businesses to reflect factors including product type, plan type and currency. Management estimates these obligations based on assumptions for premiums, interest rates, mortality or morbidity, future claim adjudication expenses and surrenders. Mortality, morbidity and surrender assumptions are based on the Company's own experience and published actuarial tables and are updated at least annually, to the extent changes in circumstances require. Interest rate assumptions are based on\n \nmarket-level yields for low credit risk fixed income instruments (\"upper-medium grade fixed income instrument\"). For interest accretion purposes, interest rates are fixed at the year of the cohort's inception; however, for purposes of liability measurement, they are updated to the current rate quarterly, with all changes in the interest rate from inception to current period reported through Accumulated other comprehensive loss. For contracts issued domestically, we use observable inputs from a published spot rate curve for terms up to \n30\n years and extrapolate for longer terms using a constant forward rate approach. For contracts issued by foreign operating entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, we use observable inputs to approximate a risk free rate and add a credit spread adjustment to align with a low-credit risk fixed income instrument. For terms beyond the last observable risk free rates, which vary by international market, we extrapolate to the ultimate forward rate assuming a constant credit spread.\nFor the annuity business, the premium paying period is shorter than the benefit coverage period, and a deferred profit liability is reported in future policy benefits representing gross premium received in excess of net premiums. Deferred profit liability is amortized based on expected future benefit payments.\n75\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately \n34\n% of the liability for future policy benefits, excluding amounts held for sale, was supported by assets in trust for the benefit of the ceding company under reinsurance agreements.\nCigna Healthcare\nThe weighted average interest rates applied and duration for future policy benefits in the Cigna Healthcare segment, consisting primarily of supplemental health products including individual Medicare supplement, limited benefit health products and individual private medical insurance, were as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nInterest accretion rate \n2.85\n \n%\n2.54\n \n%\nCurrent discount rate \n5.10\n \n%\n4.92\n \n%\nWeighted average duration \n8.7\n years\n7.9\n years\nThe net liability for future policy benefits for the segment's supplemental health products represents the present value of benefits expected to be paid to policyholders, net of the present value of expected net premiums, which is the portion of expected future gross premium expected to be collected from policyholders that is required to provide for all expected future benefits and expenses.\n \nThe present values of expected net premiums and expected future policy benefits for the Cigna Healthcare segment were as follows: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024 \n(1)\n2023\nPresent value of expected net premiums\nBeginning balance\n$\n9,233\n \n$\n8,557\n \nReversal of effect of beginning of period discount rate assumptions\n1,154\n \n1,537\n \nEffect of assumption changes and actual variances from expected experience \n(2)\n5\n \n314\n \nIssuances and lapses \n1,982\n \n1,255\n \nNet premiums collected\n(\n1,441\n)\n(\n1,370\n)\nInterest and other \n(3)\n752\n \n94\n \nEnding balance at original discount rate\n11,685\n \n10,387\n \nEffect of end of period discount rate assumptions\n(\n1,232\n)\n(\n1,154\n)\nEnding balance\n (4)\n$\n10,453\n \n$\n9,233\n \nPresent value of expected policy benefits\nBeginning balance\n$\n9,633\n \n$\n8,945\n \nReversal of effect of discount rate assumptions\n1,220\n \n1,611\n \nEffect of assumption changes and actual variances from expected experience \n(2)\n204\n \n112\n \nIssuances and lapses \n1,893\n \n1,309\n \nBenefit payments\n(\n1,473\n)\n(\n1,374\n)\nInterest and other \n(3)\n668\n \n250\n \nEnding balance at original discount rate\n12,145\n \n10,853\n \nEffect of discount rate assumptions\n(\n1,309\n)\n(\n1,220\n)\nEnding balance \n(5)\n$\n10,836\n \n$\n9,633\n \nLiability for future policy benefits \n$\n383\n \n$\n400\n \nOther\n (6)\n215\n \n215\n \nTotal liability for future policy benefits \n(1)(7)\n$\n598\n \n$\n615\n \n(1)\nIncludes $\n408\n million and $\n429\n million\n \nof future policy benefits classified as liabilities of businesses held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes the effect of actual variances from expectations, which decreased the total liability for future policy benefits by $(\n44\n) million and $(\n12\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(3)\nIncludes the foreign exchange rate impact of translating from transactional and functional currency to United States dollar and the impact of flooring the liability at zero. The flooring impact is calculated at the cohort level after discounting the reserves at the current discount rate.\n(4)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, undiscounted expected future gross premiums were $\n21.4\n billion and $\n18.7\n billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, discounted expected future gross premiums were $\n14.3\n billion and $\n13.5\n billion, respectively.\n(5)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, undiscounted expected future policy benefits were $\n16.1\n billion and $\n13.3\n billion, respectively.\n(6)\nThe liability for future policyholder benefits includes immaterial businesses shown as reconciling items above, most of which are in run-off. \n76\n(7)\n$\n85\n million and $\n72\n million reported in Reinsurance recoverables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, relate to the liability for future policy benefits. Additionally, $\n80\n million and $\n79\n million\n \nof reinsurance recoverables are reported in assets of businesses held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nOther Operations\nThe weighted average interest rates applied and duration for future policy benefits in Other Operations, consisting of annuity and life insurance products, were as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nInterest accretion rate \n5.64\n \n%\n5.64\n \n%\nCurrent discount rate \n5.42\n \n%\n4.87\n \n%\nWeighted average duration \n10.8\n years\n11.4\n years\nObligations for annuities represent discounted periodic benefits to be paid to an individual or groups of individuals over their remaining lives. Other Operations\n'\n traditional insurance contracts, which are in run-off, have no premium remaining to be collected; therefore, future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of expected future policy benefits, discounted using the current discount rate, and the remaining amortizable deferred profit liability.\nFuture policy benefits for Other Operations includes deferred profit liability of $\n366\n million and $\n384\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, future policy benefits excluding deferred profit liability were $\n2.9\n billion, $\n3.2\n billion and $\n3.2\n billion, respectively. The decrease in future policy benefit reserves as of December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by benefit payments and current discount rate increases. Undiscounted expected future policy benefits were $\n4.3\n billion and $\n4.5\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $\n0.9\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion, respectively, of the future policy benefit reserve was recoverable through treaties with external reinsurers.\nD.\nContractholder Deposit Funds\nAccounting Policy. \nLiabilities for contractholder deposit funds primarily include deposits received from customers for investment-related and universal life products as well as investment earnings on their fund balances in Other Operations. These liabilities are adjusted to reflect administrative charges and, for universal life fund balances, mortality charges. Interest credited on these funds is accrued ratably over the contract period.\n \nContractholder deposit fund liabilities within Other Operations were $\n6.3\n billion, $\n6.5\n billion and $\n6.7\n billion as of December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Approximately \n38\n% of the balance is reinsured externally as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Activity in these liabilities is presented net of reinsurance in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The net year-to-date decrease in contractholder deposit fund liabilities generally relates to withdrawals and benefit payments from contractholder deposit funds, partially offset by deposits and interest credited to contractholder deposit funds.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the weighted average crediting rate, net amount at risk and cash surrender value for contractholder deposit fund liabilities not effectively exited through reinsurance were \n3.33\n%, $\n2.8\n billion and $\n2.8\n billion, respectively. The comparative amounts as of December 31, 2023 were \n3.31\n%, $\n3.0\n billion and $\n2.8\n billion, respectively. More than \n99\n% of the $\n4.0\n billion liability, as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, not reinsured externally is for contracts with guaranteed interest rates of \n3\n% - \n4\n%, and approximately $\n1.2\n billion as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, represented contracts with policies at the guarantee. As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $\n1.2\n billion was \n50\n-\n150\n basis points (\"bps\") above the guarantee and the remaining $\n1.6\n billion represented contracts above the guarantee that pay the policyholder based on the greater of a guaranteed minimum cash value or the actual cash value. As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, more than \n90\n% of these contracts have actual cash values of at least 110% of the guaranteed cash value.\nE.\nMarket Risk Benefits\nLiabilities for market risk benefits (\"MRBs\") consist of variable annuity reinsurance contracts in Other Operations. These liabilities arise under annuities and riders to annuities written by ceding companies that guarantee the benefit received at death and, for a subset of policies, also provide contractholders the option, within \n30\n days of a policy anniversary after the appropriate waiting period, to elect minimum income payments. The Company's capital market risk exposure on variable annuity reinsurance contracts arises when the reinsured guaranteed minimum benefit exceeds the contractholder's account value in the related underlying mutual funds at the time \n77\nthe insurance benefit is payable under the respective contract. The Company receives and pays premium periodically based on the terms of the reinsurance agreements.\nAccounting Policy.\n Variable annuity reinsurance liabilities are measured as MRBs at fair value, net of nonperformance risk, with fluctuations in value gross of reinsurer nonperformance risk reported in benefit expenses, while fluctuations in the Company's own nonperformance risk (own credit risk) are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Nonperformance risk reflects risk that a party might default and therefore not fulfill its obligations (i.e., nonpayment risk). The nonperformance risk adjustment reflects a market participant's view of nonpayment risk by adding an additional spread to the discount rate in the calculation of both (a) the variable annuity reinsurance liabilities to be paid by the Company and (b) the variable annuity reinsurance assets to be paid by the reinsurers, after considering collateral. The Company classifies variable annuity assets and liabilities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements because assumptions related to future annuitant behavior are largely unobservable. As discussed further in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, due to the reinsurance agreements covering these liabilities, the liabilities do not generally impact net income except for the change in nonperformance risk on the reinsurance recoverable, which is reported in benefit expenses and does not offset the nonperformance risk valuation on the liability. Variable annuity liabilities are established using capital market assumptions and assumptions related to future annuitant behavior (including mortality, lapse and annuity election rates).\n \nMarket risk benefits activity was as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n1,003\n \n$\n1,268\n \nBalance, beginning of year, before the effect of nonperformance risk (own credit risk)\n1,085\n \n1,379\n \nChanges due to expected run-off\n(\n12\n)\n(\n19\n)\nChanges due to capital markets versus expected\n(\n233\n)\n(\n254\n)\nChanges due to policyholder behavior versus expected\n(\n39\n)\n(\n5\n)\nAssumption changes\n37\n \n(\n16\n)\nBalance, end of period, before the effect of changes in nonperformance risk (own credit risk)\n838\n \n1,085\n \nNonperformance risk (own credit risk), end of period\n(\n53\n)\n(\n82\n)\nBalance, end of period\n$\n785\n \n$\n1,003\n \nReinsured market risk benefit, end of period\n$\n836\n \n$\n1,081\n \nThe following table presents the account value, net amount at risk, average attained age of contractholders (weighted by exposure) and the number of contractholders for guarantees assumed by the Company. The net amount at risk is the amount that the Company would have to pay to contractholders if all deaths or annuitizations occurred as of the earliest possible date in accordance with the insurance contract. As of December 31, 2024, the account value increased primarily due to favorable equity market performance, which resulted in a decrease to the net amount at risk. The Company should be reimbursed in full for these payments unless the Berkshire reinsurance limit is exceeded.\n(Dollars in millions, excludes impact of reinsurance ceded)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAccount value\n$\n7,777\n \n$\n7,736\n \nNet amount at risk\n$\n1,283\n \n$\n1,609\n \nAverage attained age of contractholders (weighted by exposure)\n77.7\n years\n77.3\n years\nNumber of contractholders (estimated)\n130,000\n \n140,000\n \nNote 10 – Reinsurance\nThe Company's insurance subsidiaries enter into agreements with other insurance companies to limit losses from large exposures and to permit recovery of a portion of incurred losses. Reinsurance is ceded primarily in acquisition and disposition transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired. Reinsurance does not relieve the originating insurer of liability. Therefore, reinsured liabilities must continue to be reported along with the related reinsurance recoverables. The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of its credit risk. \n \nAccounting Policy. \nReinsurance recoverables represent amounts due from reinsurers for both paid and unpaid claims of the Company's insurance businesses. The Company bears the risk of loss if its reinsurers and retrocessionaires do not meet or are unable to meet their reinsurance obligations to the Company. Most reinsurance recoverables are classified as non-current assets. The current portion of reinsurance recoverables is reported in Other current assets and consists primarily of recoverables on paid claims expected to be settled within one year. Reinsurance recoverables are presented net of allowances, consisting primarily of an allowance for expected credit losses, which is recognized on reinsurance recoverable balances each period and adjusted through Medical costs and other benefit expenses. Estimates of the allowance for expected credit losses are based on internal and external data used to develop expected loss rates over the anticipated duration of the recoverable asset that vary by external credit rating and collateral level.\nCollateral levels are defined internally based on the fair value of the collateral relative to the carrying amount of the reinsurance recoverable, the frequency at which collateral is required to be replenished and the potential for volatility in the collateral's fair value. \n \n \nThe Company's reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2024 are presented at amount due by range of external credit rating and collateral level in the following table, with reinsurance recoverables that are market risk benefits separately presented at fair value:\n(In millions)\nFair Value of Collateral Contractually Required to Meet or Exceed Carrying Value of Recoverable\nCollateral Provisions Exist That May Mitigate Risk of Credit Loss \n(1)\nNo Collateral\nTotal\nOngoing Operations\nA- equivalent and higher current ratings \n(2)\n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n233\n \n$\n240\n \nBBB- to BBB+ equivalent current credit ratings\n (2)\n—\n \n—\n \n63\n \n63\n \nNot rated\n144\n \n1\n \n3\n \n148\n \nAcquisition, disposition or run-off activities\nBBB+ equivalent and higher current ratings \n(2)(3)\n476\n \n2,854\n \n136\n \n3,466\n \nNot rated\n—\n \n6\n \n3\n \n9\n \nTotal reinsurance recoverables before market risk benefits\n$\n620\n \n$\n2,868\n \n$\n438\n \n$\n3,926\n \nAllowance for uncollectible reinsurance\n(\n30\n)\nMarket risk benefits\n836\n \nTotal reinsurance recoverables \n(4)\n$\n4,732\n \n(1)\nIncludes collateral provisions requiring the reinsurer to fully collateralize its obligation if its external credit rating is downgraded to a specified level.\n(2)\nCertified by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organization (\"NRSRO\").\n(3)\nComprised of \n21\n reinsurers of which \n73\n%\n \nis held by two reinsurers, Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and Lincoln Life and Annuity Company of New York.\n(4)\nIncludes $\n159\n million of current reinsurance recoverables that are reported in Other current assets and $\n195\n million of reinsurance recoverables classified as assets of businesses held for sale.\nThe Company entered into an agreement with Berkshire to effectively exit the variable annuity reinsurance business via a reinsurance transaction in 2013. \nVariable annuity contracts are accounted for as assumed and ceded reinsurance and categorized as market risk benefits as discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n Berkshire reinsured \n100\n% of the Company's future cash flows in this business, net of other reinsurance arrangements existing at that time. The reinsurance agreement is subject to an overall limit with approximately $\n3.0\n billion remaining at December 31, 2024. As a result of the reinsurance transaction, amounts payable are offset by a corresponding reinsurance recoverable, provided the increased recoverable remains within the overall Berkshire limit. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, market risk benefits (shown in the table net of nonperformance risk as of December 31, 2024) are predominantly reinsured by Berkshire, which is rated AA+ by an NRSRO. Approximately \n95\n% of the Berkshire recoverable is secured by assets in a trust. \nEffects of Reinsurance\nTotal short-duration contract premiums (direct, assumed and ceded) were $\n43.9\n billion, $\n42.3\n billion and $\n36.9\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total long-duration contract premiums (direct, assumed and ceded) were $\n2.0\n billion, $\n1.9\n billion and $\n3.0\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Reinsurance recoveries of $\n573\n million, $\n456\n million and $\n702\n million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, have been netted against Medical costs and other benefit expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. \nBoth short- and long-duration premiums are primarily direct premiums; the amounts assumed and ceded were not material. Total short-duration contract written premiums were $\n42.6\n billion, $\n41.1\n billion\n \nand $\n35.0\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \n79\nNote 11 – Investments\nThe following table summarizes the Company's investments by category and current or long-term classification:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions)\nCurrent\nLong-Term\nTotal\nCurrent\nLong-Term\nTotal\nDebt securities\n$\n463\n \n$\n8,960\n \n$\n9,423\n \n$\n590\n \n$\n9,265\n \n$\n9,855\n \nEquity securities\n7\n \n554\n \n561\n \n31\n \n3,331\n \n3,362\n \nCommercial mortgage loans\n108\n \n1,243\n \n1,351\n \n182\n \n1,351\n \n1,533\n \nPolicy loans\n—\n \n1,156\n \n1,156\n \n—\n \n1,211\n \n1,211\n \nOther long-term investments\n—\n \n4,576\n \n4,576\n \n—\n \n4,181\n \n4,181\n \nShort-term investments\n170\n \n—\n \n170\n \n206\n \n—\n \n206\n \nTotal\n$\n748\n \n$\n16,489\n \n$\n17,237\n \n$\n1,009\n \n$\n19,339\n \n$\n20,348\n \nInvestments classified as assets of businesses held for sale \n(1)\n(\n83\n)\n(\n1,361\n)\n(\n1,444\n)\n(\n84\n)\n(\n1,354\n)\n(\n1,438\n)\nInvestments per Consolidated Balance Sheets\n$\n665\n \n$\n15,128\n \n$\n15,793\n \n$\n925\n \n$\n17,985\n \n$\n18,910\n \n(1)\n Investments related to the HCSC transaction that were held for sale as of December 31, 2024. These investments were primarily comprised of debt securities.\nAccounting Policy.\n Debt securities, commercial mortgage loans, derivative financial instruments and short-term investments with contractual maturities during the next 12 months are classified on the balance sheet as current investments, unless they are held as statutory deposits or restricted for other purposes and then they are classified as Long-term investments. Equity securities may include funds that are used in our cash management strategy and are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as Long-term investments. See Note 12 for information about the valuation of the Company's investment portfolio.\nA.\nInvestment Portfolio\nDebt Securities\nAccounting Policy.\n Debt securities (including bonds, mortgage and other asset-backed securities, and preferred stocks redeemable by the investor) are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded either in Accumulated other comprehensive loss within Shareholders' equity or in credit loss expense based on fluctuations in the allowance for credit losses, as further discussed below. When the Company intends to sell or determines that it is more likely than not to be required to sell an impaired debt security, the excess of amortized cost over fair value is directly written down with a charge to Net investment losses. Certain asset-backed securities are considered variable interest entities. See Note 13 for additional information. \nThe Company reviews declines in fair value from a debt security's amortized cost basis to determine whether a credit loss exists and, when appropriate, recognizes a credit loss allowance with a corresponding charge to credit loss expense, presented in Net investment losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for credit loss represents the excess of amortized cost over the greater of its fair value or the net present value of the debt security's projected future cash flows (based on qualitative and quantitative factors, including the probability of default and the estimated timing and amount of recovery). Each period, the allowance for credit loss is adjusted as needed through credit loss expense.\nThe Company does not measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. When interest payments are delinquent based on contractual terms or when certain terms (interest rate or maturity date) of the investment have been restructured, accrued interest, reported in Other current assets, is written off through a charge to Net investment income and interest income is recognized on a cash basis.\nThe amortized cost and fair value by contractual maturity periods for debt securities were as follows as of December 31, 2024:\n(In millions)\nAmortized\nCost\nFair\nValue\nDue in one year or less\n$\n622\n \n$\n553\n \nDue after one year through five years\n3,927\n \n3,759\n \nDue after five years through ten years\n3,164\n \n2,960\n \nDue after ten years\n2,041\n \n1,813\n \nMortgage and other asset-backed securities\n371\n \n338\n \nTotal\n$\n10,125\n \n$\n9,423\n \nActual maturities of these securities could differ from their contractual maturities used in the table above because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without penalties.\n80\nGross unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on debt securities by type of issuer is shown below:\n(In millions)\nAmortized\nCost\nAllowance for Credit Loss\nUnrealized\nAppreciation\nUnrealized\nDepreciation\nFair\nValue\nDecember 31, 2024\nFederal government and agency\n$\n276\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n(\n9\n)\n$\n281\n \nState and local government\n37\n \n—\n \n1\n \n(\n1\n)\n37\n \nForeign government\n350\n \n—\n \n5\n \n(\n11\n)\n344\n \nCorporate\n9,091\n \n(\n111\n)\n102\n \n(\n659\n)\n8,423\n \nMortgage and other asset-backed\n371\n \n—\n \n1\n \n(\n34\n)\n338\n \nTotal\n$\n10,125\n \n$\n(\n111\n)\n$\n123\n \n$\n(\n714\n)\n$\n9,423\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nFederal government and agency\n$\n251\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n267\n \nState and local government\n37\n \n—\n \n2\n \n(\n1\n)\n38\n \nForeign government\n355\n \n—\n \n10\n \n(\n13\n)\n352\n \nCorporate\n9,338\n \n(\n33\n)\n158\n \n(\n630\n)\n8,833\n \nMortgage and other asset-backed\n398\n \n—\n \n1\n \n(\n34\n)\n365\n \nTotal\n$\n10,379\n \n$\n(\n33\n)\n$\n195\n \n$\n(\n686\n)\n$\n9,855\n \nReview of Declines in Fair Value. \nManagement reviews debt securities in an unrealized loss position to determine whether a credit loss allowance is needed based on criteria that include severity of decline; financial health and specific prospects of the issuer; and changes in the regulatory, economic or general market environment of the issuer's industry or geographic region.\nThe table below summarizes debt securities with a decline in fair value from amortized cost for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded (by investment grade and the length of time these securities have been in an unrealized loss position). Unrealized depreciation on these debt securities is primarily due to declines in fair value resulting from increasing interest rates since these securities were purchased. \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\nFair\nValue\nAmortized\nCost\nUnrealized\nDepreciation\nNumber\nof Issues\nFair\nValue\nAmortized\nCost\nUnrealized\nDepreciation\nNumber\nof Issues\nOne year or less\nInvestment grade\n$\n1,203\n \n$\n1,227\n \n$\n(\n24\n)\n545\n$\n330\n \n$\n338\n \n$\n(\n8\n)\n142\n \nBelow investment grade\n245\n \n250\n \n(\n5\n)\n739\n161\n \n170\n \n(\n9\n)\n135\n \nMore than one year\nInvestment grade\n4,687\n \n5,319\n \n(\n632\n)\n1,297\n5,441\n \n6,036\n \n(\n595\n)\n1,590\n \nBelow investment grade\n416\n \n469\n \n(\n53\n)\n123\n701\n \n775\n \n(\n74\n)\n486\n \nTotal\n$\n6,551\n \n$\n7,265\n \n$\n(\n714\n)\n2,704\n \n$\n6,633\n \n$\n7,319\n \n$\n(\n686\n)\n2,353\n \nEquity Securities\nAccounting Policy\n. Equity securities with a readily determinable fair value consist primarily of public equity investments in the health care sector and mutual funds that invest in fixed income debt securities while those without a readily determinable fair value consist of private equity investments. Changes in the fair values of equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value are reported in Net investment losses. Equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are carried at cost minus impairment plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes. \nThe following table provides the values of the Company's equity security investments:\nDecember 31, 2024 \nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions)\n Cost\nCarrying Value\n Cost\nCarrying Value\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values\n$\n635\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n656\n \n$\n51\n \nEquity securities with no readily determinable fair value\n3,215\n \n524\n \n3,248\n \n3,311\n \nTotal\n$\n3,850\n \n$\n561\n \n$\n3,904\n \n$\n3,362\n \nWe are a minority owner in VillageMD, a provider of primary, multi-specialty and urgent care services that is majority-owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. These securities are included in equity securities with no readily determinable fair value in the above \n81\ntable. We determined our investment in VillageMD was fully impaired and recorded a $\n2.7\n billion loss in Net investment losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans\nAccounting Policy.\n \nCommercial mortgage loans are carried at unpaid principal balances, net of an allowance for expected credit losses, and classified as either current or long-term investments based on their contractual maturities. Changes in the allowance for expected credit losses are recognized as credit loss expense and presented in Net investment losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. \nEach period, the Company establishes (or adjusts) its allowance for expected credit losses for commercial mortgage loans. The allowance for expected credit losses is based on a credit risk category that is assigned to each loan at origination using key credit quality indicators, including debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios. Credit risk categories are updated as key credit quality indicators change. An expected loss rate, assigned based on the credit risk category, is applied to each loan's unpaid principal balance to develop the aggregate allowance for expected credit losses. Commercial mortgage loans are considered impaired and written off against the allowance when it is probable that the Company will not collect all amounts due per the terms of the promissory note. In the event of a foreclosure, the allowance for credit losses is based on the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over the fair value of its underlying collateral.\nMortgage loans held by the Company are made exclusively to commercial borrowers and are diversified by property type, location and borrower. Loans are generally issued at fixed rates of interest and are secured by high-quality, primarily completed and substantially leased operating properties.\nCredit Quality\n.\n The Company regularly evaluates and monitors credit risk. Mortgage origination professionals employ an internal credit quality rating system designed to evaluate the relative risk of the transaction at origination that is then updated each year as part of the annual portfolio loan review. The Company evaluates and monitors credit quality on a consistent and ongoing basis. The annual portfolio review performed in the second quarter of 2024 confirmed ongoing strong overall credit quality in line with the previous year's results.\nQuality ratings are based on our evaluation of a number of key inputs related to the loan. The two most significant contributors to the credit quality rating are the debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios. The debt service coverage ratio measures the amount of property cash flow available to meet annual interest and principal payments on debt, with a ratio below 1.0 indicating that there is not enough cash flow to cover the required loan payments. The loan-to-value ratio, commonly expressed as a percentage, compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan.\nThe following table summarizes the credit risk profile of the Company's commercial mortgage loan portfolio:\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nLoan-to-Value Ratio\nCarrying Value\nAverage Debt Service Coverage Ratio\nAverage Loan-to-Value Ratio\nCarrying Value\nAverage Debt Service Coverage Ratio\nAverage Loan-to-Value Ratio\nBelow 60%\n$\n547\n \n2.07\n$\n802\n \n2.13\n60% to 79%\n595\n \n1.83\n574\n \n1.77\n80% to 100%\n209\n \n0.51\n157\n \n0.65\nTotal\n$\n1,351\n \n1.70\n69\n \n%\n$\n1,533\n \n1.82\n64\n \n%\nPolicy Loans\nAccounting Policy\n. Policy loans, primarily associated with our corporate-owned life insurance business, are carried at unpaid principal balances plus accumulated interest, the total of which approximates fair value. These loans are collateralized by life insurance policy cash values and therefore have minimal exposure to credit loss. Interest rates are reset annually based on a rolling average of benchmark interest rates.\nOther Long-Term Investments\nAccounting Policy. \nOther long-term investments include investments in unconsolidated entities, including certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies holding real estate, securities or loans, and health care-related investments. These investments are carried at cost plus the Company's ownership percentage of reporting income or loss, based on the financial statements of the \n82\nunderlying investments that are generally reported at fair value. Income or loss from these investments is reported on a one-quarter lag due to the timing of when financial information is received from the general partner or manager of the investments. \nOther long-term investments also include investment real estate carried at depreciated cost less any impairment write-downs to fair value when cash flows indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Depreciation is generally recorded using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset. Investment real estate as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is expected to be held longer than one year and may include real estate acquired through the foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans.\nAdditionally, foreign currency swaps carried at fair value and certain restricted deposits are reported in the table below as \"Other.\" See discussion below for information on the Company's accounting policies for derivative financial instruments.\nOther long-term investments and related commitments are diversified by issuer, property type and geographic regions. These investments are primarily unconsolidated variable interest entities (see Note 13 for additional information).\n \nThe following table provides unfunded commitment and carrying value information for these investments. The Company expects to disburse approximately \n31\n% of the committed amounts in 2025. \nOur limited partnership investments are reduced as the Company receives cash distributions for returns on its investment that were previously recognized in Net investment income. \nThe amount of these cash distributions was $\n344\n million in 2024, $\n253\n million in 2023 and $\n487\n million in 2022. \nUnfunded Commitments as of\nCarrying Value as of December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nReal estate investments\n$\n1,763\n \n$\n1,606\n \n$\n850\n \nSecurities partnerships\n2,587\n \n2,400\n \n1,809\n \nOther\n226\n \n175\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n4,576\n \n$\n4,181\n \n$\n2,659\n \nShort-Term Investments\nAccounting Policy. \nSecurity investments with maturities of greater than three months to one year from time of purchase are classified as short-term, available for sale and carried at fair value that approximates cost.\nConcentration of Risk\nThe Company did not have a concentration of investments in a single issuer or borrower exceeding 10% of shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nB.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage the characteristics of investment assets (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity) to meet the varying demands of the related insurance and contractholder liabilities. The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk of changes in the net assets of certain of its foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to hedge the interest rate risk of certain long-term debt.\nAccounting Policy. \nDerivatives are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are classified as current or non-current according to their contractual maturities. Further information on our policies for determining fair value are discussed in Note 12. The Company applies hedge accounting when derivatives are designated, qualified and highly effective as hedges. Under hedge accounting, the changes in fair value of the derivative and the hedged risk are generally recognized together and offset each other when reported in Shareholders' net income. Various qualitative or quantitative methods appropriate for each hedge are used to formally assess and document hedge effectiveness at inception and each period throughout the life of a hedge. \nFair Value Hedges of the Foreign Exchange-Related Changes in Fair Values of Certain Foreign-Denominated Bonds\n:\nThis program hedges the foreign exchange-related changes in fair values of certain foreign-denominated bonds. The notional value of these derivatives matches the amortized cost of the hedged bonds. A majority of these instruments are denominated in Euros, with the remaining instruments denominated in British Pounds Sterling and Australian Dollars. Swap fair values are reported in Long-term investments or Other non-current liabilities. Offsetting changes in fair values attributable to the foreign exchange risk of the swap contracts and the hedged bonds are reported in Net investment losses. The portion of the swap contracts' changes in fair value excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in Other comprehensive loss and recognized in Net investment \n83\nincome as swap coupon payments are accrued, offsetting the foreign-denominated coupons received on the designated bonds. Net cash flows are reported in Operating activities, while exchanges of notional principal amounts are reported in Investing activities. \nFair Value Hedges of the Interest Rate Exposure on the Company's Long-Term Debt\n:\n \nThis program converts a portion of the interest rate exposure on the Company's long-term debt from fixed to variable rates. This more closely aligns the Company's interest expense with the interest income received on its cash equivalent and short-term investment balances. The variable rates are benchmarked to SOFR. Using fair value hedge accounting, the fair values of the swap contracts are reported in other assets or other liabilities. The critical terms of these swaps match those of the long-term debt being hedged. As a result, the carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted to reflect changes in its fair value driven by SOFR. The effects of those adjustments on interest expense are offset by the effects of corresponding changes in the swaps' fair value. The net impact from the hedge reported in Interest expense and other reflects interest expense on the hedged debt at the variable interest rate. Cash flows relating to these contracts are reported in Operating activities. \nNet Investment Hedges of Certain Foreign Subsidiaries Operating Principally in Currencies Other than the U.S. Dollar\n: \nThis program reduces the risk of changes in net assets due to changes in foreign currency spot exchange rates for certain foreign subsidiaries that conduct their business principally in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The notional value of hedging instruments matches the hedged amount of subsidiary net assets. Foreign currency swap contracts are denominated in Euros. The fair values of the foreign currency swap and forward contracts are reported in other assets or other liabilities. The changes in fair values of these instruments are reported in Other comprehensive loss, specifically in translation of foreign currencies. The portion of the change in fair values relating to foreign exchange spot rates will be recognized in earnings upon deconsolidation of the hedged foreign subsidiaries. Cash flows relating to these contracts are reported in Investing activities.\n \nThe effects of derivative financial instruments used in our individual hedging strategies were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The gross fair values of our derivative financial instruments are presented in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe following table summarizes the types and notional quantity of derivative instruments held by the Company: \nNotional Value as of\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nType of Instrument\nFair value hedge - Foreign currency swap contracts\n$\n975\n \n$\n1,026\n \nFair value hedge - Interest rate swap contracts\n$\n2,700\n \n$\n1,500\n \nNet investment hedge - Foreign currency swap contracts \n$\n415\n \n$\n415\n \nC.\nNet Investment Income\nAccounting Policy.\n When interest and principal payments on investments are current, the Company recognizes interest income when it is earned. The Company recognizes interest income on a cash basis when interest payments are delinquent based on contractual terms or when certain terms (interest rate or maturity date) of the investment have been restructured. For unconsolidated entities that are included in other long-term investments, investment income is generally recognized according to the Company's share of the reported income or loss on the underlying investments. Investment income attributed to the Company's separate accounts is excluded from our earnings because associated gains and losses generally accrue directly to separate account policyholders.\nThe components of Net investment income were as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDebt securities\n$\n492\n \n$\n500\n \n$\n572\n \nEquity securities \n(1)\n(\n114\n)\n123\n \n14\n \nCommercial mortgage loans\n61\n \n65\n \n59\n \nPolicy loans\n56\n \n60\n \n59\n \nOther long-term investments\n75\n \n123\n \n390\n \nShort-term investments and cash\n447\n \n339\n \n115\n \nTotal investment income\n1,017\n \n1,210\n \n1,209\n \nLess investment expenses\n44\n \n44\n \n54\n \nNet investment income\n$\n973\n \n$\n1,166\n \n$\n1,155\n \n(1)\nIncludes a $\n182\n million impairment of dividend receivable for the year ended December 31, 2024. See the Equity Securities section of Note 11A to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n84\nD.\nInvestment Gains and Losses\nAccounting Policy. \nInvestment gains and losses are based on specifically identified assets and result from sales, investment asset write-downs, changes in the fair value of certain derivatives and equity securities and changes in allowances for credit losses on debt securities and commercial mortgage loan investments.\nNet investment losses before income taxes were $\n2,737\n million, $\n78\n million and $\n487\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by the impairment of equity securities in 2024. These amounts exclude investment gains and losses attributed to the Company's separate accounts because those gains and losses generally accrue directly to separate account policyholders.\n \nNote 12 – Fair Value Measurements \nAccounting Policy. \nThe Company carries certain financial instruments at fair value in the financial statements including debt securities, certain equity securities, short-term investments and derivatives. Other financial instruments are measured at fair value only under certain conditions, such as when impaired or when there are observable price changes for equity securities with no readily determinable fair value.\nFair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a market participant, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.\nThe Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value have been classified based upon a hierarchy defined by GAAP. The hierarchy gives the highest ranking to fair values determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest ranking to fair values determined using methodologies and models with unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset's or a liability's classification is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its measurement. For example, a financial asset or liability carried at fair value would be classified in Level 3 if unobservable inputs were significant to the instrument's fair value, even though the measurement may be derived using inputs that are both observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3).\nThe Company estimates fair values using prices from third parties or internal pricing methods. Fair value estimates received from third-party pricing services are based on reported trade activity and quoted market prices when available and other market information that a market participant would use to estimate fair value. The internal pricing methods are performed by the Company's investment professionals and generally involve using discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating current market inputs for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality as well as other qualitative factors. In instances where there is little or no market activity for the same or similar instruments, fair value is estimated using methods, models and assumptions that the Company believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price. These valuation techniques involve some level of estimation and judgment that becomes significant with increasingly complex instruments or pricing models.\nThe Company is responsible for determining fair value and for assigning the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable inputs. The Company reviews methodologies, processes and controls of third-party pricing services and compares prices on a test basis to those obtained from other external pricing sources or internal estimates. The Company performs ongoing analyses of both prices received from third-party pricing services and those developed internally to determine that they represent appropriate estimates of fair value. The controls executed by the Company include evaluating changes in prices and monitoring for potentially stale valuations. The Company also performs sample testing of sales values to confirm the accuracy of prior fair value estimates. The minimal exceptions identified during these processes indicate that adjustments to prices are infrequent and do not significantly impact valuations. An annual due diligence review of the most significant pricing service is conducted to review their processes, methodologies and controls. This review includes a walk-through of inputs for a sample of securities held across various asset types to validate the documented pricing process.\n85\nA.\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Fair Value\nThe following table provides information about the Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value. Further information regarding insurance assets and liabilities carried at fair value is provided in Note 9E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Separate account assets are also recorded at fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reported separately in the Separate Accounts section below as gains and losses related to these assets generally accrue directly to contractholders.\n(In millions)\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\n(Level 3)\nTotal\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nFinancial assets at fair value\nDebt securities\nFederal government and agency\n$\n165\n \n$\n130\n \n$\n116\n \n$\n137\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n281\n \n$\n267\n \nState and local government\n—\n \n—\n \n37\n \n38\n \n—\n \n—\n \n37\n \n38\n \nForeign government\n—\n \n—\n \n344\n \n352\n \n—\n \n—\n \n344\n \n352\n \nCorporate\n—\n \n—\n \n8,049\n \n8,432\n \n374\n \n401\n \n8,423\n \n8,833\n \nMortgage and other asset-backed\n—\n \n—\n \n295\n \n319\n \n43\n \n46\n \n338\n \n365\n \nTotal debt securities\n165\n \n130\n \n8,841\n \n9,278\n \n417\n \n447\n \n9,423\n \n9,855\n \nEquity securities \n(1)\n1\n \n4\n \n36\n \n47\n \n—\n \n—\n \n37\n \n51\n \nShort-term investments\n—\n \n—\n \n170\n \n206\n \n—\n \n—\n \n170\n \n206\n \nDerivative assets\n—\n \n—\n \n168\n \n131\n \n—\n \n1\n \n168\n \n132\n \nFinancial liabilities at fair value\nDerivative liabilities\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n4\n \n(1)\nExcludes certain equity securities that have no readily determinable fair value.\nLevel 1 Financial Assets\nInputs for instruments classified in Level 1 include unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets accessible at the measurement date. Active markets provide pricing data for trades occurring at least weekly and include exchanges and dealer markets.\nAssets in Level 1 include actively traded U.S. government bonds and exchange-listed equity securities. A relatively small portion of the Company's investment assets are classified in this category given the narrow definition of Level 1 and the Company's investment asset strategy to maximize investment returns.\nLevel 2 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nInputs for instruments classified in Level 2 include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices from those willing to trade in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are market-observable or can be corroborated by market data for the term of the instrument. Such other inputs include market interest rates and volatilities, spreads, and yield curves. An instrument is classified in Level 2 if the Company determines that unobservable inputs are insignificant.\nDebt and Equity Securities\n. Third-party pricing services and internal methods often use recent trades of securities with similar features and characteristics because many debt securities do not trade daily. Pricing models are used to determine these prices when recent trades are not available. These models calculate fair values by discounting future cash flows at estimated market interest rates. Such market rates are derived by calculating the appropriate spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury securities based on the credit quality, industry and structure of the asset. Typical inputs and assumptions to pricing models include, but are not limited to, a combination of benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, liquidity, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. For mortgage-backed securities, inputs and assumptions may also include characteristics of the issuer, collateral attributes, prepayment speeds and credit rating. Nearly all of these instruments are valued using recent trades or pricing models. \nShort-term Investments\n are carried at fair value that approximates cost. The Company compares market prices for these securities to recorded amounts on a regular basis to validate that current carrying amounts approximate exit prices. The short-term nature of the investments and corroboration of the reported amounts over the holding period support their classification in Level 2.\n86\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\n classified in Level 2 represent over-the-counter instruments, such as foreign currency forward and swap contracts. Fair values for these instruments are determined using market-observable inputs, including forward currency and interest rate curves and widely published market-observable indices. Credit risk related to the counterparty and the Company is considered when estimating the fair values of these derivatives. The nature and use of these derivative financial instruments are described in Note 11.\nLevel 3 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nCertain inputs for instruments classified in Level 3 are unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) and significant to their resulting fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company's best estimate of what hypothetical market participants would use to determine a transaction price for the asset or liability at the reporting date. Additionally, as discussed in Note 9E to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company classifies variable annuity assets and liabilities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company classifies certain newly issued, privately placed, complex or illiquid securities in Level 3. Approximately \n5\n% of debt securities are priced using significant unobservable inputs and classified in this category.\nFair values of mortgage and other asset-backed securities, as well as corporate and government debt securities, are primarily determined using pricing models that incorporate the specific characteristics of each asset and related assumptions, including the investment type and structure, credit quality, industry and maturity date in comparison to current market indices, spreads, and liquidity of assets with similar characteristics. Inputs and assumptions for pricing may also include characteristics of the issuer, collateral attributes, and prepayment speeds for mortgage and other asset-backed securities. Recent trades in the subject security or similar securities are assessed when available, and the Company may also review published research in its evaluation, as well as the issuer's financial statements.\nQuantitative Information about Unobservable Inputs\nThe significant unobservable input used to value our corporate and government debt securities and mortgage and other asset-backed securities is an adjustment for liquidity. This adjustment is needed to reflect current market conditions and issuer circumstances when there is limited trading activity for the security.\n \nThe following table summarizes the fair value and significant unobservable inputs that were developed directly by the Company and used in pricing these debt securities. The range and weighted average basis point amounts for liquidity reflect the Company's best estimates of the unobservable adjustments a market participant would make to calculate these fair values. An increase in liquidity spread adjustments would result in a lower fair value measurement, while a decrease would result in a higher fair value measurement.\nFair Value as of\nUnobservable Adjustment Range (Weighted Average by Quantity) as of\n(Fair value in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nUnobservable Input December 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDebt securities\nCorporate\n$\n373\n \n$\n401\n \nLiquidity\n60\n - \n1520\n (\n370\n)\nbps\n70\n - \n1235\n (\n310\n)\nbps\nMortgage and other asset-backed securities\n43\n \n46\n \nLiquidity\n100\n - \n550\n (\n280\n) \nbps\n95\n - \n640\n (\n310\n)\nbps\nOther debt securities\n1\n \n—\n \nTotal Level 3 debt securities\n$\n417\n \n$\n447\n \n87\nChanges in Level 3 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Fair Value\nThe following table summarizes the changes in financial assets and financial liabilities classified in Level 3.

Gains and losses included in Other comprehensive loss, net of tax in the tables above are reflected in Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on securities and derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nTransfers into or out of the Level 3 category occur when unobservable inputs, such as the Company's best estimate of what a market participant would use to determine a current transaction price, become more or less significant to the fair value measurement. Market activity typically decreases during periods of economic uncertainty, and this decrease in activity reduces the availability of market observable data. As a result, the level of unobservable judgment that must be applied to the pricing of certain instruments increases and is typically observed through the widening of liquidity spreads.\n Transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 during 2024 and 2023 primarily reflected changes in liquidity estimates for certain private placement issuers across several sectors. See discussion under Quantitative Information about Unobservable Inputs above for more information.\nSeparate Accounts\nAccounting Policy. \nSeparate account assets and liabilities are contractholder funds maintained in accounts with specific investment objectives. Our subsidiaries or external advisors manage invested assets of separate accounts on behalf of contractholders, including The Cigna Group Pension Plan, variable universal life products sold through our corporate-owned life insurance products and the run-off businesses. The assets of these accounts are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any of the Company's other businesses. These separate account assets are carried at fair value with equal amounts recorded for related separate account liabilities. The investment income and fair value gains and losses of separate account assets generally accrue directly to the contractholders and, together with their deposits and withdrawals, are excluded from the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows. Fees and charges earned for mortality risks, asset management or administrative services are reported in either Premiums or Fees and other revenues. Investments that are measured using the practical expedient of net asset value (\"NAV\") are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The separate account activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was primarily driven by changes in the market values of the underlying separate account investments.\n88\nFair values of Separate account assets were as follows:\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\n(Level 3)\nTotal\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nGuaranteed separate accounts (See Note 21)\n$\n231\n \n$\n226\n \n$\n345\n \n$\n352\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n576\n \n$\n578\n \nNon-guaranteed separate accounts\n (1)\n267\n \n158\n \n5,575\n \n5,797\n \n228\n \n217\n \n6,070\n \n6,172\n \nSubtotal\n$\n498\n \n$\n384\n \n$\n5,920\n \n$\n6,149\n \n$\n228\n \n$\n217\n \n6,646\n \n6,750\n \nNon-guaranteed separate accounts priced at NAV as a practical expedient \n(1)\n632\n \n680\n \nTotal\n$\n7,278\n \n$\n7,430\n \n(1)\nNon-guaranteed separate accounts include $\n3.8\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n4.0\n billion\n \nas of December 31, 2023 in assets supporting the Company's pension plans, including $\n0.2\n billion classified in Level 3 both as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Non-guaranteed separate accounts are primarily comprised of securities partnerships, real estate and real estate funds.\nSeparate account assets classified as Level 1 primarily include exchange-listed equity securities. Level 2 assets primarily include corporate and structured bonds valued using recent trades of similar securities or pricing models that discount future cash flows at estimated market interest rates as described above, and actively traded institutional and retail mutual fund investments.\nSeparate account assets classified in Level 3 primarily support the Company's pension plans and include certain newly issued, privately placed, complex or illiquid securities that are priced using methods discussed above, as well as commercial mortgage loans.\n Activity, including transfers into and out of Level 3, was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023. \nB.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value under Certain Conditions\nSome financial assets and liabilities are not carried at fair value, such as commercial mortgage loans that are carried at unpaid principal, investment real estate that is carried at depreciated cost and equity securities with no readily determinable fair value when there are no observable market transactions. However, these financial assets and liabilities may be measured using fair value under certain conditions, such as when investments become impaired and are written down to their fair value, or when there are observable price changes from orderly market transactions of equity securities that otherwise had no readily determinable fair value.\nDuring 2024, we determined our investment in VillageMD was fully impaired and recorded a $\n2.7\n billion loss in Net investment losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2023, impairments recognized requiring the assets and liabilities described above to be measured at fair value were not material. Observable price changes for equity securities with no readily determinable fair value were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nC.\nFair Value Disclosures for Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value\nThe following table includes the Company's financial instruments not recorded at fair value but for which fair value disclosure is required. In addition to universal life products and finance leases, financial instruments that are carried in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts that approximate fair value are excluded from the following table.\nClassification in Fair Value Hierarchy\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions)\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nCommercial mortgage loans\nLevel 3\n$\n1,256\n \n$\n1,351\n \n$\n1,430\n \n$\n1,533\n \nLong-term debt, including current maturities, excluding finance leases\nLevel 2\n$\n28,392\n \n$\n31,008\n \n$\n28,033\n \n$\n29,585\n \nNote 13 – Variable Interest Entities \nWhen the Company becomes involved with a variable interest entity and when there is a change in the Company's involvement with an entity, the Company must determine if it is the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the entity. The Company is considered the primary beneficiary if it has the power to direct the entity's most significant economic activities and has the right to receive benefits or obligation to absorb losses that could be significant to the entity. \n89\nThe Company evaluates the following criteria: the structure and purpose of the entity; the risks and rewards created by and shared through the entity; and the Company's ability to direct its activities, receive its benefits and absorb its losses relative to the other parties involved with the entity, including its sponsors, equity holders, guarantors, creditors and servicers. \nThe Company determined it was \nno\nt a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. The Company's involvement in variable interest entities for which it is not the primary beneficiary is described below.\nSecurities Limited Partnerships and Real Estate Limited Partnerships\n. The Company owns interests in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships that are defined as unconsolidated variable interest entities. These partnerships invest in the equity or mezzanine debt of privately held companies and real estate properties. General partners unaffiliated with the Company control decisions that most significantly impact the partnership's operations, and the limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights. The Company has invested in approximately \n195\n limited partnerships that have a carrying value of $\n3.2\n billion as of December 31, 2024 reported in other long-term investments.\n As of December 31, 2024, we have commitments to contribute an additional $\n2.4\n billion to these entities, and the Company's maximum exposure to loss from these investments is $\n5.6\n billion, calculated as the sum of our carrying value and the additional funding commitments. Our noncontrolling interest in each of these limited partnerships is generally less than \n10\n% of the partnership ownership interests. See Note 11 for further information on the Company's accounting policy for other long-term investments. \nThe Company has guaranteed debt payments to mortgage lenders for certain real estate limited partnerships should potential environmental obligations arise. \nNo\n liability has been incurred related to these guarantees, and the Company's maximum exposure to these guarantees was approximately $\n272\n million as of December 31, 2024.\nOther Variable Interest Entities\n. The Company is involved in other types of variable interest entities, including certain asset-backed and corporate securities, real estate joint ventures that develop properties for residential and commercial use, independent physician associations that provide care management services, and international health care joint ventures. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's maximum exposure to loss is $\n0.4\n billion from certain asset-backed and corporate securities and $\n0.9\n billion from real estate joint ventures, which represents the sum of our carrying value and the additional funding commitments for these entities. The carrying values and maximum exposures for the remaining unconsolidated variable interest entities were not material as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company has not provided, and does not intend to provide, financial support to any of the variable interest entities in excess of its maximum exposure.\n We perform ongoing qualitative analyses of our involvement with these variable interest entities to determine if consolidation is required.\n90\nNote 14 – Collectively Significant Operating Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nIn addition to equity method investments in certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies holding real estate, securities or loans (as disclosed in Note 11), we maintain a portfolio of operating joint ventures accounted for as equity method investments. Operating joint ventures had a carrying value of $\n656\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n911\n million as of December 31, 2023, of which $\n43\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n214\n million as of December 31, 2023 related to our joint venture in China. Total Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (\"AOCI\") includes losses of $\n979\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n510\n million as of December 31, 2023 related to the Company's share of operating joint ventures primarily driven by the requirement to update discount rate assumptions for certain long-duration liabilities.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, none of our equity method investments were individually significant. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we sold a portion of an operating joint venture, reducing our ownership. As a result, we recognized $\n496\n million\n within Net gain (loss) on sale of businesses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. \nAccounting Policy. \nWe record in our Consolidated Statements of Income our proportionate share of net income or loss generated by operating joint ventures within Fees and other revenues. In certain instances, income or loss is reported on a one-month lag due to the timing of when financial information is received.\nThe below summarized results of operations and financial position of the operating joint ventures reflects the latest available financial information and does not represent the Company's proportionate share of the assets, liabilities or earnings of such entities.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$\n7,309\n \n$\n5,962\n \n$\n4,665\n \nNet income (loss)\n$\n607\n \n$\n98\n \n$\n(\n12\n)\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal assets\n$\n34,395\n \n$\n26,681\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n33,892\n \n$\n25,534\n \nNote 15 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) includes net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on securities and derivatives, change in discount rate and instrument-specific credit risk for certain long-duration insurance contractholder liabilities (Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), foreign currency translation, and the net postretirement benefits liability adjustment. AOCI includes the Company's share from unconsolidated entities reported on the equity method. \nGenerally, tax effects in AOCI are established at the currently enacted tax rate and reclassified to Shareholders' net income in the same period that the related pre-tax AOCI reclassifications are recognized.\nShareholders' other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for the years ended 2024, 2023 and 2022 is primarily attributable to the change in discount rates for certain long-duration liabilities and unrealized changes in the market values of securities and derivatives, including the impacts from unconsolidated entities reported on the equity method. \n91\nChanges in the components of AOCI were as follows: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSecurities and Derivatives\nBeginning balance\n$\n171\n \n$\n(\n332\n)\n$\n1,266\n \nUnrealized appreciation (depreciation) on securities and derivatives, before reclassification, net of tax (expense) benefit of $(\n207\n), $(\n146\n) and $\n467\n, respectively\n601\n \n474\n \n(\n1,807\n)\nAmounts reclassified to Shareholders' net income, net of tax (benefit) of $(\n16\n), $(\n8\n) and $(\n48\n), respectively\n60\n \n29\n \n209\n \nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\n661\n \n503\n \n(\n1,598\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n832\n \n$\n171\n \n$\n(\n332\n)\nNet long-duration insurance and contractholder liabilities measurement adjustments\nBeginning balance\n$\n(\n971\n)\n$\n(\n256\n)\n$\n(\n765\n)\nNet current period change in discount rate for certain long-duration liabilities, net of tax benefit (expense) of $\n357\n, $\n222\n and $(\n122\n), respectively\n(\n1,044\n)\n(\n691\n)\n520\n \nNet current period change in instrument-specific credit risk for market risk benefits, net of tax benefit of $\n6\n, $\n5\n and $\n3\n, respectively\n(\n23\n)\n(\n24\n)\n(\n11\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax\n(\n1,067\n)\n(\n715\n)\n509\n \nEnding balance\n$\n(\n2,038\n)\n$\n(\n971\n)\n$\n(\n256\n)\nTranslation of foreign currencies\nBeginning balance\n$\n(\n149\n)\n$\n(\n154\n)\n$\n(\n233\n)\nNet translation of foreign currencies, before reclassification, net of tax benefit (expense) of $\n2\n, $\n5\n and $(\n33\n), respectively\n(\n60\n)\n5\n \n(\n310\n)\nAmounts reclassified to Shareholders' net income, net of tax expense of $\n—\n, $\n—\n and $\n29\n, respectively\n11\n \n—\n \n387\n \nOther comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax\n(\n49\n)\n5\n \n77\n \nLess: Net translation (loss) on foreign currencies attributable to noncontrolling interests\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\nShareholders' other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax\n(\n49\n)\n5\n \n79\n \nEnding balance\n$\n(\n198\n)\n$\n(\n149\n)\n$\n(\n154\n)\nPostretirement benefits liability\nBeginning balance\n$\n(\n915\n)\n$\n(\n916\n)\n$\n(\n1,336\n)\nAmounts reclassified to Shareholders' net income, net of tax (benefit) of $(\n7\n), $(\n11\n) and $(\n16\n), respectively\n22\n \n35\n \n48\n \nNet change due to valuation update, before reclassification, net of tax benefit (expense) of $\n14\n, $\n12\n and $(\n115\n), respectively\n(\n44\n)\n(\n34\n)\n372\n \nOther comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax\n(\n22\n)\n1\n \n420\n \nEnding balance\n$\n(\n937\n)\n$\n(\n915\n)\n$\n(\n916\n)\nTotal Accumulated other comprehensive loss\nBeginning balance\n$\n(\n1,864\n)\n$\n(\n1,658\n)\n$\n(\n1,068\n)\nShareholders' other comprehensive (loss), net of tax benefit of $\n149\n, $\n79\n and $\n165\n, respectively\n(\n477\n)\n(\n206\n)\n(\n590\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n(\n2,341\n)\n$\n(\n1,864\n)\n$\n(\n1,658\n)\nNote 16 – Pension\nA.\nAbout Our Plans\nThe Company sponsors U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans; future benefit accruals for the domestic plans are frozen.\nAccounting Policy.\n The Company measures the assets and liabilities of its domestic pension plans as of December 31. Benefit obligations are measured at the present value of estimated future payments based on actuarial assumptions. The Company uses the corridor method to account for changes in the benefit obligation when actual results differ from those assumed or when assumptions change. These changes are called net unrecognized actuarial gains (losses). Under the corridor method, net unrecognized actuarial gains (losses) are initially recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. When the unrecognized gain (loss) exceeds 10% of the benefit obligation, that excess is amortized to expense over the expected remaining lives of plan participants. The net plan expense is reported in Interest expense and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe measure plan assets at fair value for balance sheet purposes and to measure pension benefit costs. When the actual return differs from the expected return, those differences are reflected in the net unrealized actuarial gain (loss) discussed above.\n92\nB.\nFunded Status and Amounts Included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table summarizes the projected benefit obligations and assets related to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nChange in benefit obligation\nBenefit obligation, January 1\n$\n3,934\n \n$\n3,948\n \nService cost\n1\n \n1\n \nInterest cost\n194\n \n204\n \nActuarial (gains) losses, net \n(1)\n(\n146\n)\n93\n \nBenefits paid from plan assets\n(\n328\n)\n(\n294\n)\nOther\n(\n12\n)\n(\n18\n)\nBenefit obligation, December 31\n3,643\n \n3,934\n \nChange in plan assets\nFair value of plan assets, January 1\n4,138\n \n4,186\n \nActual return on plan assets\n40\n \n246\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n328\n)\n(\n294\n)\nContributions\n4\n \n—\n \nFair value of plan assets, December 31\n3,854\n \n4,138\n \nFunded status\n$\n211\n \n$\n204\n \nAmounts presented in Consolidated Balance Sheets\nOther assets\n$\n211\n \n$\n204\n \n(1)\n 2024 gains reflect an increase in the discount rate, while 2023 losses reflect a decrease in the discount rate.\nWe fund our qualified pension plans at least at the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Company made immaterial contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2024. For 2025, contributions to the qualified pension plans are expected to be immaterial. Future years' contributions will ultimately be based on a wide range of factors, including but not limited to asset returns, discount rates and funding targets. Nonqualified pension plans are generally funded on a pay-as-you-go basis as there are \nno\n plan assets for these plans.\nBenefit Payments.\n \nThe following benefit payments are expected to be paid in:\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n315\n \n2026\n$\n314\n \n2027\n$\n311\n \n2028\n$\n309\n \n2029\n$\n306\n \n2030 - 2034\n$\n1,443\n \nAmounts reflected in the pension assets (liabilities) shown above that have not yet been reported in Net income and, therefore, have been included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nUnrecognized net (losses)\n$\n(\n1,228\n)\n$\n(\n1,207\n)\nUnrecognized prior service cost\n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\nPostretirement benefits liability adjustment\n$\n(\n1,232\n)\n$\n(\n1,211\n)\n93\nC.\nCost of Our Plans\nNet pension cost was as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nService cost\n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2\n \nInterest cost\n194\n \n204\n \n140\n \nExpected long-term return on plan assets\n(\n247\n)\n(\n204\n)\n(\n272\n)\nAmortization of:\nPrior actuarial losses, net\n39\n \n52\n \n89\n \nCurtailment loss\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \nNet (benefit) cost\n$\n(\n12\n)\n$\n53\n \n$\n(\n41\n)\nD.\nAssumptions Used for Pension\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nDiscount rate:\nPension benefit obligation\n5.57\n%\n5.10\n%\nPension benefit cost\n5.10\n%\n5.43\n%\nExpected long-term return on plan assets:\nPension benefit cost\n6.50\n%\n6.50\n%\nMortality table for pension obligations\nWhite Collar mortality table with MP 2021 projection scale\nWhite Collar mortality table with MP 2021 projection scale\nThe Company develops discount rates by applying actual annualized yields for high-quality bonds by duration to the expected pension plan liability cash flows. The bond yields represent a diverse mix of actively traded high-quality fixed income securities that have an above-average return at each duration as management believes this approach is representative of the yield achieved through plan asset investment strategy. The expected long-term return on plan assets was developed considering historical long-term actual returns, expected long-term market conditions, plan asset mix and management's plan asset investment strategy.\nE.\nPension Plan Assets\nAs of December 31, 2024, pension assets included $\n3.8\n billion invested in the separate accounts of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, and an additional $\n0.1\n billion invested in funds of unaffiliated investment managers. \nThe fair values of pension assets by category are as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDebt securities:\nFederal government and agency\n$\n99\n \n$\n12\n \nCorporate\n2,673\n \n2,780\n \nAsset-backed\n138\n \n121\n \nFund investments\n76\n \n278\n \nTotal debt securities\n2,986\n \n3,191\n \nEquity securities:\nDomestic\n21\n \n27\n \nInternational, including funds and pooled separate accounts\n (1)\n6\n \n6\n \nTotal equity securities\n27\n \n33\n \nSecurities partnerships, including pooled separate accounts\n (1)\n402\n \n419\n \nReal estate and real estate funds, including pooled separate accounts\n (1)\n228\n \n270\n \nCommercial mortgage loans\n27\n \n46\n \nGuaranteed deposit account contract\n47\n \n48\n \nCash equivalents and other current assets, net\n137\n \n131\n \nTotal pension assets at fair value\n$\n3,854\n \n$\n4,138\n \n(1)\n A pooled separate account has several participating benefit plans and each owns a share of the total pool of investments.\n94\nThe Company's current target investment allocation percentages are \n90\n% fixed income and \n10\n% in other investments, including private equity (securities partnerships), public equity securities, and real estate, and are developed by management as guidelines, although the fair values of each asset category are expected to vary as a result of changes in market conditions. The Company will evaluate further allocation changes to equity securities, other investments and fixed income securities as funding levels change.\nSee Note 12 for further details regarding how fair value is determined, including the level within the fair value hierarchy and the procedures we use to validate fair value measurements. The Company classifies substantially all debt securities in Level 2 for pension plan assets. These assets are valued using recent trades of similar securities or are fund investments priced using their daily net asset value that is the exit price. All domestic equity securities and international equity funds within pension assets are classified as Level 3.\nSecurities partnerships, real estate and hedge funds are valued using net asset value as a practical expedient and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. See Note 12 for additional disclosures related to these assets invested in the separate accounts of the Company's subsidiary. Certain securities as described in Note 12, as well as commercial mortgage loans and guaranteed deposit account contracts, are classified in Level 3 because unobservable inputs used in their valuation are significant.\nF.\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) plan. All employees are immediately eligible for the plan at hire. The Company matches a portion of employees' contributions to the plan and may increase its matching contributions if the Company's annual performance meets certain targets. Plan participants may invest in various funds that invest in the Company's common stock, several diversified stock funds, a bond fund or stable value funds. The Company common stock fund under the plan constitutes an \"employee stock ownership plan\" as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends from the Company common stock fund are reinvested in a participant's stock fund account unless the participant elects to receive the dividends in cash. The Company's annual expense for the plan was $\n301\n million, $\n296\n million and $\n274\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNote 17 – Employee Incentive Plans\nA.\nAbout Our Plans\nThe People Resources Committee (the \"Committee\") of the Board of Directors awards stock options, restricted stock grants, restricted stock units, deferred stock and strategic performance shares to certain employees. The Company issues original issue shares for these awards.\nThe Company records compensation expense for stock and option awards over their vesting periods primarily based on the estimated fair value at the grant date. Fair value is determined differently for each type of award as discussed below.\nShares of common stock available for award were as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nCommon shares available for award\n12.4\n \n14.4\n \n16.6\n \nB.\nStock Options\nAccounting Policy.\n The Company awards options to purchase The Cigna Group common stock at the market price of the stock on the grant date. Options vest over periods ranging from \none year\n to \nthree years\n and expire no later than \n10\n years from grant date. Fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model by applying the assumptions presented below. That fair value is reduced by options expected to be forfeited during the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures at the grant date based on our experience and adjusts the expense to reflect actual forfeitures over the vesting period. The fair value of options, net of forfeitures, is recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n95\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model assumptions and the resulting fair value of options are presented in the following table: \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nDividend yield\n1.74\n \n%\n1.58\n \n%\n1.98\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n30.0\n \n%\n30.0\n \n%\n30.0\n \n%\nRisk free interest rate\n4.0\n \n%\n3.6\n \n%\n1.6\n \n%\nExpected option life\n4.8\n years\n4.7\n years\n4.5\n years\nWeighted average fair value of options\n$\n92.36\n \n$\n79.66\n \n$\n50.61\n \nThe dividend yield reflects expected future dividends. The Company intends to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. The expected volatility reflects the past daily stock price volatility of The Cigna Group stock. The Company does not consider volatility implied in the market prices of traded options to be a good indicator of future volatility because remaining traded options will expire within \none year\n. The risk free interest rate is derived using the four-year U.S. Treasury bond yield rate as of the award date for the primary annual grant. Expected option life reflects the Company's historical experience.\nThe following table shows the status of, and changes in, common stock options:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Options in thousands)\nOptions\nWeighted Average Exercise Price\nOptions\nWeighted Average Exercise Price\nOptions\nWeighted Average Exercise Price\nOutstanding - January 1\n6,696\n \n$\n202.02\n \n6,992\n \n$\n186.54\n \n8,490\n \n$\n169.47\n \nGranted\n781\n \n$\n336.48\n \n915\n \n$\n294.37\n \n1,375\n \n$\n226.95\n \nExercised\n(\n1,727\n)\n$\n178.82\n \n(\n1,080\n)\n$\n174.66\n \n(\n2,617\n)\n$\n149.97\n \nExpired or canceled\n(\n95\n)\n$\n278.78\n \n(\n131\n)\n$\n246.95\n \n(\n256\n)\n$\n211.22\n \nOutstanding - December 31\n5,655\n \n$\n226.38\n \n6,696\n \n$\n202.02\n \n6,992\n \n$\n186.54\n \nOptions exercisable at year-end\n3,941\n \n$\n196.01\n \n4,616\n \n$\n179.28\n \n4,410\n \n$\n168.97\n \nCompensation expense of $\n69\n million related to unvested stock options at December 31, 2024 will be recognized over the next \ntwo years\n (weighted average period).\nThe table below summarizes information for stock options exercised:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIntrinsic value of options exercised\n$\n275\n \n$\n126\n \n$\n313\n \nCash received for options exercised\n$\n305\n \n$\n187\n \n$\n389\n \nTax benefit from options exercised\n$\n34\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n47\n \nThe following table summarizes information for outstanding common stock options:\nDecember 31, 2024\n \nOptions\nOutstanding\nOptions\nExercisable\nNumber (in thousands)\n5,655\n \n3,941\n \nTotal intrinsic value (in millions)\n$\n341\n \n$\n320\n \nWeighted average exercise price\n$\n226.38\n \n$\n196.01\n \nWeighted average remaining contractual life\n5.8\n years\n4.7\n years\nC.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company awards restricted stock (grants and units) to the Company's employees that vest over periods ranging from \none year\n to \nthree years\n. Recipients of restricted stock awards accumulate dividends during the vesting period, but generally forfeit their awards and accumulated dividends if their employment terminates before the vesting date.\nAccounting Policy.\n Fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the market price of The Cigna Group common stock on the date of grant. This fair value is reduced by awards that are expected to forfeit. At the grant date, the Company estimates forfeitures based on experience and adjusts the expense to reflect actual forfeitures over the vesting period. This fair value, net of forfeitures, is recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\n96\nThe following table shows the status of, and changes in, restricted stock awards:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Awards in thousands)\nGrants/Units\nWeighted Average Fair Value at Award Date\nGrants/Units\nWeighted Average Fair Value at Award Date\nGrants/Units\nWeighted Average Fair Value at Award Date\nOutstanding - January 1\n1,404\n \n$\n257.38\n \n1,535\n \n$\n219.25\n \n1,524\n \n$\n202.85\n \nAwarded\n624\n \n$\n319.39\n \n700\n \n$\n294.60\n \n876\n \n$\n229.60\n \nVested\n(\n713\n)\n$\n245.35\n \n(\n759\n)\n$\n214.70\n \n(\n714\n)\n$\n197.83\n \nForfeited\n(\n65\n)\n$\n283.62\n \n(\n72\n)\n$\n256.24\n \n(\n151\n)\n$\n215.02\n \nOutstanding - December 31\n1,250\n \n$\n302.42\n \n1,404\n \n$\n257.38\n \n1,535\n \n$\n219.25\n \nThe fair value of vested restricted stock at the vesting date was as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFair value of vested restricted stock\n$\n238\n \n$\n220\n \n$\n167\n \nApproximately \n8,900\n employees held \n1.3\n million restricted stock awards at the end of 2024 with $\n203\n million of related compensation expense to be recognized over the next \ntwo years\n (weighted average period).\nD.\nStrategic Performance Shares (\"SPSs\")\nThe Company awards SPSs to executives and certain other key employees generally with a performance period of \nthree years\n. Half of these shares are subject to a market condition (total shareholder return relative to industry peer companies), and half are subject to a performance condition (cumulative adjusted net income). These targets are set by the Committee at the beginning of the performance period. Holders of these awards receive shares of The Cigna Group common stock at the end of the performance period ranging anywhere from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the original awards.\nAccounting Policy.\n Compensation expense for SPSs is recorded over the performance period. Fair value is determined at the grant date for \"market condition\" SPSs using a Monte Carlo simulation model and not subsequently adjusted regardless of the final outcome. Expense is initially accrued for \"performance condition\" SPSs based on the most likely outcome, but evaluated for adjustment each period for updates in the expected outcome. Expense is adjusted to the actual outcome (number of shares awarded multiplied by the share price at the grant date) at the end of the performance period.\nThe following table shows the status of, and changes in, SPSs:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Awards in thousands)\nShares\nWeighted Average Fair Value at Award Date\nShares\nWeighted Average Fair Value at Award Date\nShares\nWeighted Average Fair Value at Award Date\nOutstanding - January 1\n686\n \n$\n243.90\n \n780\n \n$\n212.68\n \n860\n \n$\n197.07\n \nAwarded\n195\n \n$\n336.81\n \n219\n \n$\n293.85\n \n294\n \n$\n230.69\n \nVested\n(\n242\n)\n$\n214.93\n \n(\n250\n)\n$\n191.78\n \n(\n261\n)\n$\n183.60\n \nForfeited\n(\n38\n)\n$\n289.35\n \n(\n63\n)\n$\n237.50\n \n(\n113\n)\n$\n207.75\n \nOutstanding - December 31\n601\n \n$\n282.83\n \n686\n \n$\n243.90\n \n780\n \n$\n212.68\n \nThe weighted average fair value per share of SPSs for expense purposes, including the Monte Carlo factor, at the award date for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n377.23\n, $\n329.11\n and $\n258.37\n, respectively.\nThe fair value of vested SPSs at the vesting date was as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Shares in thousands; $ in millions)\nShares\nFair Value\nShares\nFair Value\nShares\nFair Value\nShares of The Cigna Group common stock distributed upon SPS vesting\n257\n \n$\n86\n \n257\n \n$\n76\n \n137\n \n$\n31\n \n97\nApproximately \n600\n employees held \n601,000\n SPSs at the end of 2024, and $\n64\n million of related compensation expense is expected to be recognized over the next \ntwo years\n. The amount of expense for \"performance condition\" SPSs will vary based on actual performance in 2025 and 2026.\nE.\nCompensation Cost and Tax Effects of Share-Based Compensation\nThe Company records tax benefits in Shareholders' net income during the vesting period based on the amount of expense being recognized. The difference between tax benefits based on the expense and the actual tax benefit realized are also recorded in income tax expense when stock options are exercised, or when restricted stock and SPSs vest.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal compensation cost for shared-based awards\n$\n308\n \n$\n286\n \n$\n264\n \nTax benefits recognized\n$\n94\n \n$\n92\n \n$\n80\n \nNote 18 – Goodwill, Other Intangibles, and Property and Equipment\nA.\nGoodwill\nAccounting Policy.\n Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of their net assets. The resulting goodwill is assigned to those reporting units expected to realize cash flows from the acquisition, based on those reporting units' relative fair values. The Company's reporting units are aligned with its operating segments as described in Note 1.\nThe Company conducts its annual quantitative evaluation for goodwill impairment during the third quarter at the reporting unit level and writes it down through Shareholders' net income if impaired. On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a qualitative impairment assessment to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is generally estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis and market approach models using assumptions that the Company believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price. Following a change in reporting units or held for sale determination, goodwill is allocated using relative fair value. The significant assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value primarily include the discount rate and future cash flows. A discount rate is selected to correspond with each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, consistent with that used for investment decisions considering the specific and detailed operating plans and strategies within each reporting unit. Projections of future cash flows differ by reporting unit and are consistent with our ongoing strategic projections. Future cash flows for Evernorth Health Services reporting units are primarily driven by the forecasted gross margins of the business, as well as operating expenses and long-term growth rates. Future cash flows for our other reporting units are primarily driven by forecasted revenues, benefit expenses, operating expenses and long-term growth rates.\nGoodwill Activity.\n Goodwill activity was as follows:\n(In millions)\nEvernorth Health Services\nCigna Healthcare\nTotal\nBalance at January 1, 2023\n$\n35,130\n \n$\n10,681\n \n$\n45,811\n \nGoodwill transferred to assets of businesses held for sale\n(1)\n—\n \n(\n1,553\n)\n(\n1,553\n)\nImpact of foreign currency translation and other adjustments\n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \nGoodwill at December 31, 2023\n35,130\n \n9,129\n \n44,259\n \nGoodwill acquired\n114\n \n—\n \n114\n \nImpact of foreign currency translation and other adjustments\n190\n \n(\n193\n)\n(\n3\n)\nGoodwill at December 31, 2024\n$\n35,434\n \n$\n8,936\n \n$\n44,370\n \n \n(1) \nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of 2024 and 2023 goodwill impairments.\nB.\nOther Intangible Assets\nAccounting Policy.\n The Company's Other intangible assets primarily include purchased customer and producer relationships, trademarks, and provider networks. The fair value of purchased customer relationships and the amortization method were determined as of the dates of purchase using an income approach that relies on projected future net cash flows, including key assumptions for customer attrition and discount rates. The Company's definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on an accelerated or straight-line basis, reflecting their pattern of economic benefits, over periods from \n6\n to \n30\n years. Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. Costs incurred to renew or extend the terms of these intangible assets are generally expensed as incurred.\n98\nThe Company's amortized intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the \ncarrying amount may not be recoverable.\n If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying asset group is less than the carrying amount of the asset group, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its estimated fair value. The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually by comparing their fair value with their carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, that excess is recognized as an impairment loss.\nComponents of Other Assets, Including Other Intangibles.\n \nOther intangible assets were comprised of the following:\n(In millions)\nCost\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Value\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n \n \nCustomer relationships\n$\n29,971\n \n$\n9,119\n \n$\n20,852\n \nTrade name - Express Scripts\n8,400\n \n8,400\n \nOther\n316\n \n131\n \n185\n \nOther intangible assets \n(1)\n38,687\n \n9,250\n \n29,437\n \nValue of business acquired (\"VOBA\" reported in Other assets) \n(2)\n211\n \n142\n \n69\n \nTotal\n$\n38,898\n \n$\n9,392\n \n$\n29,506\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nCustomer relationships\n$\n29,978\n \n$\n7,645\n \n$\n22,333\n \nTrade name - Express Scripts\n8,400\n \n8,400\n \nOther\n317\n \n110\n \n207\n \nOther intangible assets \n(1)\n38,695\n \n7,755\n \n30,940\n \nValue of business acquired (reported in Other assets) \n(2)\n211\n \n142\n \n69\n \nTotal\n$\n38,906\n \n$\n7,897\n \n$\n31,009\n \n(1)\n Includes $\n20\n million and $\n77\n million of Other intangible assets classified as assets of businesses held for sale as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(2)\n Includes $\n69\n million of VOBA classified as assets of businesses held for sale as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n \nThe Company has indefinite-lived intangible assets totaling $\n8.5\n billion at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, largely consisting of the Express Scripts trade name.\nC.\nProperty and Equipment\nAccounting Policy.\n Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes interest, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during construction when applicable. Internal-use software that is acquired, developed or modified solely to meet the Company's internal needs, with no plan to market externally, is also included in this category. Costs directly related to acquiring, developing or modifying internal-use software are capitalized.\nThe Company calculates depreciation and amortization principally using the straight-line method generally based on the estimated useful life of each asset as follows: buildings and improvements, \n10\n to \n40\n years; purchased and internally developed software, \n3\n to \n5\n years; and furniture and equipment (including computer equipment), \n3\n to \n10\n years. Improvements to leased facilities are depreciated over \nthe lesser of the remaining lease term or the estimated life of the improvement\n. The Company considers events and circumstances that would indicate the carrying value of property, equipment or capitalized software might not be recoverable. An impairment charge is recorded if the Company determines the carrying value of any of these assets is not recoverable. The Company also reviews and shortens the estimated useful lives of these assets, if necessary.\n99\nComponents of Property and Equipment.\n \nProperty and equipment was comprised of the following:\n(In millions)\nCost\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Value\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n \n \nInternal-use software\n$\n11,295\n \n$\n8,167\n \n$\n3,128\n \nOther property and equipment\n2,115\n \n1,287\n \n828\n \nTotal property and equipment \n(1)\n13,410\n \n9,454\n \n3,956\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nInternal-use software\n$\n10,155\n \n$\n7,161\n \n$\n2,994\n \nOther property and equipment\n2,282\n \n1,405\n \n877\n \nTotal property and equipment \n(1)\n12,437\n \n8,566\n \n3,871\n \n(1)\nIncludes $\n302\n million and $\n176\n million of Property and equipment net carrying value classified as assets of businesses held for sale as of December 31, 2024\n \nand\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n, \nrespectively.\nComponents of Depreciation and Amortization.\n \nDepreciation and amortization expense was comprised of the following:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInternal-use software\n$\n1,021\n \n$\n1,216\n \n$\n1,068\n \nOther property and equipment\n248\n \n260\n \n251\n \nValue of business acquired (reported in Other assets)\n—\n \n7\n \n12\n \nOther intangibles\n1,506\n \n1,552\n \n1,606\n \nTotal depreciation and amortization\n$\n2,775\n \n$\n3,035\n \n$\n2,937\n \nThe Company estimates annual pre-tax amortization for intangible assets, including internal-use software, over the next five calendar years to be as follows:\n(In millions)\nPre-tax Amortization\n2025\n$\n2,339\n \n2026\n$\n2,050\n \n2027\n$\n2,015\n \n2028\n$\n1,943\n \n2029\n$\n1,557\n \nNote 19 – Shareholders' Equity and Dividend Restrictions\nState insurance departments and foreign jurisdictions that regulate certain of the Company's subsidiaries prescribe accounting practices (differing in some respects from GAAP) to determine statutory net income and surplus. The Company's life, accident, and health insurance and Health Maintenance Organization (\"HMO\") subsidiaries are regulated by such statutory requirements. \nThe statutory net income of the Company's life, accident, and health insurance and HMO subsidiaries for the years ended, and their statutory surplus as of, December 31 were as follows:\n(In billions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n3.9\n \n$\n5.3\n \n$\n5.7\n \nSurplus\n$\n16.0\n \n$\n14.9\n \n$\n16.4\n \n100\nThe Company's HMO and life, accident and health insurance subsidiaries are also subject to minimum statutory surplus requirements and may be required to maintain investments on deposit with state departments of insurance or other regulatory bodies. Additionally, these subsidiaries may be subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of annual dividends or other distributions (such as loans or cash advances) that insurance companies may extend to their parent companies without prior approval. These amounts, including restricted GAAP net assets of the Company's subsidiaries, were as follows:\n(In billions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nMinimum statutory surplus required by regulators \n(1)\n$\n5.2\n \nInvestments on deposit with regulatory bodies\n$\n0.4\n \nMaximum dividend distributions permitted in 2025 without regulatory approval\n$\n3.9\n \nMaximum loans to the parent company permitted without regulatory approval\n$\n1.4\n \nRestricted GAAP net assets of subsidiaries of The Cigna Group\n$\n11.3\n \n(1)\n Excludes amounts associated with foreign operated equity method joint ventures.\nPermitted practices used by the Company's insurance subsidiaries in 2024 that differed from prescribed regulatory accounting had an immaterial impact on statutory surplus.\nUndistributed earnings for equity method investments are $\n1.2\n billion as of December 31, 2024\n.\nNote 20 – Income Taxes\nAccounting Policy.\n Deferred income taxes are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of the Company's underlying assets and liabilities, and are established based upon enacted tax rates and laws. Deferred income tax assets are recognized when available evidence indicates that realization is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established to the extent this standard is not met. The deferred income tax provision generally represents the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the reporting period excluding adjustments to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) or amounts recorded in connection with a business combination. The current income tax provision generally represents estimated amounts due on income tax returns for the year reported to various jurisdictions plus the effect of any uncertain tax positions. The Company uses the deferral method of accounting on investments that generate tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the related asset, which are generally reported in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognizes a liability for uncertain tax positions if management believes the probability that the positions will be sustained is 50% or less. For uncertain positions that management believes are more likely than not to be sustained, the Company recognizes a liability based upon management's estimate of the most likely settlement outcome with the taxing authority. The liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current when the position is expected to be settled within 12 months or the statute of limitation expires within 12 months.\nIncome taxes attributable to the Company's foreign operations are generally provided using the respective foreign jurisdictions' tax rate.\nA.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe components of income taxes were as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCurrent taxes\nU.S. income taxes\n$\n1,167\n \n$\n1,459\n \n$\n1,679\n \nForeign income taxes\n248\n \n161\n \n219\n \nState income taxes\n171\n \n180\n \n189\n \nTotal current taxes\n1,586\n \n1,800\n \n2,087\n \nDeferred taxes (tax benefits)\nU.S. income tax benefits\n(\n142\n)\n(\n533\n)\n(\n275\n)\nForeign income taxes (tax benefits)\n64\n \n(\n1,046\n)\n(\n28\n)\nState income tax benefits\n(\n17\n)\n(\n80\n)\n(\n169\n)\nTotal deferred tax benefits\n(\n95\n)\n(\n1,659\n)\n(\n472\n)\nTotal income taxes\n$\n1,491\n \n$\n141\n \n$\n1,615\n \n101\nTotal income taxes were different from the amount computed using the nominal federal income tax rate for the following reasons:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\n$\n%\n$\n%\n$\n%\nTax expense at nominal rate\n$\n1,107\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n1,158\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n1,763\n \n21.0\n \n%\nChange in valuation allowance\n767\n \n14.6\n \n1,290\n \n23.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \nState income tax (benefit), net of federal income tax benefit\n62\n \n1.2\n \n(\n39\n)\n(\n0.7\n)\n16\n \n0.2\n \nInvestment tax credits\n(\n111\n)\n(\n2.1\n)\n(\n48\n)\n(\n0.8\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\nImpact of businesses held for sale\n(\n129\n)\n(\n2.4\n)\n(\n213\n)\n(\n3.9\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nEffect of foreign earnings\n(\n252\n)\n(\n4.9\n)\n(\n173\n)\n(\n3.1\n)\n(\n96\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\nOther foreign tax attributes\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n153\n)\n(\n2.8\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nSwiss tax attributes\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1,674\n)\n(\n30.4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nImpact of sale of businesses\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n37\n)\n(\n0.4\n)\nOther\n47\n \n0.9\n \n(\n7\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\n(\n17\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\nTotal income taxes\n$\n1,491\n \n28.3\n \n%\n$\n141\n \n2.6\n \n%\n$\n1,615\n \n19.2\n \n%\nConsolidated pre-tax income from the Company's foreign operations was approximately \n62\n% of the Company's pre-tax income in 2024, \n48\n% in 2023 and \n46\n% in 2022. The increase over 2023 is primarily attributable to a reduction in domestic earnings driven by the current-year impairment of equity securities (discussed below).\nInvestment Tax Credits. \nCompany investments in renewable energy projects provided $\n1,057\n million, $\n453\n million and $\n129\n million of investment tax credits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company accounted for the tax credits using the deferral method and accordingly reduced the associated carrying value of the related assets by these amounts.\nImpairment of Equity Securities\n. \nIn 2024, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $\n636\n million and an equal amount of valuation allowance in connection with the impairment of equity securities. The valuation allowance had the effect of increasing the Company's effective tax rate.\n102\nB.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDeferred tax assets\n \nForeign tax attributes\n$\n1,752\n \n$\n1,827\n \nDeferred loss - sale of business\n773\n \n584\n \nInvestments\n561\n \n—\n \nOther insurance and contractholder liabilities\n300\n \n353\n \nLoss carryforwards\n270\n \n200\n \nOther accrued liabilities\n207\n \n244\n \nEmployee and retiree benefit plans\n177\n \n217\n \nUnrealized depreciation on investments and foreign currency translation\n93\n \n81\n \nPolicy acquisition expenses\n—\n \n39\n \nOther\n256\n \n242\n \nDeferred tax assets before valuation allowance\n4,389\n \n3,787\n \nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets\n(\n2,332\n)\n(\n1,498\n)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n2,057\n \n2,289\n \nDeferred tax liabilities\nAcquisition-related basis differences\n7,822\n \n8,105\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n243\n \n371\n \nPolicy acquisition expenses\n74\n \n—\n \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n8,139\n \n8,476\n \nNet deferred income tax liabilities \n(1)\n$\n(\n6,082\n)\n$\n(\n6,187\n)\n(1)\nDeferred tax liabilities, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, excludes $\n954\n million reported in Other assets and $\n61\n million reported in liabilities of businesses held for sale. Deferred tax liabilities, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023, excludes $\n1,055\n million\n \nreported in Other assets and $\n69\n million\n \nreported in liabilities of businesses held for sale.\n \nManagement believes that future results will be sufficient to realize the Company's gross deferred tax assets (\"DTAs\") that remain after valuation allowance. Valuation allowances have been established against certain federal, state and foreign tax attributes. There are multiple expiration dates associated with these tax attributes. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $\n880\n million in DTAs associated with the impairment of equity securities and other unrealized investment losses (See Note 11). As discussed above, a valuation allowance of $\n636\n million has been established against the DTAs related to the impairment of equity securities. We have determined that a valuation allowance against the remaining DTAs is not currently required based on the Company's loss carryback capacity and ability and intent to hold certain investment securities until recovery. \nForeign Jurisdiction Tax Attributes.\n As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had DTAs of approximately $\n1.8\n billion associated with foreign tax law changes and agreements in certain tax jurisdictions and a related $\n772\n million valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets based on projections of future earnings and requirements to utilize the assets within certain time periods. It is possible in future periods that the Company may revalue these net deferred tax assets due to modifications in certain assumptions, such as forecasted future earnings. \nSale of Medicare Advantage and Related Businesses\n. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has recorded $\n773\n million and $\n584\n million, respectively, of deferred tax benefits and a valuation allowance of $\n715\n million and $\n584\n million, respectively, in connection with the HCSC transaction. The valuation allowance has been recorded due to the uncertainty relative to the recovery of the deferred tax benefits as the Company does not anticipate having capital gain capacity to offset these capital losses. \n103\nC.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nReconciliations of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at January 1,\n$\n1,399\n \n$\n1,343\n \n$\n1,230\n \n(Decrease) increase due to prior year positions\n(\n7\n)\n(\n26\n)\n8\n \nIncrease due to current year positions\n165\n \n107\n \n137\n \nReduction related to settlements with taxing authorities\n(\n22\n)\n(\n13\n)\n(\n4\n)\nReduction related to lapse of applicable statute of limitations\n(\n58\n)\n(\n12\n)\n(\n28\n)\nBalance at December 31,\n$\n1,477\n \n$\n1,399\n \n$\n1,343\n \nSubstantially all unrecognized tax benefits would increase Shareholders' net income if recognized. \nThe Company classifies net interest expense on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense and in Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n In addition to the amounts in the table above, the liability for net interest expense on uncertain tax positions was approximately $\n228\n million, $\n220\n million and $\n176\n million as of December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nD.\nOther Tax Matters\nThe statutes of limitations for the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns through 2016 have closed. The statute of limitations for the Company's 2020 tax return has also closed. However, The Cigna Group filed amended returns for both the 2015 and 2016 tax years, which are under review by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). Additionally, the IRS is examining the Company's returns for 2017 and 2018. The IRS has examined Express Scripts' tax returns for 2010 through 2018, for which there remains significant disputed matters. In addition, the Company has pending refund claims for various years. The Company has established adequate reserves for these matters.\nThe Company conducts business in a number of state and foreign jurisdictions and may be engaged in multiple audit proceedings at any given time. Generally, no further state or foreign audit activity is expected for tax years prior to 2013 for Express Scripts entities and 2014 for all other entities of The Cigna Group.\nPillar Two. \nOn December 15, 2022, the European Union (\"EU\") Member States formally adopted the EU's Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU effective dates are January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. A significant number of other countries are also implementing similar legislation, and the OECD continues to release additional guidance on these rules. The Company is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules and continues to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework.\nNote 21 – Contingencies and Other Matters\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries, is contingently liable for various guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business.\nA.\nFinancial Guarantees: Retiree and Life Insurance Benefits\nThe Company guarantees that separate account assets will be sufficient to pay certain life insurance or retiree benefits. For the majority of these benefits, the sponsoring employers are primarily responsible for ensuring that assets are sufficient to pay these benefits and are required to maintain assets that exceed a certain percentage of benefit obligations. If employers fail to do so, the Company or an affiliate of the buyer of the retirement benefits business has the right to redirect the management of the related assets to provide for benefit payments.\n As of December 31, 2024, employers maintained assets that generally exceeded the benefit obligations under these arrangements of approximately $\n410\n million. \nAn additional liability is established if management believes that the Company will be required to make payments under the guarantees;\n there were \nno\n additional liabilities required for these guarantees, net of reinsurance, as of December 31, 2024. \nSeparate account assets supporting these guarantees are classified in Levels 1 and 2 of the GAAP fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company does not expect that these financial guarantees will have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\n104\nB.\nCertain Other Guarantees\nThe Company had indemnification obligations as of December 31, 2024 in connection with acquisition and disposition transactions. These indemnification obligations are triggered by the breach of representations or covenants provided by the Company, such as representations for the presentation of financial statements, filing of tax returns, compliance with laws or regulations, or identification of outstanding litigation. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential amount due is subject to contractual limitations based on a stated dollar amount or a percentage of the transaction purchase price, while in other cases limitations are not specified or applicable. The Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these obligations because not all amounts due under these indemnification obligations are subject to limitation.\n There were \nno\n recorded liabilities for these indemnification obligations as of December 31, 2024.\nC.\nGuaranty Fund Assessments\nThe Company operates in a regulatory environment that may require its participation in assessments under state insurance guaranty association laws. The Company's exposure to assessments for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants is based on its share of business written in the relevant jurisdictions. There were no material charges or credits resulting from existing or new guaranty fund assessments for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nD.\nLegal and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company is routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and audits, government investigations, including under the federal False Claims Act and state false claims acts initiated by a government investigating body or by a \nqui tam\n relator's filing of a complaint under court seal, and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of managing a global health company. Additionally, the Company has received and is cooperating with subpoenas or similar processes from various governmental agencies requesting information, all arising in the normal course of its business. Disputed tax matters arising from audits by the IRS or other state and foreign jurisdictions, including those resulting in litigation, are accounted for under GAAP guidance for uncertain tax positions, as described in Note 20.\nAccounting Policy. \nThe Company accrues for legal and regulatory matters when a loss contingency is both probable and estimable. The estimated loss is generally recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses and represents the Company's best estimate of the loss contingency. If the loss estimate is a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount in the range if no amount is better than any other estimated amount in the range. Legal costs to defend the Company's litigation and arbitration matters are expensed as incurred in cases that the Company cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost to defend. If the Company can reasonably estimate the cost to defend, a liability for these costs is accrued when the claim is reported.\n \nPending litigation and legal or regulatory matters that the Company has identified with a reasonably possible material loss and certain other material litigation matters are described below. For those matters that the Company has identified with a reasonably possible material loss, the Company provides disclosure in the aggregate of accruals and range of loss, or a statement that such information cannot be estimated. The Company's accrual for the matter discussed below under \"Litigation Matters\" is not material. Due to numerous uncertain factors presented in this case, it is not possible to estimate an aggregate range of loss (if any) for this matter at this time. In light of the uncertainties involved in this matter, there is no assurance that its ultimate resolution will not exceed the amount currently accrued by the Company. An adverse outcome in this matter could be material to the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity for any particular period. The outcomes of lawsuits are inherently unpredictable and we may be unsuccessful in this ongoing litigation matter or any future claims or litigation.\nLitigation Matters\nExpress Scripts Litigation with Elevance\n. In March 2016, Elevance Health, Inc. (\"Elevance\") filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging various breach of contract claims against Express Scripts relating to the parties' rights and obligations under the periodic pricing review section of the pharmacy benefit management agreement between the parties, including allegations that Express Scripts failed to negotiate new pricing concessions in good faith, as well as various alleged service issues. Elevance also requested that the court enter declaratory judgment that Express Scripts is required to provide Elevance competitive benchmark pricing, that Elevance can terminate the agreement, and that Express Scripts is required to provide Elevance with post-termination services at competitive benchmark pricing for one year following any termination by Elevance. Elevance claimed it is entitled to $\n13\n billion in additional pricing concessions over the remaining term of the agreement, as well as $\n1.8\n billion for one year following any contract termination by Elevance and $\n150\n million damages for service issues (\"Elevance's Allegations\"). On April 19, 2016, in response to Elevance's complaint, Express Scripts filed its answer denying Elevance's Allegations in their entirety and asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims against Elevance. The court subsequently granted Elevance's motion to dismiss \ntwo\n of \nsix\n counts of Express Scripts' amended counterclaims. Express Scripts filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on \n105\nAugust 27, 2021. Elevance completed filing of its Response to Express Scripts' Motion for Summary Judgment on October 16, 2021. Express Scripts filed its Reply in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment on November 19, 2021. On March 31, 2022, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Express Scripts on all of Elevance's pricing claims for damages totaling $\n14.8\n billion and on most of Elevance's claims relating to service issues. Elevance's only remaining service claims relate to the review or processing of prior authorizations, with alleged damages over $\n100\n million. On November 1, 2023, the parties signed a settlement agreement pursuant to which Express Scripts agreed to resolve the service-related claims. The settlement agreement is not an admission of liability or fault by Express Scripts, the Company or its subsidiaries. Following the settlement, Elevance retained the right to appeal the pricing-related claims that were previously dismissed by the court, and Express Scripts retained the ability to reassert its own pricing-related claims in the event any appeal by Elevance is successful. Elevance filed its Notice of Appeal of its pricing-related claims on December 12, 2023. Elevance filed its opening appellate brief on April 24, 2024. Express Scripts filed its answering appellate brief on July 24, 2024. The Second Circuit held oral arguments on Elevance's appeal on October 22, 2024. On October 31, 2024, the Second Circuit released a unanimous opinion summarily affirming the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Express Scripts. Elevance filed a petition for rehearing en banc on November 14, 2024; the petition was denied on December 19, 2024.\nNote 22 – Segment Information\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our segments. A description of our basis for reporting segment operating results is outlined below. \nIntersegment revenues primarily reflect pharmacy and care services transactions between the Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare segments. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") responsible for making decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assessing its performance.\nThe Company uses \"pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations\" and \"adjusted revenues\" as its principal financial measures of segment operating performance because management, including the CODM, believes these metrics reflect the underlying results of business operations and facilitate analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and profitability to enable resource allocation decisions. We define pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations as income (loss) before income taxes excluding pre-tax income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net investment gains/losses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and special items. The Cigna Group's share of certain investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. Special items are matters that management, including the CODM, believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. Adjusted income (loss) from operations is measured on an after-tax basis for consolidated results and on a pre-tax basis for segment results. \nThe Company defines adjusted revenues as total revenues excluding the following adjustments: special items and The Cigna Group's share of certain investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting. Special items are matters that management, including the CODM, believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. We exclude these items from this measure because management, including the CODM, believes they are not indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business.\n \nThe Company does not report total assets by segment because this is not a metric used by the CODM to allocate resources or evaluate segment performance.\nThe following table presents the special items charges (benefits) recorded by the Company, as well as the respective financial statement line items impacted: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In

In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in \nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).\n Based on management's assessment and the criteria set forth by COSO, it was determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company's independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of and has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report located in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChange in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, The Cigna Group's internal control over financial reporting. \nItem 9B.\n \nOTHER INFORMATION\nRule 10b5-1 Plan Elections\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, the following 10b5-1 director and officer trading plan arrangement \nchange\n occurred:\nOn \nDecember 11, 2024\n, \nRetired Maj.

The Cigna Group, through its predecessor companies, was incorporated in Delaware in 1981. Cigna Corporation was renamed The Cigna Group in February 2023.\nNote 2\n - See Note 7 – Debt included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of the short-term and long-term debt obligations of The Cigna Group and its subsidiaries.\nShort-term and Credit Facilities Debt\nRevolving Credit Agreements.\n Our revolving credit agreements provide us with the ability to borrow amounts for general corporate purposes, including for the purpose of providing liquidity support if necessary under our commercial paper program discussed below. As of December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n outstanding balances under these revolving credit agreements. \nIn April 2024, The Cigna Group replaced its previous revolving credit agreements and entered into the following revolving credit agreements (the \"Credit Agreements\"):\n•\nA $\n5.0\n billion \nfive-year\n revolving credit and letter of credit agreement that will mature in April 2029 with an option to extend the maturity date for additional \none-year\n periods, subject to consent of the banks. The Company can borrow up to $\n5.0\n billion under the credit agreement for general corporate purposes, with up to $\n500\n million available for issuance of letters of credit. \n•\nA $\n1.5\n billion \n364-day\n revolving credit agreement that will mature in April 2025. The Company can borrow up to $\n1.5\n billion under the credit agreement for general corporate purposes. This agreement includes the option to \"term out\" any revolving loans that are outstanding at maturity by converting them into a term loan maturing on the \none-year\n anniversary of conversion.\nEach of the Credit Agreements includes an option to increase commitments in an aggregate amount of up to $\n1.5\n billion across both facilities for a maximum total commitment of $\n8.0\n billion. The Credit Agreements allow for borrowings at either a base rate or an adjusted term Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\") plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the Company's senior unsecured credit ratings.\nEach facility also contains customary covenants and restrictions, including a financial covenant that the Company's leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreements, may not exceed \n60\n%, subject to certain exceptions upon the consummation of an acquisition. \nCommercial Paper. \nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes privately placed on a discounted basis through certain broker-dealers at any time not to exceed an aggregate amount of $\n6.5\n billion. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The net proceeds of issuances have been and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The commercial paper program had approximately $\n0.9\n billion outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and an average interest rate of \n4.65\n%.\nLong-Term Debt\nDebt Issuance and Debt Tender Offers. \nIn February 2024, we issued $\n4.5\n billion of new senior notes. The proceeds from this debt were used to pay the consideration for the cash tender offers as described below. We used the remaining net proceeds to fund the \nFS-5\nrepayment of our senior notes that matured in March 2024 and for general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness and repurchases of shares of our common stock. Interest on this debt is paid semiannually.\nPrincipal\nMaturity Date\nInterest Rate\nNet Proceeds\nRedeemable Date\n(1)\n\"Make Whole\" Premium \n(2)\n$\n1,000\n million\nMay 15, 2029\n5.000\n%\n$\n995\n million\nApril 15, 2029\n15\n$\n750\n million\nMay 15, 2031\n5.125\n%\n$\n746\n million\nMarch 15, 2031\n15\n$\n1,250\n million\nFebruary 15, 2034\n5.250\n%\n$\n1,244\n million\nNovember 15, 2033\n20\n$\n1,500\n million\nFebruary 15, 2054\n5.600\n%\n$\n1,485\n million\nAugust 15, 2053\n20\n(1)\n Redeemable at any time prior to this date at a \"make whole\" premium, defined below. Redeemable at par on or after this date.\n(2)\n \"Make whole\" premium calculated using the most directly comparable U.S. Treasury rate plus the amount of basis points set forth in this column.\n \nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the repurchase of $\n1.7\n billion in aggregate principal amount of existing senior notes that were tendered to the Company pursuant to cash tender offers.\nDebt Maturities. \nMaturities of the Company's long-term debt are as follows:\n(In millions)\n \n2025\n$\n1,973\n \n2026\n$\n2,301\n \n2027\n$\n2,056\n \n2028\n$\n3,800\n \n2029\n$\n1,000\n \nMaturities after 2029\n$\n19,292\n \nDebt Covenants. \nThe Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2024.\nNote 3\n - The Company's intercompany receivables consist primarily of net intercompany loan amounts due from Evernorth Health, Inc. of $\n8.5\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Interest income on the loan receivable was accrued at an average rate of \n5.50\n% in 2024.\nThe Company's intercompany payables primarily reflect intercompany balances due to affiliates as of December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company settled the majority of outstanding intercompany payables via non-cash capital transactions.\nNote 4\n - The Company guaranteed approximately $\n9.4\n billion primarily related to intercompany indebtedness and financial obligations of certain direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. There were immaterial liabilities required for these guarantees as of December 31, 2024. \nNote 5\n - In February 2024, as part of our existing share repurchase program, we entered into separate accelerated share repurchase agreements with Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of America, N.A. to repurchase $\n3.2\n billion of common stock in aggregate. The total number of shares of our common stock repurchased under the agreements was approximately \n9.3\n million.\nFS-6\n \nTHE CIGNA GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSCHEDULE II\nVALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS AND RESERVES\n(In millions)\nBalance at Beginning of Year\nCharged (Credited) to Costs and Expenses\nCharged (Credited) to Other Accounts\nOther Deductions\nBalance at End of Year\nDescription\n2024\n \n \n \n \n \nInvestment asset valuation reserves\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\n$\n33\n \n$\n87\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n9\n)\n$\n111\n \nCommercial mortgage loans\n$\n31\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n30\n \nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n163\n \n$\n176\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n(\n152\n)\n$\n186\n \nDeferred tax asset valuation allowance\n$\n1,498\n \n$\n866\n \n$\n(\n32\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n2,332\n \nReinsurance recoverables \n$\n35\n \n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n30\n \n2023\nInvestment asset valuation reserves\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\n$\n44\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n22\n)\n$\n33\n \nCommercial mortgage loans\n$\n21\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n31\n \nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n160\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n(\n88\n)\n$\n163\n \nDeferred tax asset valuation allowance \n$\n208\n \n$\n1,286\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,498\n \nReinsurance recoverables\n$\n35\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n35\n \n2022\nInvestment asset valuation reserves\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\n$\n23\n \n$\n43\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n22\n)\n$\n44\n \nCommercial mortgage loans\n$\n6\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n21\n \nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n126\n \n$\n99\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n65\n)\n$\n160\n \nDeferred tax asset valuation allowance \n$\n246\n \n$\n(\n13\n)\n$\n(\n25\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n208\n \nReinsurance recoverables\n$\n28\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n35\n \nFS-7"
