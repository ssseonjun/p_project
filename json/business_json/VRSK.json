    "item1": "Item 1\n. Business for further discussion.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur clients use our solutions to make better decisions about risk and opportunities with greater efficiency and discipline. We refer to these products and services as “solutions” due to the integration among our services and the flexibility that enables our clients to purchase components or the comprehensive package. These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models, or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions. We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our clients’ revenues and help them better manage their costs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      28\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n \n\n\nKey Performance Metrics\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenue growth\n. We use year-over-year revenue growth as a key performance metric. We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers, and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA.\n We use year-over-year EBITDA growth as a key performance metric. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets. We calculate EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. The respective nearest applicable GAAP financial measures are net income and net income margin. Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in their evaluation of companies; EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating income, net income, or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP. Management uses EBITDA and EBITDA margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment company performance. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Some of these limitations involved in the use of EBITDA are: \n\n\n \n\n\n• EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.\n\n\n \n\n\n• EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.\n\n\n \n\n\n• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\n\n\n \n\n\n• Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA growth\n. We use EBITDA growth as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth. EBITDA growth allows for greater transparency regarding our operating performance and facilitate period-to-period comparison.\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA margin.\n We use EBITDA margin as a performance measure to assess segment performance and scalability of our business. We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      29\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\nWe earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions, advisory/consulting services, and for transactional solutions, recurring and non-recurring. Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one to five years and automatically renewed each year. As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition \nof revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments. Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database, or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period. In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business. Approximately 81% and 80% of the revenues in our Insurance segment for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively, were derived from hosted subscriptions through agreements for our solutions, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also provide advisory/consulting services, which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions. In addition, certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis, recurring and non-recurring. For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to access property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P&C insurance or a workers' compensation claim with information in our databases, or use our repair cost estimation solutions on a case-by-case basis. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, approximately 19% and 20% of our consolidated revenues, respectively, were derived from providing transactional and advisory/consulting solutions, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nPrincipal Operating Costs and Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\nPersonnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel expenses, which represented approximately 56% and 57% of our total operating expenses (excluding gains/losses related to dispositions) for each of the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs\n, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe assign personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee. We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, salespeople, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses. A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhile we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues. Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses. However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses, which may offset margin expansion.\n\n\n \n\n\nCost of Revenues.\n Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses. Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions, and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions. Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense.\n Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs. A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance, and communications are allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee. Our selling, general and administrative expenses exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      30\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrends Affecting Our Business\n\n\n \n\n\nA significant change in the profitability of P&C insurers could affect the demand for our solutions. The keys to profitability for insurers include premium growth, increasing investment income, and disciplined and accurate underwriting of risks. The growth of direct written premiums for P&C insurers has exhibited cyclical patterns, with total industry premium growth declining from a peak of 14.8% in 2002 to a trough of (3.1)% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 5.1% in 2019. In 2020, industry premium growth declined to 2.3% due to the impact of the pandemic. Direct premium growth accelerated to 9.5% in 2021, 9.7% in 2022, and further increased to 10.4% in 2023, indicating a continued recovery from the pandemic. Based on the most recent results available, written premiums continued to grow in 2024 at a comparable level.\n\n\n \n\n\nWith inflation remaining above pre-pandemic levels throughout 2024 and the CPI consistently exceeding the 2% target, reaching 2.9% in December, the Federal Reserve took timely action to adjust its monetary policy and reduce interest rates.  The federal funds rate was reduced from a target range of 5.25-5.5% early in 2024 to a target range of 4.25-4.5% range by the end of December. Reductions in interest rates can lead to increased consumer spending and investment, resulting in higher demand for insurance products as individuals and businesses seek to protect their assets. In such cases, comprehensive data analysis and risk assessment support can help insurers significantly improve their operations. It enables more accurate calculations and provides a broad, systemic view of the market.\n\n\n \n\n\nDespite some progress made towards actuarially sound pricing, carriers are still working to improve loss ratios and profitability in the face of heightened inflation. Until premium pricing adjustments are fully implemented, and profitability improves, some carriers are not yet spending as much as they have in the past to drive new policy volume, which could have a short-term impact on demand and volume for our Marketing Solutions offerings and auto underwriting solutions.\n\n\n \n\n\nInsurers’ annualized yield on investments (not attributable to cash transfers from outside the P&C industry) was 2.5% as of the first nine months of 2024, down from the 3.2% yield at year-end 2023 despite still moderately high interest rates (compared to the pre-pandemic period) in 2024. These recent investment results are lower than the historical 15-year average of 3.3%, showing that yields on investments, a major component of insurers’ balance sheets, have yet to follow the trend in interest rates.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe trend of high catastrophe losses for insurers that began in 2020 continued through 2024. Insurance losses in these five latest years were more than 1.75 times the losses in the prior five years (2015-2019). Both 2023 and 2024 reflected a record high for the number of catastrophes recorded in a single year. But while those 2023 catastrophes translated into the lowest financial losses in any year since the pandemic, 2024, however, brought much greater catastrophic impacts that resulted in significant losses. The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was the second most expensive on record, surpassed only by the 2017 season. Although Hurricane Helene was the deadliest, causing massive flooding in North Carolina and significant property damage and loss of life, most of the damage was caused by Hurricane Milton, one of the strongest tropical cyclones to hit the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Hurricane Beryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, caused widespread devastation as it crossed the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. And 2025 is off to an active start with the latest breakout of wildfires in California with insured industry losses to property that our Extreme Event Solutions group has estimated could be as much as $35.0 billion.\n\n\n \n\n\nThese trends in catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses (such as from weather, climate, casualty, terrorism, pandemics, and tsunamis) can influence our customers’ profitability, and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks. Any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of these events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions. Likewise, any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products. A portion of our revenue is also related to the number of claims processed due to losses, which can be impacted by seasonal storm or wildfire activity. The need by our customers to fight insurance fraud - both in claims and at policy inception - could also lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      31\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription of Acquisitions\n\n\n \n\n\nWe acquired 8 businesses since January 1, 2022. These acquisitions affect the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between periods. See a description of our \n2024\n acquisition below and \nNote 10\n. Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussions.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn  January 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 100 percent of Rocket Enterprise Solutions GmbH (\"Rocket\") for a net cash purchase price of $10.1 million, of which $2.2 million represents a deferred payment and $0.3 million represents a holdback payment. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill as we did not incur any material liabilities. Rocket’s strong property claims and underwriting technology has been widely adopted by many of the largest insurers and service providers across Germany and Austria. Rocket has become a part of our claims category. The acquisition, which follows a strategic investment by Verisk in Rocket in 2022, will further Verisk's expansion in Europe and the Company’s goal of helping insurers and claims service providers leverage more holistic data and technology tools to enhance the claims experience.\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of Dispositions\n\n\n \n\n\nIn December 2024, we sold Atmospheric and Environmental Research (\"AER\") for $7.1 million. The sale resulted in a loss of $12.1 million that was included within \"Other operating (loss) income\" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of Discontinued Operations\n\n\n \n\n\nSee a description of our 2023 disposition below and within \nNote 11\n. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussions.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy business to Planet Jersey Buyer Ltd, an entity that was formed on behalf of, and is controlled by, The Veritas Capital Fund VIII, L.P. and its affiliated funds and entities (“Veritas Capital”), for a net cash sale price of $3,066.4 million paid at closing (reflecting a base purchase price of $3,100.0 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for, among other things, the cash, working capital, and indebtedness of the companies as of the closing) and up to $200.0 million of additional contingent cash consideration based on Veritas Capital’s future return on its investment paid through a Class C Partnership interest.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Energy business, which was part of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment, was classified as discontinued operations per ASC 205-20 as we determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, that this transaction represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Additionally, all assets and liabilities of the Energy business were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the held for sale classification, we recognized an impairment of $303.7 million on the remeasurement of the disposal group held for sale, which has been included in discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations. Upon classification of the Energy business as held for sale, its cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment within shareholders’ equity was included with its carrying value, which primarily resulted in the impairment. When we closed on and completed the sale of our Energy business on February 1, 2023, we recognized a loss of $128.4 million. As a result of closing adjustments in the second and fourth quarter of 2023, we incurred an additional net loss of $2.7 million.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nConsolidated Results of Continuing Operations\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenues were \n$2,881.7\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$2,681.4\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, an increase of \n$200.3\n million or \n7.5%\n.

Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for an increase of $6.1 million in cost of revenues, which was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. The remaining cost of revenues increase of $18.5 million or 2.1% was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of\n $8.3\n \nmillion, information technology expense of $6.9\n \nmillion, data costs of $\n6.3\n million, bad debt expense of $\n5.6\n million, and fees and membership costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in rent expense of $3.3 million, a decrease of $2.2 million on the disposal of fixed assets, $1.5 million gain primarily related to our Jersey City lease modification, decreases in office expense of $\n0.8\n million, insurance expense of $0.7 million, professional consulting fees of $0.5 million, and other operating costs of $0.3 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SGA\") w\nere \n$408.7\n m\nillion for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$391.8\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, an increase of \n$16.9\n million or \n4.3%\n. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for an increase of $22.7 million in SGA. This increase was primarily due to an acquisition-related earn-out credit of $20.0 million in the prior year that did not recur in the current period. The offsetting decrease of $\n5.8\n million or \n1.4\n% was primarily due to a \nprior year litigation reserve expense of $38.2 million related to our former Financial Services segment, decreases in fees and membership costs of $3.2 million, bad debt expense of $1.1 million, and other operating costs of $1.2 million, partially offset by an \nincrease in professional consulting fees of $15.8 million\n, salaries and employee benefits of $12.3 million, a $6.5 million loss on the disposal of assets primarily due to a write-off of leasehold improvements related to our lease modification, increases in insurance expense of $2.0 million, and information technology expense of $1.3 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets was \n$233.6\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$206.8\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, an increase of \n$26.8\n million or \n13.0%\n. The increase was primarily due to the timing of certain large internally developed software projects that were completed and placed into service in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease due to our recent disposition of $0.3 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nAmortization of intangible assets was \n$72.3\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$74.6\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, a decrease of \n$2.3\n million or \n3.1%\n. The decrease was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized, partially offset by an increase due to our recent acquisition of $0.3 million.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Other operating loss (income)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther operating loss (income) was \n$12.1\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$0.0\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n.

The increase in net income margin was primarily driven by net gains associated with the settlement of retained interests related to the prior sales of our healthcare business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022, the early extinguishment of debt, discussed above, and a prior year litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment, partially offset by the loss recognized on the sale of AER. The net income margin for December 31, 2023 included a loss from discontinued operations of $154.0 million, which negatively impacted our net income margin by 5.7%.\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA Margin [1]\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA was $1,659.1 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to $1,424.1 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n. The EBITDA margin for our consolidated results was \n57.6\n% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to 53.1% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n. The increase was primarily driven by strong revenue growth and cost discipline, a prior year litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment, and net gains associated with the prior sales of our healthcare business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022.\n\n\n \n\n\n[1] Note: Consolidated EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as a percentage of consolidated revenue.

This transaction did not qualify as discontinued operations per the guidance in ASC 205-20. The Energy business within the \"Energy and Specialized Markets\" segment was classified as discontinued operations per the guidance in ASC 205-20. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. On February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy business.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn April 8, 2022, we completed the sale of Verisk Financial Services, our Financial Services segment, to TransUnion.

Our recent acquisitions (Morning Data within the underwriting category of our Insurance segment; and Mavera and Krug within the claims category of the Insurance segment) increased net revenues by $32.4 million. The remaining growth in revenues of $212.0 million or 8.7% is related to increased revenues within our Insurance segment. Refer to the Results of Operations by Segment within this section for more information regarding our revenues. Our Specialized Market business was sold in March 2022; and our Energy business, which qualified for discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2022, was subsequently sold in Februar\ny 2023.

Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for a net decrease of $16.5 million in cost of revenues, which was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. The cost of revenues increase of $68.4 million or 8.7% was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $51.0 million, rent expense of $6.6 million, bad debt expense of $3.8 million, travel expenses of $3.6 million, data costs of $1.8 million, and other operating costs of $3.9 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in information technology expenses of $2.1 million and professional consulting fees $0.2 million\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SGA\") were $391.8 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $381.5 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n, an increase of $10.3 million or 2.7%. Our recent acquisitions, primarily related to salaries and benefits of $24.5 million, contributed to the increase, offset by our recent dispositions and acquisition-related earn-out costs, which accounted for decreases of $34.1 million and $16.5 million, respectively. The remaining SGA increase of $36.4 million or 10.0% was primarily due to a litigation reserve expense of $38.2 million associated with an indemnification of an ongoing inquiry related to our former Financial Services segment, increases in travel expenses of $3.9 million, professional consulting fees (mostly related to ERP costs) of $3.4 million, information technology expenses of $0.6 million, and other operating costs of $0.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $10.6 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $206.8 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $164.2 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n, an increase of $42.6 million or 25.9%. The increase was primarily driven by $44.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense attributed to an increase in assets placed into service to support revenue growth and recent acquisitions of $0.2 million, partially offset by $2.2 million related to recent dispositions. The increase in assets placed into service in 2023 primarily resulted from the timing of certain large internally developed software projects that were completed and placed into service during the year.\n\n\n \n\n\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nAmortization of intangible assets w\nas $74.6 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $74.4 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n, an increase of $0.2 million or 0.3%. The increase was primarily driven by recent acquisitions of $3.7 million, partially offset by our recent dispositions of $3.5 million.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      36\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Operating Income\n\n\n \n\n\nOther operating income was $0.0 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $354.2 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n. The gain in the prior year was primarily driven by the sale of 3E and Financial Services segment recognized in the prior year.\n\n\n \n\n\nInvestment Income (Loss) and Others, Net\n\n\n \n\n\nInvestment income (loss) and others, net was\n a gain of $11.0 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to a loss of $5.3 million f\nor the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to impact of foreign currencies.\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest Expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest expense was $115.5 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $138.8 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n, a decrease of $23.3 million or 16.8%. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the paydown in the current year of our outstanding borrowings on our Syndicated Revolving and Bilateral credit facilities, and an increase in interest income of $15.8 million, partially offset by interest expense related to the issuance of our 2033 Senior Notes.\n\n\n \n\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $258.8 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $220.3 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n. The effective tax rate was 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to tax rate benefits in 2022 related to the sale of 3E and a release of a United Kingdom valuation allowance associated with interest expense utilization. In addition, the tax rate for 2023 was higher than the prior year due to tax charges incurred in structuring the Energy sale in the first quarter and the unfavorable impact of the litigation reserve expense, described above, that is anticipated to be mostly non-deductible.\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Income Margin\n\n\n \n\n\nThe net income margin for our consolidated results was 22.9% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to 38.2% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n. The decrease in net income margin was primarily driven by the net gain from dispositions in the prior year, as well as the current year litigation reserve expense described above.\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA Margin [1]\n\n\n \n\n\nThe EBITDA margin for our consolidated\n results was 53.1% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to 65.7% for\n the year ended December 31, 2022.

available-for-sale securities totaling $292.5 million and $303.9 million, respectively. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in higher credit quality financial institutions in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \nDecember 31, 2023\n, a vast majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents is with TD Bank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase N.A. Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year. Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year. We have historically generated significant cash flows from operations. As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our Credit Facility, we expect that we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to fuel our future growth plans.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered. When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a liability (deferred revenues). This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services. In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows. Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\n were $223.9 million, $230.0 million, and $274.7 million, respectively. Expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal-use software and are capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40, \nAccounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe have historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\n, we repurchased $1,005.0 million, $2,762.3 million, and $1,662.5 million, respectively, of our common stock. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\n, we also paid dividends of $221.3 million, $196.8 million, and $195.2 million, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nFinancing and Financing Capacity\n\n\n \n\n\nWe had total deb\nt, excluding finance lease obligations, unamortized discounts and premium, and debt issuance costs, of $3,050.0 million and $2,850.0 million at \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively. The debt at \nDecember 31, 2024\n primarily consists of senior notes issued in 2024, 2023, 2020, 2019, and 2015. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually each year. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were recorded as \"Long-term debt\" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized to \"Interest expense\" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this Form 10-K over the life of the respective senior note. The indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding notes, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See \nNote 15\n. Debt for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have a $1,000 million Syndicated Credit Facility with Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., TD Bank, N.A., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and the Northern Trust Company with a maturity date of April 5, 2028. Borrowing under the facility is payable at an interest rate of SOFR plus 100.0 to 162.5 basis points, depending on the public debt rating. The financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of less than 3.75 to 1.0\n.\n At our election, the maximum consolidated funded debt leverage ratio could be permitted to increase to 4.50 to 1.0 (no more than once) and to 4.25 to 1.0 (no more than once) in connection with the closing of a permitted acquisition. The Syndicated Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, and the Repurchase Program. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we were in compliance with all financial and other debt covenants under the Syndicated Credit Facility. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \nDecember 31, 2023\n, the available capacity under the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility was $995.4 million, which takes into account outstanding letters of credit of $4.6 million. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      39\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash Flow\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n2024\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n2023\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n2022\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n(in millions)\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,144.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,060.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,059.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(124.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,746.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n301.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNet cash used in financing activities\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,028.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(3,786.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,330.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOperating Activities\n\n\n \n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was \n$1,144.0\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$1,060.7\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, an increase of \n$83.3\n million, or \n7.9%\n. \nThe increase in operating cash flow was due to an increase in operating profit, offset by an increase in interest payments.\n\n\n \n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was \n$1,060.7\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to \n$1,059.0\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022\n, an increase of \n$1.7\n million, or \n0.2%\n. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflects an increase in the operating profit of our Insurance segment and lower tax payments in 2023, offset by the disposition of our Energy business in February 2023.

of excise tax of $25.2 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, $590.2 million from the proceeds of loan-term debt net of original issuance discount, and proceeds

The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefits, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      41\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\n\n \n\n\nStock-based compensation cost, including nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, performance share units tied to the achievement of certain market performance conditions, namely relative total shareholder return as compared to the S&P 500 index (\"TSR-based PSU's\"), and performance share units tied to the achievement of certain financial performance conditions, namely incremental return on invested capital (\"ROIC-based PSUs\"), is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock options is measured using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and expected dividend yield. The stock options have an exercise price equal to the adjusted closing price of our common stock on the grant date with a ten-year contractual term. The fair value of the restricted stock is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The restricted stock is not assignable or transferable until it becomes vested. The fair value of TSR-based PSUs is determined on the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation model and their ultimate achievement is based on relative total shareholder return as compared to the companies that compromise the S&P 500 index. The fair value of ROIC-based PSUs is determined on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date and their ultimate achievement is tied to incremental return on invested capital based on net operating profit. Each of the TSR-based PSUs and ROIC-based PSUs has a three-year performance period, subject to the recipients continued service. Each PSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock and the ultimate realization is based on our achievement of certain market and financial performance criteria and may range from 0% to 200% of the recipients target levels of 100% established on the grant date.\n\n\n \n\n\nOption grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period. PSUs are generally expensed ratably over the three-year vesting period. We follow the substantive vesting period approach which requires that stock-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest. The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.\n\n\n \n\n\nInternally Developed Software\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   We capitalize certain development costs incurred in connection with internally developed software. These capitalized costs primarily pertain to software hosted by us and accessed by customers. Costs during the initial development stages are expensed as they occur. Once an application reaches the development stage, both internal and external costs are capitalized if they are direct and incremental, until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization stops upon completion of all significant testing. Additionally, we capitalize costs associated with specific software upgrades and enhancements when the expenditures result in additional features and functionality. Once in service, internally developed software assets are assessed for recoverability and impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Any impairment, as identified, is calculated as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value, using acceptable valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as circumstances require.\n  \n\n\n \n\n\nGoodwill and Intangibles\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had goodwill of $1,726.6 million, which represents 40.5% of our total assets. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may decide to first perform a qualitative assessment, or “Step Zero” impairment test, to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred. The qualitative assessment includes a review of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, internal cost factors, and our own overall financial and share price performance, among other factors. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of our reporting units exceeds their fair value, we perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. As of June 30, 2024, we completed our Step Zero impairment test at the reporting unit level and determined it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of our reporting units exceeded their fair values. We did not recognize any additional impairment charges related to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Subsequent to the test performed on June 30, 2024, we continued to monitor these reporting units for events that would trigger an interim impairment test; we did not identify any such events.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. The estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of third-party specialists, a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n\n \n\n\nPension and Postretirement\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit (credit) cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.\n  \n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n   In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees. As part of our ev\n   \naluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans. Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date. The outputs from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices. For our pension plans at \n\n   December 31, 2024\n   \n, we determined this rate to be 5.64% and 5.37% at \n\n   December 31, 2024 and 2023\n   \n, respectively. Our postretirement rate was 5.17% and 4.75% at \n\n   December 31, 2024 and 2023\n   \n, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      42\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment. Our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 60% debt securities and 40% equity securities. As of December 31, 2024, the pension plan assets were allocated 57.5% debt securities, 36.5% equity securities, 4.9% real estate and 1.1% other. The VEBA Plan target allocation is 100% debt securities. We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan. The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit (credits) costs. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. We amortize, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. For our pension and postretirement plans, the total actuarial losses as of December 31, 2024 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $122.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively, and we expect to recognize a net periodic pension and postretirement expenses of $4.2 million and \n$0.3 million,\n respectively, in 2025 related to the amortization of actuarial losses.\n\n\n \n\n\nA one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nPension\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nPostretirement\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n1% Decrease\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n1% Increase\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n1% Decrease\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n1% Increase\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nBenefit (Credit) Cost\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nProjected Benefit Obligation\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nBenefit (Credit) Cost\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nProjected Benefit Obligation\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nBenefit (Credit) Cost\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nProjected Benefit Obligation\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nBenefit (Credit) Cost\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nProjected Benefit Obligation\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDiscount Rate\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n23.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(20.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExpected Rate of Return on Assets\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(4.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\nIn projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with \nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of ASC 740\n, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe estimate unrecognized tax positions o\nf $0.9\n \nmillion that may be \nrecognized by December 31, 2025, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforw\nards of $53.0 \nmilli\non, which will expire at various dates from 2025 through 2044. Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYears Ending\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n(in millions)\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025 - 2032\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n16.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2033 - 2037\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2038 - 2044\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n53.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n \n\n\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to \nNote 2(s)\n to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      43\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 7A.\n \n\n\n \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at an interest rate of SOFR plus 100.0 to 162.5 basis points, depending upon our public debt rating. A commitment fee on any unused commitment is payable periodically and may range from 8.0 to 17.5 basis points based upon our public debt rating. A change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. \n\n\n \n\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\n\n \n\n\nOur foreign-based businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the U.S. dollar to British pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates. A portion of our revenue is denominated in British pounds and other foreign currencies. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against British pounds and other foreign currencies, our revenues reported in U.S. dollars would decline. With regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in British pounds and other foreign currencies. If British pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen, costs reported in U.S. dollars will increase. Movements in the U.S. dollar to British pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. A hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 8.\n \n\n\n \nConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe information required by this Item is set forth on pages 53 through 96 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 9.\n \n\n\n \nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNone.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      44\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 9A.\n \n\n\n \nControls and Procedures\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives at the reasonable assurance level.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur management, with the participation of the Chief \nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K for our Company and subsidiaries other than our recent acquisition in \n2024\n (See \nNote 10\n of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K). Management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of this acquisition because it represents less than 0.1% of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets which were integrated into our systems and control environment) and less than 0.1% of revenues as of and for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n. Based upon the foregoing assessments, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n\n\n \n\n\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\n \n\n\nThe information required by this Item is set forth on page 46 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n \n\n\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\n \n\n\nThe information required by this Item is set forth on page 47 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n \n\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are in the process of integrating our recent acquisition in 2024 into our overall internal control over financial reporting process. Other than this ongoing integration, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      45\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\n\n \n\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n \n\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in\n \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\n\n\n \n\n\nBased on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nManagement excluded from its assessment the internal control over\n financial reporting for our acquisition in \n2024\n (See \nNote 10\n of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K).

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs described in\n \nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\n, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Rocket Enterprise Solutions GmbH (\"Rocket\"), which was acquired on January 8, 2024. The financial statements of Rocket constitute less than 0.1% of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets which were integrated into the Company's systems and control environment) and less than 0.1% of revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Rocket\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying \nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\n. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\n \n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\n \n\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n \n\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\n\n\n \n\n\nMorristown, New Jersey\n\n\nFebruary 26, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      47\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nItem \n9B.\n \n \nOther Information\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10b5\n-\n1\n Trading Plans\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended \n December 31, 2024\n, the following Section \n16\n officers and directors adopted, modified or terminated a “Rule \n10b5\n-\n1\n trading arrangement” (as defined in Item \n408\n of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act):\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n●\n \n \nL\nee M.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control \n—\n Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\n \n\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\n \n\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\n\n \n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\n \n\n\nFixed Assets - Capitalization of Software Development Costs - Refer to Notes 2 and 9 to the financial statements \n\n\n \n\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\n\n \n\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company’s capitalized software development costs primarily relate to internal-use software. Such costs are capitalized in the application development stage in accordance with ASC 350-40, \nInternal-use Software\n. Costs in the preliminary and post-implementation stages are typically expensed as incurred. Internal software development costs capitalized as of December 31, 2024 was $1,334.8 million and the related accumulated amortization was $837.4 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe identified capitalized internal software development costs as a critical audit matter because of the inherent complexity and level of judgment involved in assessing management's determination of qualifying activities during the application development stage for capitalization. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort to evaluate the appropriateness of management’s decisions regarding which activities qualify for capitalization and when a product reaches the application development stage.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    51\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\n\n \n\n\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s capitalization of internal software development costs included the following, among others:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n●\nWe conducted inquiries with management to understand the processes and controls in place for identifying and capitalizing internal software development costs.\n\n\n \n●\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over:\n\n\n \n \n○\nThe identification and tracking of internal software development costs, including controls related to the authorization and approval of capitalizable costs.\n\n\n \n \n○\nThe allocation of employee time and other resources to capitalizable projects, ensuring that only eligible costs were capitalized.\n\n\n \n●\nWe selected a sample of internal software development costs. For the selected samples, we performed testing to evaluate whether the costs met the capitalization criteria under the relevant accounting standards, including inspecting supporting documentation such as timesheets, invoices, project plans, and conducting inquiries with project managers.\n\n\n \n●\nWe assessed the completeness and accuracy of the data used by management in the capitalization process by reconciling the data with source documents, such as payroll records and vendor invoices, and ensuring that all relevant expenses were captured and recorded to validate that no capitalizable costs were omitted.\n\n\n \n●\nWe evaluated any indicators of project delays or cancellations by reviewing project status reports, conducting inquiries with project managers, and evaluating the impact of any identified indicators on the capitalization of costs and the determination of the in service date.\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n /s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nMorristown, New

STATEMENTS\n\n\n(Amounts in millions, except for share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n1.\n    Organization:\n\n\n \n\n\nVerisk Analytics, Inc. (the \"Company\") is a strategic data analytics and technology partner to the global insurance industry. We empower clients to strengthen operating efficiency, improve underwriting and claims outcomes, combat fraud and make informed decisions about global risks, including climate change, extreme events, sustainability, and political issues. Through advanced data analytics, software, scientific research, and deep industry knowledge, we help build global resilience for individuals, communities, and businesses. We trade under the ticker symbol \"VRSK\" on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n2.\n    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\n\n\n \n\n\nOur accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include acquisition purchase price allocations, the fair value of goodwill, the realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities, acquisition-related liabilities, fair value of stock-based compensation for equity awards granted, and assets and liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits. Actual results \n may \nultimately differ from those estimates.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn \n February 1, 2023, \nwe completed the sale of our Energy business. We determined that the sale of our Energy business met the “discontinued operations” criteria in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) \n205\n-\n20,\n \nDiscontinued Operations\n (“ASC \n205\n-\n20”\n) due to its relative size and strategic rationale. The consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements were recasted for all periods presented to reflect the discontinuation of the Energy business, in accordance with ASC \n205\n-\n20.\n The discussion in the notes to these consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise noted, relate solely to our continuing operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nSignificant accounting policies include the following:\n\n\n \n\n\n(a)    \nIntercompany Accounts and Transactions\n\n\n \n\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include all of our accounts. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n\n \n\n\n(b)    \nRevenue Recognition\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following describes our primary types of revenues and the applicable revenue recognition policies. We recognize revenues through recurring and non-recurring long-term agreements (generally \none\n to \nfive\n years) for hosted subscriptions, advisory/consulting services, and for transactional solutions. Our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of services where revenue is recognized when or as control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Fees for services provided by us are non-refundable. Revenue is recognized net of applicable sales tax withholdings.\n\n\n \n\n\nHosted Subscriptions\n\n\n \n\n\nWe offer hosted subscriptions, where customers access content only through our online portal (the \"Hosted Subscription\"). We grant a license to our customer to enter our online portal. The license is a contractual mechanism that allows our customer to access our online portal for a defined period of time. As the license alone does \nnot\n provide utility to our customer, our customer has \nno\n contractual right to take possession of our online portal at any time, and our customer cannot engage another party to host our online portal and related content, it is \nnot\n considered a functional license under ASC \n606,\n \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers \n(\"ASC \n606\"\n). Our promise to our customer is to provide continuous access to our online portal and to update the content throughout the subscription period. Hosted Subscription is a single performance obligation that represents a series of distinct services (daily access to our online portal and related content) that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to our customer. We recognize revenue for Hosted Subscriptions ratably over the subscription period on a straight-line basis as services are performed and continuous access to information in our online portal is provided over the entire term of the agreements. Subscriptions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or annually upon commencement of the subscription period.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n      \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n   \n            Advisory/Consulting Services\n\n\n \n\n\nWe provide certain discrete project based advisory/consulting services, which are recognized over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, based on the input method of consulting hours worked; this aligns with the results achieved and value transferred to our customer. The hours consumed are most reflective of the measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation, as the resources hours worked directly tie to the progress of the services to be provided. In general, they are billed over the course of the project.\n\n\n \n\n\nTransactional Solutions \n\n\n \n\n\nCertain solutions are also paid for by customers on a transactional basis. We recognize these revenues as the solutions are delivered or services performed at a point in time. In general, our customers are billed monthly at the end of each month.\n\n\n \n\n\n(c)    \nDeferred Revenues\n\n\n \n\n\nWe invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, monthly, or milestone installments. Amounts billed and/or collected in advance of services being provided are recorded as “Deferred revenues” and “Other noncurrent liabilities” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are recognized as the services are performed, control is transferred to customers, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria is met.\n\n\n \n\n\n(d)    \nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\n\n \n\n\nAccounts receivable are generally recorded at the invoiced amount. Unbilled receivables are short-term in nature and expected to be billed within \none\n year. The allowance for doubtful accounts or expected credit losses is estimated based on an analysis of the aging of the accounts receivable, historical write-offs, customer payment patterns, individual customer credit worthiness, current economic trends, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and/or establishment of specific reserves for customers in adverse financial condition. We assess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis.\n\n\n \n\n\n(e)    \nDeferred Commissions\n\n\n \n\n\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than \none\n year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, which primarily consist of sales commissions, are deferred and amortized over a useful life of \nfive\n years that is consistent with the transfer to our customer the services to which the asset relates. We classify deferred commissions as current or noncurrent based on the timing of expense recognition. The current and noncurrent portions of deferred commissions are included in \"Prepaid expenses\" and \"Other noncurrent assets\", respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets as of \n December 31, 2024\n. Amortization expense related to deferred commissions is computed on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful lives and included in \"Selling, general and administrative\" within our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(f)    \nFixed Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nFixed assets and finite-lived intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which is computed on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur internal software development costs primarily relate to internal-use software. Such costs are capitalized in the application development stage in accordance with ASC \n350\n-\n40,\n \nInternal-use Software \n(\"ASC \n350\n-\n40\"\n). We account for the cost of software developed for internal use by capitalizing qualifying costs, which are substantially incurred during the application development stage. The amounts capitalized primarily relate to internally developed software used to provide services to customers and are included in fixed assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related product, which is typically \nthree\n years, beginning with the date the software is placed into service. Costs incurred in the preliminary and post-implementation stages of our products are expensed as incurred.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn accordance with ASC \n360,\n \nProperty, Plant & Equipment\n, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets \n may \nnot\n be recoverable, we review our long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by \nfirst\n comparing the carrying value of our assets to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of our assets. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of our assets’ undiscounted cash flows, we estimate and recognize an impairment loss by taking the difference between the carrying value and fair value of our assets. \n\n\n \n\n\n(g)    \nLeases\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have operating and finance leases for corporate offices, data centers, and certain equipment that are accounted for under ASC \n842,\n \nLeases\n. The lease term for our corporate headquarters ends in \n2033\n and includes the options to extend for \none\n \n10\n-year renewal period and \ntwo\n \n5\n-year renewal periods.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. We consider any contract where there is an identified asset and that it has the right to control the use of such asset in determining whether the contract contains a lease. A right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset represents our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As our operating leases do \nnot\n provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available on the adoption date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate was calculated by using our credit rating on our publicly-traded U.S. unsecured bonds and estimating an appropriate credit rating for similar secured debt instruments. Our calculated credit rating on secured debt instruments determined the yield curve used. We calculated an implied spread and applied the spreads to the risk-free interest rates based on the yield of the U.S. Treasury \nzero\n coupon securities with a maturity equal to the remaining lease term in determining the borrowing rates for all operating leases. Our operating lease ROU assets include any lease payments made prior to the rent commencement date and exclude lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease transactions are included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets, net\", and \"Operating lease liabilities\", current and noncurrent, within our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment under \"Fixed assets, net\", \"Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt\", and \"Long-term debt\" within our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(h)    \nFair Value of Financial and Non-financial Instruments\n\n\n \n\n\nWe follow the provisions of ASC \n820\n-\n10,\n \nFair Value Measurements\n (“ASC \n820\n-\n10”\n), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and expands fair value measurement disclosures. We follow the provisions of ASC \n820\n-\n10\n for our financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. We follow the provisions of ASC \n820\n-\n10\n for our non-financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value.\n\n\n \n\n\n(i)    \nForeign Currency\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have determined local currencies are the functional currencies of our foreign operations. The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the period-end rate of exchange and statement of operations items are translated at the average rates prevailing during the year. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive losses” in our accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(j)    \nStock-Based Compensation\n\n\n \n\n\nWe follow ASC \n718,\n \nStock Compensation\n (“ASC \n718”\n). Under ASC \n718,\n stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur nonqualified stock options have an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant date, with a \nten\n-year contractual term. The expected term for our stock options granted for a majority of the awards granted was estimated based on studies of historical experience and projected exercise behavior. However, for certain awards granted, for which \nno\n historical exercise pattern exists, the expected term was estimated using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury \nzero\n coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected term of the equity award. The volatility factor is calculated using our historical daily closing prices over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected term of the stock option awards. The expected dividend yield was based on our expected annual dividend rate on the date of grant.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe fair value of our restricted stock is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Our restricted stock is \nnot\n assignable or transferable until it becomes vested. Restricted stock generally has a service vesting period of \nfour\n years and we recognize the expense ratably over this service vesting period.\n\n\n \n\n\nPerformance share units (“PSU”) vest at the end of a \nthree\n-year performance period, subject to the recipient’s continued service. Each PSU represents the right to receive \none\n share of our common stock and the ultimate realization is based on our achievement of certain market performance criteria. We determined the grant date fair value of PSUs with the assistance of a \nthird\n-party valuation specialist and based on estimates provided by us. The valuation of our PSUs employed the Monte Carlo simulation model, which includes certain key assumptions that were applied to us and our peer group. Those key assumptions included valuation date stock price, expected volatility, correlation coefficients, risk-free rate of return, and expected dividend yield. The valuation date stock price is based on the dividend-adjusted closing price on the grant date. Expected volatility is calculated using historical daily closing prices over a period that is commensurate with the length of the performance period. The correlation coefficients are based on the price data used to calculate the historical volatilities. The risk-free rate of return is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury \nzero\n coupon securities with a maturity equal to the length of the performance period. The expected dividend yield was based on our and our peer group’s expected dividend rate over the performance period. Some of our PSUs are tied to the achievement of certain market performance conditions, namely relative total shareholder return as compared to the S&P \n500\n index (\"TSR-based PSUs\"). Our other PSUs are tied to the achievement of certain financial performance conditions, namely incremental return on invested capital (\"ROIC-based PSUs\").\n\n\n \n\n\nWe estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest. The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate. Estimated forfeiture is ultimately adjusted to actual forfeiture. Changes in the forfeiture assumptions \n may \nimpact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized, as well as the timing of expense recognized over the requisite service period.\n\n\n \n\n\nExcess tax benefit from exercised stock options, lapsing of restricted stock and PSUs is recorded as an income tax benefit in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. This tax benefit is calculated as the excess of the intrinsic value of options exercised and of the market value of restricted stock lapsed over the compensation recognized for financial reporting purposes.\n\n\n \n\n\n(k)    \nResearch and Development Costs\n\n\n \n\n\nResearch and \ndevelopment costs, which are primarily related to personnel and related overhead costs incurred in developing new services for customers, are expensed as incurred. Such costs were $\n35.3\n million, $\n36.8\n million, and $\n43.1\n million for the years ended \n December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and \n2022\n, respectively, and were included in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\n(l)    \nAdvertising Costs\n\n\n \n\n\nAdvertising costs, which are primarily associate\nd with promoting our brand, names and solutions provided, are expensed as incurred. Such costs were $\n9.1\n million, $\n11.9\n million, and $\n14.7\n million for the years ended \n December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and \n2022\n, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\n(m)    \nIncome Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under ASC \n740,\n \nIncome Taxes\n (“ASC \n740”\n), which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeferred tax assets are recorded to the extent these assets are more likely than \nnot\n to be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial operations. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than \nnot\n that all or some of the potential deferred tax assets will \nnot\n be realized.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe follow ASC \n740\n-\n10,\n \nIncome Taxes\n (“ASC \n740\n-\n10”\n)\n,\n which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. ASC \n740\n-\n10\n provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position \n may \nbe recognized based on the technical merits when it is more likely than \nnot\n that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than \nnot\n recognition threshold in accordance with ASC \n740\n-\n10.\n This standard also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within “Other liabilities” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\n \n\n\n(n)    \nEarnings Per Share\n\n\n \n\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) are determined in accordance with ASC \n260,\n \nEarnings per Share\n, which specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for EPS. Basic EPS excludes all dilutive common stock equivalents. It is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS, as calculated using the treasury stock method, reflects the potential dilution that would occur if our dilutive outstanding stock options and stock awards were issued.\n\n\n \n\n\n(o)    \nPension and Postretirement Benefits\n\n\n \n\n\nWe account for our pension and postretirement benefits under ASC \n715,\n \nCompensation — Retirement Benefits\n (“ASC \n715”\n). ASC \n715\n requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet, the recognition in other comprehensive income (loss) of gains or losses and prior service costs arising during the period, but which are \nnot\n included as components of periodic benefit cost or credit, and the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. We utilize a valuation date of \n December \n31.\n\n\n \n\n\n(p)    \nProduct Warranty Obligations\n\n\n \n\n\nWe provide warranty coverage for certain of our solutions. We recognize a product warranty obligation when claims are probable and can be reasonably estimated. As of \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n2023\n, product warranty obligations were \nnot\n material.\n\n\n \n\n\n(q)    \nLoss Contingencies\n\n\n \n\n\nWe accrue for costs relating to litigation, claims, and other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable. Such estimates are based on management’s judgment. Actual amounts paid \n may \ndiffer from amounts estimated, and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into numerous agreements that contain standard indemnities whereby we indemnify another party for breaches of confidentiality, infringement of intellectual property or gross negligence. Such indemnifications are primarily granted under licensing of computer software. Most agreements contain provisions to limit the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnifications; however, we are \nnot\n able to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these indemnifications as the triggering events are \nnot\n subject to predictability.\n\n\n \n\n\n(r)    \nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of our businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are \nnot\n amortized. Intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of \n June \n30,\n or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount \n may \nnot\n be fully recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we \n may \ndecide to \nfirst\n perform a qualitative assessment, or “Step Zero” impairment test, to determine whether it is more likely than \nnot\n that impairment has occurred. The qualitative assessment includes a review of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, internal cost factors, and our own overall financial and share price performance, among other factors. If we do \nnot\n perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is more likely than \nnot\n that the carrying amount of our reporting units exceeds their fair value, we perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(s)    \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n \n\n\n \nAccounting Standard\n \n \nDescription\n \n \nEffective Date\n \n \nEffect on Consolidated Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters\n \n\n\nSegment Reporting (Topic \n280\n) In \n November 2023, \nthe FASB issued Accounting Standards Update \"ASU\" \nNo.\n \n2023\n-\n07,\n Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU \nNo.\n \n2023\n-\n07\"\n)\nThis update changes the reportable segment disclosure requirements requiring enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.

As of \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n2023\n, a vast majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents is with JPMorgan Chase N.A., and TD Bank, N.A.

However, from time to time, these contracts \n may \nbe subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. These performance obligations, which are expected to be satisfied within \none\n year, comprised approximately \n98\n% and \n99\n% of the balance as of \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n2023\n, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe recognize an asset for incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefits of those costs to be longer than \none\n year. As of \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n2023\n, we had deferred commissions of $\n78.5\n million and $\n76.4\n million, respectively, which have been included in \"\nPrepaid expenses\" and \"Other noncurrent assets\" in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n7.\n    Fair Value Measurements:\n\n\n \n\n\nCertain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Such assets and liabilities include amounts for both financial and non-financial instruments. To increase consistency and comparability of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, ASC \n820\n-\n10\n established a \nthree\n-level fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. ASC \n820\n-\n10\n requires disclosures detailing the extent to which companies' measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. In accordance with ASC \n820\n-\n10,\n we applied the following fair value hierarchy:\n\n\n \n\n\nLevel \n1\n — Assets or liabilities for which the identical item is traded on an active exchange, such as publicly-traded instruments.\n\n\n \n\n\nLevel \n2\n — Assets and liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments.\n\n\n \n\n\nLevel \n3\n — Assets or liabilities for which significant valuation assumptions are \nnot\n readily observable in the market; instruments valued based on the best available data, some of which is internally-developed, and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term debt approximate their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instrume\nnts. Our investments in registered investment companies, which are Level \n1\n assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted prices in active markets multiplied by the number of shares owned, were $\n1.2\n million as of \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n2023\n. Our investments in registered investment companies have been included in \"Other current assets\" in our consolidated balance sheets as of \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n2023\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe elected \nnot\n to carry our long-term debt at fair value. The carrying value of our long-term debt represents the amortized cost, inclusive of unamortized premium, and net of unamortized discount and \ndebt issuance costs. We assess the fair value of these financial instruments based on an estimate of interest rates available to us for financial instruments with similar features, our current credit rating, and spreads applicable to us. The following table summarizes the carrying value and estimated fair value of these financial instruments as of \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n2023\n, respectively:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n2023\n \n \n\n\n \n \nFair Value\n \n \n \nCarrying\n \n \n \n \nEstimated\n \n \n \n \nCarrying\n \n \n \n \nEstimated\n \n \n\n\n \n \nHierarchy\n \n \n \nValue\n \n \n \n \nFair Value\n \n \n \n \nValue\n \n \n \n \nFair Value\n \n \n\n\n \nFinancial instrument not carried at fair value:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nSenior Notes (Note 15)\n \n \nLevel 2\n \n \n$\n3,021.0\n \n \n$\n2,866.5\n \n \n$\n2,833.7\n \n \n$\n2,735.3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n2023\n, we had securities without readily determinable market values of $\n195.3\n million and $\n200.9\n million, respectively, which were accounted for at cost.

Rocket’s strong property claims and underwriting technology has been widely adopted by many of the largest insurers and service providers across Germany and Austria. Rocket has become a part of our claims category. The acquisition, which follows a strategic investment by Verisk in Rocket in \n2022,\n will further Verisk's expansion in Europe and the Company’s goal of helping insurers and claims service providers leverage more holistic data and technology tools to enhance the claims experience.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe preliminary allocations of the purchase price for the \n2024\n acquisition with less than a year of ownership is subject to revisions as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The revisions \n may \nhave a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The allocations of the purchase price will be finalized once all the information that was known as of the acquisition date is obtained and analyzed, but \nnot\n to exceed \none\n year from the acquisition date. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are \nnot\n yet finalized relate to income and non-income taxes, deferred revenues, the valuation of intangible assets acquired, and residual goodwill. The goodwill associated with our acquisition includes the acquired assembled workforce, the value associated with the opportunity to leverage the work force to continue to develop the technology and content assets, as well as our ability to grow through adding additional customer relationships or new solutions in the future. The $\n10.6\n million in goodwill associated with our acquisition is \nnot\n deductible for tax purposes. The preliminary amounts assigned to intangible assets by type for this acquisition was based upon our valuation model and historical experiences with entities with similar business characteristics. \n\n\n \n\n\nFor the year ended \n December 31, 2024\n, we incurred transaction costs of $\n0.3\n million. The tra\nnsaction costs were included within \"Selling, general and administrative\" expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. \n\n\n \n\n\nOur \n2024\n acquisition was \nnot\n significant to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended \n December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and \n2022\n,\n and therefore, supplemental information disclosure on an unaudited pro forma basis is \nnot\n presented.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n Acquisitions\n\n\n \n\n\nOn \n April 20, 2023, \nwe acquired Krug Sachverständigen GmbH (\"Krug\") for a net cash purchase price of approximately $\n43.3\n million including working capital adjustments, of which $\n3.8\n million represents indemnity escrows. Krug is a Germany-based motor claims solutions provider and has established an industry-leading position in the German insurance market through highly digitalized solutions that help insurers and car manufacturers achieve better and faster customer service, leading to sustainable reductions in costs. The acquisition expands our claims and casualty offerings across Europe. Krug has become a part of our claims category within our Insurance segment.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn \n February 1, 2023, \nwe acquired \n100\n percent of the stock of Mavera Holding AB (\"Mavera\") for a net cash purchase price of $\n28.3\n million, of which $\n4.2\n million represents indemnity escrows. Mavera, a Sweden-based InsurTech firm with a regional presence and established customer base for its personal injury claims management platform, has become a part of the claims category within our Insurance segment.

When we closed on the sale of our Energy business on \n February 1, 2023, \nwe recognized a loss of $\n128.4\n million. As a result of closing adjustments in the \nsecond\n and \nfourth\n quarter of \n2023,\n we incurred an additional net loss of $\n2.7\n million. \n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table presents the financial results from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our consolidated statement of income for the periods indicated:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n2023\n \n \n \n \n2022\n \n \n\n\n \nRevenues\n \n \n$\n-\n \n \n$\n46.8\n \n \n$\n537.3\n \n\n\n \nOperating expenses:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nCost of revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n18.2\n \n \n \n207.4\n \n\n\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n33.2\n \n \n \n117.2\n \n\n\n \nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n32.9\n \n\n\n \nAmortization of intangible assets\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n68.5\n \n\n\n \nImpairment loss\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n303.7\n \n\n\n \nOther operating loss\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n131.1\n \n \n \n33.9\n \n\n\n \nTotal operating expenses\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n182.5\n \n \n \n763.6\n \n\n\n \nOperating (loss) income\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n(\n135.7\n)\n \n \n(\n226.3\n)\n\n\n \nOther (expense) income:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nInvestment (loss) income and others, net\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n(\n5.7\n)\n \n \n7.0\n \n\n\n \nTotal other (expense) income, net\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n(\n5.7\n)\n \n \n7.0\n \n\n\n \nLoss from discontinued operations before income taxes\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n(\n141.4\n)\n \n \n(\n219.3\n)\n\n\n \nIncome tax benefit (expense)\n \n \n \n6.8\n \n \n \n(\n12.6\n)\n \n \n131.5\n \n\n\n \nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n \n \n$\n6.8\n \n \n$\n(\n154.0\n)\n \n$\n(\n87.8\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe consolidated statements of cash flows have \nnot\n been adjusted to separately disclose cash flows related to discontinued operations.

When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we \n may \ndecide to \nfirst\n perform a qualitative assessment, or \"Step Zero\" impairment test, to determine whether it is more likely than \nnot\n that impairment has occurred. The qualitative assessment includes a review of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, internal cost factors, and our own overall financial and share price performance, among other factors. If we do \nnot\n perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is more likely than \nnot\n that the carrying amount of our reporting units exceeds their fair value, we perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. As of \n June 30, 2024, \nwe completed our Step Zero impairment test at the reporting unit level and determined it was \nnot\n more likely than \nnot\n that the carrying values of our reporting units exceeded their fair values. We did \nnot\n recognize any impairment charges related to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Subsequent to performing the test we continued to monitor these reporting units for events that would trigger an interim impairment test; we did \nnot\n identify any such events.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur intangible assets and related accumulated amortization consisted of the following:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWeighted\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAverage\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nUseful Life\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccumulated\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n(in years)\n \n \n \nCost\n \n \n \n \nAmortization\n \n \n \n \nNet\n \n \n\n\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nTechnology-based\n \n \n8\n \n$\n364.9\n \n \n$\n(\n285.3\n)\n \n$\n79.6\n \n\n\n \nMarketing-related\n \n \n6\n \n \n37.8\n \n \n \n(\n35.5\n)\n \n \n2.3\n \n\n\n \nContract-based\n \n \n6\n \n \n5.0\n \n \n \n(\n5.0\n)\n \n \n-\n \n\n\n \nCustomer-related\n \n \n13\n \n \n529.1\n \n \n \n(\n224.0\n)\n \n \n305.1\n \n\n\n \nDatabase-based\n \n \n8\n \n \n15.1\n \n \n \n(\n9.7\n)\n \n \n5.4\n \n\n\n \nTotal intangible assets\n \n \n \n \n$\n951.9\n \n \n$\n(\n559.5\n)\n \n$\n392.4\n \n\n\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nTechnology-based\n \n \n8\n \n$\n370.2\n \n \n$\n(\n261.2\n)\n \n$\n109.0\n \n\n\n \nMarketing-related\n \n \n6\n \n \n42.7\n \n \n \n(\n38.7\n)\n \n \n4.0\n \n\n\n \nContract-based\n \n \n6\n \n \n5.0\n \n \n \n(\n5.0\n)\n \n \n—\n \n\n\n \nCustomer-related\n \n \n13\n \n \n542.1\n \n \n \n(\n190.7\n)\n \n \n351.4\n \n\n\n \nDatabase-based\n \n \n8\n \n \n15.2\n \n \n \n(\n7.9\n)\n \n \n7.3\n \n\n\n \nTotal intangible assets\n \n \n \n \n$\n975.2\n \n \n$\n(\n503.5\n)\n \n$\n471.7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ended \n December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and \n2022\n wa\ns $\n72.3\n million\n, $\n74.6\n million, and $\n74.4\n million, respectively.

We do \nnot\n rely on these unremitted earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow in the U.S. to fund our U.S. operational and strategic needs.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe follow ASC \n740\n-\n10\n which prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. For each tax position, we must determine whether it is more likely than \nnot\n that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than \nnot\n recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize within the financial statements. \nNo\n benefits \n may \nbe recognized for tax positions that do \nnot\n meet the more likely than \nnot\n threshold. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n2023\n \n \n \n \n2022\n \n \n\n\n \nUnrecognized tax benefit as of January 1\n \n \n$\n2.0\n \n \n$\n3.2\n \n \n$\n3.4\n \n\n\n \nGross increase in tax positions in prior period\n \n \n \n2.3\n \n \n \n0.8\n \n \n \n1.0\n \n\n\n \nGross decrease in tax positions in prior period\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n-\n \n\n\n \nSettlements\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n(\n0.6\n)\n\n\n \nLapse of statute of limitations\n \n \n \n(\n0.2\n)\n \n \n(\n2.0\n)\n \n \n(\n0.6\n)\n\n\n \nUnrecognized tax benefit as of December 31\n \n \n$\n4.1\n \n \n$\n2.0\n \n \n$\n3.2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAll unrecognized tax benefits as of \n December 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n, and\n \n2022\n would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate if recognized in any future periods. \n\n\n \n\n\nThe total gross amount of accrued interest and penalties for the years ended \n December 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n was $\n0.7\n million, $\n0.2\n million, and $\n0.4\n million, respectively. Our practice is to recognize interest and penalties associated with income taxes as a component of “Provision for income taxes” in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe do \nnot\n expect a significant change in unrecognized benefits related to federal, state, or foreign tax exposures within the coming year. In addition, we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately $\n0.9\n million of our currently remaining unrecognized tax positions, each of which is individually insignific\nant, \n may \nbe recognized by the end of \n2024\n as a result of a combination of audit settlements and lapses of statute of limitations, net of additional uncertain tax positions.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are subject to tax in the U.S., various state, and foreign jurisdictions, and are routinely under audit by various tax authorities. With few exceptions, we are \nno\n longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-US income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before \n2020\n.\n We do \nnot\n expect the results of current examinations to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flow.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n14.\n    Composition of Certain Financial Statement Caption:\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table presents the components of “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” as of \n December \n31:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n2023\n \n \n\n\n \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nAccrued salaries, benefits and other related costs\n \n \n$\n143.6\n \n \n$\n149.4\n \n\n\n \nEscrow liabilities\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n3.9\n \n\n\n \nAccrued interest\n \n \n \n20.7\n \n \n \n19.1\n \n\n\n \nTrade accounts payable and other accrued expenses\n \n \n \n85.5\n \n \n \n158.4\n \n\n\n \nAcquisition-related liabilities\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n10.0\n \n\n\n \nTotal accounts payable and accrued liabilities\n \n \n$\n249.8\n \n \n$\n340.8\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table presents the components of \"Other noncurrent assets\" as of \n December 31:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n2023\n \n \n\n\n \nOther noncurrent assets:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nPension benefits\n \n \n$\n125.3\n \n \n$\n121.4\n \n\n\n \nOther assets - prepaid expenses\n \n \n \n87.6\n \n \n \n73.2\n \n\n\n \nInvestments in nonpublic companies\n \n \n \n222.2\n \n \n \n231.4\n \n\n\n \nState income tax receivable\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n67.7\n \n\n\n \nDeposits and other\n \n \n \n2.8\n \n \n \n2.4\n \n\n\n \nTotal other noncurrent assets\n \n \n$\n437.9\n \n \n$\n496.1\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n15.\n    Debt:\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table presents short-term and long-term debt by issuance as of \n December \n31:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \nIssuance\n \n \n \nMaturity\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nDate\n \n \n \nDate\n \n \n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n2023\n \n \n\n\n \nShort-term debt and current portion of long-term debt:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nCredit Facilities:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nSyndicated revolving credit facility\n \n \nVarious\n \n \n \nVarious\n \n \n$\n-\n \n \n$\n-\n \n\n\n \nSenior Notes:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n4.000\n% senior notes, less unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $(\n0.3\n)\n \n \n5/15/2015\n \n \n \n6/15/2025\n \n \n$\n499.7\n \n \n$\n-\n \n\n\n \nFinance lease liabilities\n (1)\n \n \nVarious\n \n \n \nVarious\n \n \n \n14.5\n \n \n \n14.5\n \n\n\n \nShort-term debt and current portion of long-term debt\n \n \n \n514.2\n \n \n \n14.5\n \n\n\n \nLong-term debt:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nSenior notes:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n4.000\n% senior notes, less unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $(\n1.8\n)\n \n \n5/15/2015\n \n \n \n6/15/2025\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n898.2\n \n\n\n \n4.125\n% senior notes, inclusive of unamortized premium, and net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $\n6.3\n and $\n7.8\n, respectively\n \n \n3/6/2019\n \n \n \n3/15/2029\n \n \n \n606.3\n \n \n \n607.8\n \n\n\n \n5.500\n% senior notes, less unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $(\n3.7\n) and $(\n3.8\n), respectively\n \n \n5/15/2015\n \n \n \n6/15/2045\n \n \n \n346.3\n \n \n \n346.2\n \n\n\n \n3.625\n% senior notes, less unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $(\n9.2\n) and $(\n9.6\n), respectively\n \n \n5/13/2020\n \n \n \n5/15/2050\n \n \n \n490.8\n \n \n \n490.4\n \n\n\n \n5.750\n% senior notes, less unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $(\n7.9\n) and $(\n8.9\n), respectively\n \n \n3/3/2023\n \n \n \n4/1/2033\n \n \n \n492.1\n \n \n \n491.1\n \n\n\n \n5.250\n% senior notes, less unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $(\n14.2\n)\n \n \n6/5/2024\n \n \n \n6/5/2034\n \n \n \n585.8\n \n \n \n-\n \n\n\n \nFinance lease liabilities \n(1)\n \n \nVarious\n \n \n \nVarious\n \n \n \n26.9\n \n \n \n20.0\n \n\n\n \nSyndicated revolving credit facility debt issuance costs\n \n \nVarious\n \n \n \nVarious\n \n \n \n(\n1.3\n)\n \n \n(\n1.5\n)\n\n\n \nLong-term debt\n \n \n \n2,546.9\n \n \n \n2,852.2\n \n\n\n \nTotal debt\n \n \n$\n3,061.1\n \n \n$\n2,866.7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________\n\n\n(\n1\n) \nRefer to \nNote \n8\n.

The KSOP includes both an employee savings component and an employee stock ownership component. The purpose of the combined plan is to enable our employees to participate in a tax-deferred savings arrangement under Internal Revenue Servic\ne Code Sections \n401\n(a) and \n401\n(k) (the “Code”), and to provide our employees equity participation through the employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) accounts.\n\n\n \n\n\nUnder the KSOP, eligible employees \n may \nmake pre-tax and after-tax cash contributions as a percentage of their compensation, subject to certain limitations under the applicable provisions of the Code. The maximum pre-tax contribution that can be made to the \n401\n(k) account as determined under the provisions of Code Section \n401\n(g) is $\n23.0\n thousand for \n2024\n, $\n22.5\n thousand for \n2023\n and $\n20.5\n thousand for \n2022\n. Certain eligible participants (age \n50\n and older) \n may \ncontribute an additional $\n7.5\n thousand for \n2024\n and \n2023\n, and $\n6.5\n thousand for \n2022\n.After-tax contributions are limited to \n10.0\n% of a participant’s compensation. Effective \n January 1, 2019, \nwe increased the matching contributions to \n100.0\n% of the \nfirst\n \n6.0\n% of the participant’s contribution. The \n401\n(k) matching contributions under the KSOP for the years ended \n December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and \n2022\n, were $\n33.8\n million, $\n32.4\n million, and $\n40.0\n million, respectively; which, at our option, were funded in cash.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn \n2005,\n we established the ISO Profit Sharing Plan (the “Profit Sharing Plan”), a defined contribution plan, to replace the qualified pension plan for all eligible employees hired on or after \n March \n1,\n \n2005.\n The Profit Sharing Plan is a component of the KSOP. Eligible employees participated in the Profit Sharing Plan if they completed \n1,000\n hours of service each plan year and were employed on \n December \n31\n of that year. We can make a discretionary contribution to the Profit Sharing Plan based on our annual performance. Participants vest once they have completed \nfour\n years and \n1,000\n hours of service. For the years ended \n December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and \n2022\n, there were \nno\n profit sharing contributions.\n\n\n \n\n\nEquity Compensation Plans\n\n\n \n\n\nAll of our outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, deferred stock units, and PSUs are covered under our \n2021\n Incentive Plan, or our \n2013\n Incentive Plan. Awards under our \n2021\n Incentive Plan \n may \ninclude \none\n or more of the following types: (i) stock options (both nonqualified and incentive stock options), (ii) stock appreciation rights, (iii) restricted stock, (iv) restricted stock units, (v) performance awards, (vi) other share-based awards and (vii) cash. Employees, non-employee directors, and consultants are eligible for awards under our \n2021\n Incentive Plan. We transferred common stock under these plans from our treasury shares. \nAs of \n December 31, 2024\n, there were \n12,813,327\n shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our \n2021\n Incentive Plan. Cash received from stock option exercises for the years ended \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n December 31, 2023\n was $\n124.8\n million and $\n141.9\n million, respectively. We issued common stock under these plans from our treasury shares. We have granted equity awards to key employees and directors. The ultimate realization of the PSUs \n may \nrange from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the recipient’s target levels established on the grant date. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

our common stock as of the reporting date. Excess tax benefits of $\n27.3\n million, $\n20.6\n million, and $\n26.5\n million from exercised stock options were recorded as income tax benefit in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended \n December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and \n2022\n, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended \n December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and \n2022\n was $\n47.9\n million, $\n54.0\n million, and $\n56.5\n million, respectively. \nAs of \n December 31, 2024\n, the weighted average remaining contractual terms were \n5.5\n and \n4.5\n years for outstanding and exercisable stock options, respectively. \nAs of \n December 31, 2023\n, the weighted average remaining contractual terms were \n5.6\n years and \n4.8\n years for outstanding and exercisable stock options, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of \n December 31, 2024\n, there was $\n75.1\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost, exclusive of the impact of vesting upon retirement eligibility, related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under our \n2021\n and \n2013\n Incentive Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n2.26\n years.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur U.K. Sharesave Plan offers qualifying employees in the United Kingdom the opportunity to own shares of our common stock. Employees who elect to participate are granted stock options, of which the exercise price is equal to the average of the closing price on the \nfive\n trading days immediately preceding the plan invitation date discounted by \n5\n%, and enter into a savings contract, the proceeds of which are then used to exercise the options upon the \nthree\n-year maturity of the savings contract. During the years ended \n December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and \n2022\n, we granted \n3,268\n, \n5,144\n, and \n9,370\n stock options under the U.K. Sharesave Plan at a discounted exercise price of $\n257.05\n, $\n227.65\n, and $\n178.26\n, respectively. As of \n December 31, 2024\n, there were \n442,363\n shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our U.K. Sharesave Plan.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also offer eligible employees the opportunity to participate in an ESPP. Under our ESPP, participating employees \n may \nauthorize payroll deductions of up to \n20.0\n% of their regular base salary and up to \n50.0\n% of their short-term incentive compensation, both of which in total \n may \nnot\n exceed $\n25.0\n thousand in any calendar year, to purchase shares of our common stock at a \n5.0\n% discount of its fair market value at the time of purchase. In accordance with ASC \n718,\n our ESPP is noncompensatory as the purchase discount is \n5.0\n% or less from the fair market value, substantially all employees that meet limited employment qualifications \n may \nparticipate, and it incorporates \nno\n option features. During the years ended \n December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and \n2022\n, we issued \n16,964\n, \n18,636\n, and \n30,398\n shares of common stock at a weighted average discounted price of $\n247.44\n, $\n209.68\n, and $\n174.66\n, respectively. As of \n December 31, 2024\n, there were \n1,160,295\n shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our ESPP.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n18.\n    Pension and Postretirement Benefits:\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have a frozen qualified defined benefit pension plan for certain of our employees through membership in the Pension Plan for Insurance Organizations (the “Pension Plan”), a multiple-employer trust. Prior to the freeze, we applied a cash balance formula to determine future benefits. Under the cash balance formula, each participant has an account, which was credited annually based on salary rates determined by years of service, as well as the interest earned on the previous year-end cash balance. We also have a non-qualified frozen supplemental cash balance plan (“SERP”) for certain employees. Our SER\nP is funded from our general assets. We contributed $\n0.7\n million to our SERP in \n2024\n and $\n1.7\n million in \n2023\n, respectively, and expect to contribute $\n0.8\n million in \n2025.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Pension Plan’s funding policy is to contribute annually at an amount between the minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n1974\n and the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. \nNo\n minimum contribution requirement was and is expecte\nd for \n2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively. \n\n\n \n\n\nWe also provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for both active and retired employees. The Postretirement Health and Life Insurance Plan (the “Postretirement Plan”), which has been frozen, is contributory, requiring participants to pay a stated percentage of the premium for coverage. We do \nnot\n expect to contribute to our Postretirement Plan in \n2025.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the benefit obligations and the plan assets, the funded status of the

During the \nfirst\n quarter of \n2024\n and as of \n December 31, 2023, \nthe investment guidelines on our Pension Plan assets had targeted an investment allocation of \n40\n% to equity securities and \n60\n% to debt securities. Our Pension Plan assets consist primarily of investments in various fixed income and equity funds. Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager. These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Investment managers are prohibited from entering into any speculative hedging transactions. The investment objective is to achieve a maximum total return with strong emphasis on preservation of capital in re\nal terms.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe asset allocatio\nn at \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n2023\n, and target allo\ncation by asset category are as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTarget\n \n \n \n \nPercentage of Plan Assets\n \n \n\n\n \nAsset Category\n \n \n \nAllocation\n \n \n \n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n2023\n \n \n\n\n \nEquity securities\n \n \n \n40.0\n%\n \n \n36.5\n%\n \n \n40.0\n%\n\n\n \nDebt securities\n \n \n \n60.0\n \n \n \n57.5\n \n \n \n53.5\n \n\n\n \nReal Estate\n \n \n \n—\n \n \n \n4.9\n \n \n \n5.3\n \n\n\n \nOther\n \n \n \n—\n \n \n \n1.1\n \n \n \n1.2\n \n\n\n \nTotal\n \n \n \n100.0\n%\n \n \n100.0\n%\n \n \n100.0\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have used the target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan. The expected return for each investment category within the target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of our Pension Plan. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs. We believe that the use of the average historical rates of returns is consistent with the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. These considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also maintain a voluntary employees beneficiary association plan (the “VEBA Plan”) under Section \n501\n(c)(\n9\n) of the Internal Revenue Code to fund the Postretirement Plan.

ASC \n280\n-\n10\n requires that a public business enterprise reports financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our President and CEO is identified as the CODM as defined by ASC \n280\n-\n10.\n\n\n \n\n\nEach of our reportable segments, Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets, and Financial Services has a portion of its revenue from more than \none\n of the \nthree\n revenue types described within the revenue recognition policy within \nNote \n2\n. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Below is the overview of the solutions offered within each reportable segment.\n\n\n \n\n\nInsurance:\n We are the leading provider of statistical, actuarial, and underwriting data for the U.S. P&C insurance industry. Our databases include cleansed and standardized records describing premiums and losses in insurance transactions, casualty and property risk attributes for commercial buildings and their occupants, and fire suppression capabilities of municipalities. We use this data to create policy language and proprietary risk classifications that are industry standards and to generate prospective loss cost estimates used to price insurance policies, which are accessed via a hosted platform. We also develop solutions that our customers use to analyze key processes in managing risk. Our combination of algorithms and analytic methods incorporates our proprietary data to generate solutions. We also help businesses and governments better anticipate and manage climate and weather-related risks. In most cases, our customers integrate the solutions into their models, formulas or underwriting criteria in order to predict potential loss events, ranging from hurricanes to earthquakes. We develop catastrophe and extreme event models and offer solutions covering natural and man-made risks, including acts of terrorism. We further develop solutions that allow customers to quantify costs after loss events occur. Our multitier, multispectral terrestrial imagery and data acquisition, processing, analytics, and distribution system using the remote sensing and machine learning technologies help gather, store, process, and deliver geographic and spatially referenced information that supports uses in many markets. Additionally, we offer fraud-detection solutions including review of data on claim histories, analysis of claims to find emerging patterns of fraud, and identification of suspicious claims in the insurance sector. Our underwriting, insurance anti-fraud claims, catastrophe modeling, and loss quantification are included in this segment.\n\n\n \n\n\nEnergy and Specialized Markets: \nIn the \nfirst\n quarter of \n2022\n,\n the sale of \n3E\n (which comprised of our Specialized Market) was completed. On \n February 1, 2023, \nwe completed the sale of our Energy segment. We determined that the transaction met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, the financial operations of Energy are excluded from the segment disclosure. See \nNote \n11.\n Dispositions and Discontinued Operations for further discussion. Prior to the sale, we were a leading provider of data analytics via hosted platform for the global energy, chemicals, and metals and mining industries. Our research and consulting solutions focused on exploration strategies and screening, asset development and acquisition, commodity markets, and corporate analysis in the areas of business environment, business improvement, business strategies, commercial advisory, and transaction support. We gathered and managed proprietary information, insight, and analysis on oil and gas fields, mines, refineries, and other assets across the interconnected global energy sectors to advise customers in making asset investment and portfolio allocation decisions. Our analytical tools measured and observed environmental properties and translated those measurements into actionable information based on customer needs. In addition, we provided market and cost intelligence to energy companies to optimize financial results. We further offered a suite of data and information services that enable improved compliance with global Environmental Health and Safety requirements related to the safe manufacturing, distribution, transportation, usage, and disposal of chemicals and products. \n\n\n \n\n\nFinancial Services: \nOn \n April 8, 2022, \nthe sale of this segment was completed. See \nNote \n11.\n Dispositions and Discontinued Operations for further discussion. Prior to the sale, we maintained a bank account consortia to provide competitive benchmarking, decisioning algorithms, business intelligence, and customized analytic services that help financial institutions, payment networks and processors, alternative lenders, regulators, and merchants make better strategy, marketing, and risk decisions. Customers applied our solutions in the areas of tailored data management and media effectiveness that include business intelligence platforms, profile views, mobile data solutions, enterprise database services, and fraud risk scoring algorithms for marketing, fraud, and risk mitigation. \n\n\n \n\n\nThe CODM uses EBITDA and consolidated net income to set budgets, evaluate margins, review actual results and in deciding whether to reinvest profits into the business, pursue acquisitions, pay dividends and/or engage in other capital management transactions. Consolidated net income is the measure of segment profit most consistent with U.S. GAAP that is regularly reviewed by the CODM to allocate resources and assess performance. For the year ended \n December 31, 2024 \nand \n December 31, 2023 \nresults, please refer to the Consolidated Statements of Income for information regarding revenues, expenses, and the measure of profit and loss, which is net income.

With respect to Ongoing Matters, we are unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to Ongoing Matters or the impact these matters \n may \nhave on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Although we believe we have strong defenses and have appealed adverse rulings to us, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n\n \n\n\nTelematics Litigation\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of \n April 19, 2024, \nvarious Plaintiffs filed a total of \ntwenty\n separate putative class action lawsuits, \nsixteen\n against General Motors LLC (“GM”), OnStar LLC (“OnStar”), LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Inc. (“LexisNexis”) and Verisk Analytics Inc. in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Georgia, the Eastern District of Michigan, Central District of California, District of New Jersey, Southern District of New York, Northern District of Alabama, Northern District of Illinois and District of South Carolina, and \nfour\n against Hyundai Motor America (“Hyundai”) and Verisk in the Central District of California and District of New Jersey, all of which have been dismissed to date. The Complaints generally allege that the auto manufacturer Defendants collected consumers’ driver behavior data through vehicle software, transmitted it to LexisNexis and Verisk, and that LexisNexis and Verisk shared the data with auto insurance companies, without the individuals’ knowledge or consent. Plaintiffs seek certification of both nationwide classes of individuals and subclasses of various state residents who had their vehicle’s driving data collected by Defendants and shared with a \nthird\n party without their consent. The Plaintiffs also seek actual, statutory and punitive damages, injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and other costs. On \n June 7, \nthe Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred all GM-related lawsuits to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (In Re: Consumer Vehicle Driving Data Tracking Litigation, MDL Case \nNo.\n \n1:24\n-md-\n03115\n-TWT\n)\n. All discovery proceedings have been stayed. The matters pending against Verisk in the MDL were voluntarily dismissed on \n December 13, 2024, \nand a new putative class action, \nAdam Dinitz, et al. v. Verisk Analytics, Inc. \n(“\nDinitz\n”), was filed in the District of New Jersey federal court, Case \nNo.\n \n24\n-\n11157,\n to include those dismissed matters and additional named Plaintiffs. \nDinitz\n was transferred to the Northern District of Georgia to be part of the consolidated MDL. A related amended Master Consolidated class action Complaint was also filed in the MDL on \n December 13, 2024. \nAt this time, it is \nnot\n possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to these and other associated matters, as they are still in their early stages.\n\n\n \n\n\nIndemnification Claim\n\n\n \n\n\nIn \n December 2023, \nwe received a Notice of Indemnification claim from the current owner of our former healthcare data analytics subsidiary, which was divested in \n2016,\n relating to an ongoing tax investigation by the Nepalese tax authorities. Pursuant to the \n2016\n sale agreement, we are subject to indemnification obligations with respect to certain pre-closing tax liabilities of the divested entity. At this time, it is \nnot\n possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as it is still in its early stages.\n\n\n \n\n\nCommercial Litigation\n\n\n \n\n\nOn \n February 12, 2024, \nPlaintiffs filed a lawsuit, DDS Striker Holdings LLC and Data Driven Holdings LLC against Verisk Analytics, Inc. and Insurance Service Office, in the Superior Court of Delaware, Case \nNo.\n \nN24C\n-\n02\n-\n130\n VLM CCLD. Plaintiffs allege claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent inducement, common law fraud, and civil conspiracy in connection with their inability to meet the post-closing earn-out targets negotiated as part of our acquisition of Data Driven Safety, LLC. Plaintiffs seek rescissory, out-of-pocket and punitive damages, as well as attorney’s fees, costs and other expenses. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims, which was fully briefed as of \n June 21, 2024, \nand was partially denied on \n August 29, 2024. \nDiscovery is ongoing. At this time, it is \nnot\n possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nData Privacy Litigation\n\n\n \n\n\nOn or about \n February 8, 2023, \nPlaintiffs filed a lawsuit, Atlas Data Privacy Corp., et al. v. Verisk Analytics, Inc., et al., in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County, Case \nNo.\n MID-L-\n000903\n-\n24,\n alleging violations of Daniel’s Law. Atlas claims to be an “assignee” of claims of approximately \n19,640\n individuals who are “covered persons” under Daniel’s Law, allegedly enacted to provide judicial and law enforcement officers and their family members with the right to prevent disclosure of their personal information and to enforce those rights against uncooperative data brokers. It is alleged that Defendants have violated Daniel’s Law by failing to respond and comply with their written request to Defendants to cease publicly disclosing or re-disclosing their protected information. Plaintiffs seek actual damages in the amount of $\n1,000\n per violation under the statute, punitive damages, injunctive relief ordering compliance with Daniel’s Law, permanent injunctive relief, including the appointment of a qualified independent expert to ensure compliance with Daniel’s Law, and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. On \n June 21, 2024, \nthe court issued a “lack of prosecution” warning to Atlas, advising that the case will be dismissed without prejudice if service is \nnot\n effectuated by \n August 20, 2024. \nThe case was dismissed without prejudice on \n August 26, 2024. \nOn \n October 11, 2024, \nPlaintiffs served Verisk with the Summons and Complaint, indicating their intent to revise the lawsuit. At this time, it is \nnot\n possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn \n January 30, 2023, \nPlaintiffs Justin Ahringer and Michael Donner filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court, Central District of California, titled Ahringer et al. v. LoanDepot, Inc. and Verisk Analytics, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya, Case \nNo.:\n \n8:23\n-cv-\n00186.\n Plaintiffs assert violations of California’s Invasion of Privacy Act, Unfair Competition Law, and a violation of class members’ privacy rights under the California Constitution. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants recorded visitors’ electronic communications without their consent. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide class of individuals who visited LoanDepot.com and provided personal information on the website’s forms to receive a quote or apply for a loan. They allege that the aggregate claims of all members of the proposed class exceeds $\n5.0\n million. Plaintiffs seek compensatory, statutory or punitive damages or restitution, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and other costs. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims on \n April 13, 2023. \nThe parties engaged in jurisdictional discovery in response to the court’s demand to Plaintiff to demonstrate why this case should \nnot\n be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court found jurisdiction is proper and partially denied our motion on \n February 7, 2024. \nWe filed our Answer to Plaintiffs' Complaint on \n February 22, 2024. \nThe parties agreed to a settlement. The court granted the Parties' joint stipulation of dismissal, thereby dismissing all claims in the case. The case has been marked closed.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn \n June 27, 2022, \nPlaintiff Loretta Williams brought a putative class action against Lead Intelligence, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya (“we,” “our,” or “us”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, titled Williams v. DDR Media, LLC and Lead Intelligence, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya, Civil Action \nNo.\n \n3:22\n-cv-\n03789.\n The Complaint alleges that the Defendants violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal. Penal Code \n631\n (“CIPA”) and invaded Plaintiff’s and class members’ privacy rights when Defendants purportedly recorded visitors’ visits to the \nscrappyrent2own.com\n website without prior express consent. It is further alleged that this conduct constitutes a violation of the California Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. Prof. Code Section \n17200\n et seq. and the California Constitution. The Complaint seeks class certification, injunctive relief, statutory damages in the amount of $\n5,000\n for each violation, attorneys fees and other litigation costs. Our motion to compel arbitration was fully briefed as of \n January 27, 2023. \nIt was denied on \n February 28, 2023. \nWe filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims on \n April 13, 2023. \nOn \n August 18, 2023 \nthe court granted our motion, dismissing Plaintiff’s claims without prejudice, but giving Plaintiff an opportunity to amend her claims by \n September 20, 2023. \nPlaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on \n September 20, 2023. \nOur motion to dismiss the SAC was fully briefed on \n December 18, 2023. \nIt was denied on \n January 30, 2024. \nThe court held an initial case management conference for \n February 9, 2024 \nand allowed the parties to engage in limited discovery. Our motion for summary judgment was filed on \n July 19, 2024 \nand oral argument was held on \n September 20, 2024. \nOn \n November 20, 2024, \nthe Court granted our motion for summary judgment. The case has been marked closed.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn \n December 15, 2021, \nPlaintiff Jillian Cantinieri brought a putative class action against Verisk Analytics, Insurance Services Office and ISO Claims Services, Inc.

Verisk Analytics Inc., et al., Civil Action \nNo.\n \n2:21\n-cv-\n6911.\n The Complaint alleges that we failed to safeguard the personally identifiable information (PII) of Plaintiff and the members of the proposed classes from a purported breach of our databases by unauthorized entities. Plaintiff and class members allege actual and imminent injuries, including theft of their PII, fraudulent activity on their financial accounts, lowered credit scores, and costs associated with detection and prevention of identity theft and fraud. They seek to recover compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, disgorgement of earnings and profits, and attorney’s fees and costs. We filed our motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims on \n April 22, 2022. \nOn \n March 30, 2023, \nthe court denied our motion to dismiss without prejudice, allowing us an opportunity to re-file the motion once limited jurisdictional discovery has been completed. Our renewed motion to dismiss was fully briefed on \n February 16, 2024. \nOn \n December 23, 2024, \nthe Court granted our motion to dismiss.
