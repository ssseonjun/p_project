There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our Notes (defined below) and to service, extend or refinance our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\n\n \n\n\nRestricted Cash\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 29, 2024, we had $144.0 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $51.2 million of restricted cash equivalents held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $195.4 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of December 29, 2024, we also held $80.9 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n45\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLong-Term Debt\n\n\n \n\n\n2022 Variable Funding Notes\n\n\n \n\n\nOn September 16, 2022, certain of our subsidiaries issued a variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $120.0 million of Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes (the “2022 Variable Funding Notes”). Additional information related to our 2022 Variable Funding Notes is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n\n2021 Variable Funding Notes\n\n\n \n\n\nIn connection with the 2021 Recapitalization, certain of our subsidiaries issued a variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”). Additional information related to our 2021 Variable Funding Notes is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n\n2021 Recapitalization\n\n\n \n\n\nOn April 16, 2021, we completed the 2021 Recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization.

Gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 Notes were $1.9 billion. The 2017 Floating Rate Notes and the 2017 Five-Year Notes were repaid in connection with the 2021 Recapitalization. Additional information related to the 2017 Recapitalization is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n46\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2015 Recapitalization\n\n\n \n\n\nOn October 21, 2015, we completed the 2015 Recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. The notes consisted of $500.0 million of Series 2015-1 3.484% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “2015 Five-Year Notes”), $800.0 million Series 2015-1 4.474% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “2015 Ten-Year Notes” and collectively with the 2015 Five-Year Notes, the “2015 Notes”). Gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2015 Notes were $1.3 billion. The 2015 Five-Year Notes were repaid in connection with the 2018 Recapitalization. Additional information related to the 2015 Recapitalization is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 Notes\n\n\n \n\n\nThe 2021 Notes, 2019 Notes, 2018 Notes, 2017 Notes and the 2015 Notes are collectively referred to as the “Notes.”\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe Notes have original scheduled principal payments of $1.18 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $817.9 million in 2028, $631.0 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $912.5 million in 2031. However, in accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our Holdco Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, each as defined in the indenture governing our securitized debt, and no catch-up provisions are applicable.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of the end of each of the fiscal quarters in 2024, we had a Holdco Leverage Ratio of less than 5.0x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payments for our outstanding notes beginning in the second quarter of 2024. Accordingly, the outstanding principal amounts of our 2021 Notes, 2019 Notes, 2018 9.25-Year Notes and 2017 Ten-Year Notes have been classified as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe anticipated repayment date for each of the 2018 7.5-Year Notes and the 2015 Ten-Year Notes is October 2025 and accordingly, the outstanding principal amounts for these notes have been classified as current portion of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2024. We expect to refinance the 2018 7.5-Year Notes and the 2015 Ten-Year Notes prior to the anticipated repayment date. If we do not refinance the 2018 7.5-Year Notes and the 2015 Ten-Year Notes prior to the anticipated repayment date, additional interest of at least 5% per annum will accrue and our cash flows other than technology fees and a weekly management fee to cover certain general and administrative expenses would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. The covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of 1.75x total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the indenture governing our securitized debt. In the event that certain covenants are not met, the Notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLeases\n\n\n \n\n\nWe lease certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles, various equipment and our World Resource Center under leases with expiration dates through 2045. Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our leases, including future minimum rental commitments.\n \n\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the past three years, we have spent approximately $305.5 million on capital expenditures. In 2024, we spent $112.9 million on capital expenditures which primarily related to investments in our technology initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 29, 2024.\n\n\nInvestments\n\n\n \n\n\nWe hold a non-controlling interest in DPC Dash, our master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our investment in DPC Dash was $82.7 million and $143.6 million, respectively. The fair value of our investment in DPC Dash was based on the active exchange quoted price for the equity security of HK$79.25 per share as of December 29, 2024 and HK$61.95 per share as of December 31, 2023. We owned 8,101,019 and 18,101,019 ordinary shares as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We sold 10,000,000 ordinary shares of our investment in DPC Dash in the fourth quarter of 2024 for net proceeds of $82.9 million. We recorded a total net adjustment to the net carrying amount of our investment in DPC Dash of $22.1 million and $17.7 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the net realized and unrealized gains recorded in other income in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n\n \n47\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nShare Repurchase Programs\n\n\n \n\n\nOur share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. We used cash of $327.0 million in 2024, $269.0 million in 2023 and $293.7 million in 2022 for share repurchases.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOn February 21, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized an additional share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock, in addition to the $141.3 million that was previously remaining under our previous July 20, 2021 authorization for a total authorization of $1.14 billion for future share repurchases as of that date. As of December 29, 2024, we had $814.3 million remaining under this authorization for repurchases of shares of our common stock.\n\n\n \n\n\nDividends\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe declared dividends of $210.7 million (or $6.04 per share) in 2024, $170.4 million (or $4.84 per share) in 2023 and $157.5 million (or $4.40 per share) in 2022. We paid dividends of $209.9 million, $169.8 million and $157.5 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nSubsequent to the end of fiscal 2024, on February 19, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.74 per common share payable on March 28, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2025.\n\n\n \n\n\nSources and Uses of Cash\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFiscal Year Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 29, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash flows provided by (used in):\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n624.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n590.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(31.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(106.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(532.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(476.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n59.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOperating Activities\n\n\n \n\n\nCash provided by operating activities increased $34.0 million in 2024 primarily as a result of higher net income, excluding non-cash operating activities and a positive change in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted. Net income increased $65.1 million and non-cash adjustments increased $17.5 million, resulting in an overall increase to cash provided by operating activities in 2024 as compared to 2023 of $82.6 million. Additionally, a $45.8 million positive impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in 2024 as compared to 2023 was a result of receipts for advertising contributions outpacing payments for advertising activities. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities totaling $94.4 million, primarily related to the timing of payments on accrued liabilities, income taxes and accounts payable in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nInvesting Activities\n\n\n \n\n\nCash used in investing activities was $31.2 million in 2024, which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $112.9 million (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations). These investing cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of 10,000,000 ordinary shares of our investment in DPC Dash for $82.9 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nCash used in investing activities was $106.9 million in 2023, which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $105.4 million (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations).\n\n\n \n48\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFinancing Activities\n\n\n \n\n\nCash used in financing activities was $532.2 million in 2024. We repurchased and retired $327.0 million in shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, as well as made $2.6 million in excise tax payments related to our share repurchase programs. We also made dividend payments to our shareholders of $209.9 million. We made repayments of long-term debt and principal amounts related to our financing obligations and finance leases of $17.6 million and had tax payments for the vesting of restricted stock of $11.1 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $36.0 million.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCash used in financing activities was $476.4 million in 2023. We repurchased and retired $269.0 million in shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, and we also made dividend payments to our shareholders of $169.8 million. We also made repayments of long-term debt and principal amounts related to our financing obligations and finance leases of $55.7 million and had tax payments for the vesting of restricted stock of $5.4 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from our failed sale leaseback transaction of $14.9 million and from the exercise of stock options of $8.7 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nImpact of Inflation\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGiven the inflation rates in recent years, there have been and may continue to be increases in food costs and labor costs which have and could further impact our profitability and that of our franchisees and which could impact the opening of new U.S. and international franchised stores and adversely affect our operating results. Factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee health and benefit costs, increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs and profitability and those of our franchisees and could result in menu price increases. The impact of inflation is described with respect to our food basket pricing to stores and our labor cost, in the discussion of supply chain revenues and U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain gross margins, above. Severe increases in inflation could affect the global and U.S. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above, as well as in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n49\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThis Form 10-K includes various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Qua\nntitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\n\n \n\n\nMarket risk\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe do not engage in speculative transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into variable funding notes, and, at December 29, 2024, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes. As of December 29, 2024, we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOur 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”), plus a spread adjustment. Accordingly, a rising interest rate environment could result in higher interest expense due on borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur fixed-rate debt exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. As of December 29, 2024, we had approximately $1.14 billion of debt classified as current associated with our 2018 7.5-Year Notes and 2015 Ten-Year Notes for which the anticipated repayment date is October 2025. We expect to refinance the 2018 7.5-Year Notes and 2015 Ten-Year Notes prior to the anticipated repayment date, and we expect, based upon current benchmark rates, to refinance those notes at higher interest rates.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are exposed to market risks from changes in food and commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. Severe increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflation, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could also adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk, although we have not done so historically. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases.\n\n\n \n\n\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.8% of our total revenues in 2024, 6.9% of our total revenues in 2023 and 6.5% of our total revenues in 2022 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international franchise royalty and fee revenues of approximately $28.2 million in 2024.\n\n\n \n52\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nItem 8. Financial S\ntatements and Supplementary Data.\n\n\n \n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\n \n\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Domino’s Pizza, Inc.\n\n\n \n\n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Domino’s Pizza, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ deficit and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of condensed financial information listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the COSO.\n\n\n \n\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n53\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\n \n\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n \n\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n\n \n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\n \n\n\nValuation of Casualty Insurance Reserves\n\n\n \n\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has retention programs for workers’ compensation, general liability, and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities for certain periods prior to December 1998 and for periods after December 2001. As of December 29, 2024, the Company had accruals for these casualty insurance matters of $50.7 million. The casualty insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates, which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events. Management utilizes various methods, including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported. The actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. When estimating these liabilities, several factors are considered, including the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal cost associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of casualty insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated reserves; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures relating to the actuarial valuation methods used to develop future ultimate claim costs and actuarial assumptions related to the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal cost associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n\n \n\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of casualty insurance reserves. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the Company’s casualty insurance program documents and testing the underlying historical claims data. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in testing management’s process for estimating the valuation of casualty insurance reserves, including evaluating the appropriateness of the actuarial valuation methods and the reasonableness of actuarial assumptions related to the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal cost associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\n\n \n\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\n\nFebruary 24, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

per share amounts)\n \n\n\n(1)\nDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\n \nDomino’s Pizza, Inc. (“DPI”), a Delaware corporation, conducts its operations and derives substantially all of its income from operations and cash provided by operating activities through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Domino’s, Inc. (“Domino’s”) and Domino’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Domino’s Pizza LLC. DPI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) are primarily engaged in the following business activities: (i) retail sales of food through Company-owned Domino’s Pizza stores; (ii) sales of food and other products to franchised Domino’s Pizza stores through Company-owned supply chain centers in the U.S. and Canada; (iii) receipt of royalties, advertising contributions and fees from U.S. Domino’s Pizza franchisees; and (iv) receipt of royalties and fees from international Domino’s Pizza franchisees.\n \nPrinciples of Consolidation\n \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DPI and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n \nFiscal Year\n \nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31. The 2024 fiscal year ended on December 29, 2024, the 2023 fiscal year ended on December 31, 2023 and the 2022 fiscal year ended on January 1, 2023. The 2024, 2023 and 2022\n fiscal years each consisted of fifty-two weeks.\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents\n \nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\n \nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents at December 29, 2024 included \n$\n144.0\n million\n of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of the Company’s asset-backed securitization structure, \n$\n51.2\n million\n of restricted cash equivalents held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and \n$\n0.2\n million\n of other restricted cash. As of December 29, 2024, the Company also held \n$\n80.9\n million\n of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s Pizza brand.\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 included \n$\n149.1\n million\n of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of the Company’s asset-backed securitization structure, \n$\n51.6\n million\n of restricted cash equivalents held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and \n$\n0.2\n million\n of other restricted cash. As of December 31, 2023, the Company also held \n$\n88.2\n million\n of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s Pizza brand.\n \nAllowances for Credit Losses\n \nThe Company closely monitors accounts and notes receivable balances and estimates the allowance for credit losses. These estimates are based on historical collection experience and other factors, including those related to current market conditions and events. The Company’s allowances for accounts and notes receivable have not historically been material.\n \nThe Company also monitors its off-balance sheet exposures under its letters of credit (Note 3), lease guarantees (Note 5) and surety bonds. Total conditional commitments under surety bonds were $\n11.8\n million at \nDecember 29, 2024\n and $\n14.7\n million at \nDecember 31, 2023\n. None of these arrangements has had or is likely to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, revenues, expenses or liquidity.\n \nInventories\n \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value.\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Assets\n \nCurrent and long-term other assets primarily include prepaid expenses such as insurance, taxes, deposits, notes receivable, software licenses, implementation costs for cloud-based computing arrangements, covenants not-to-compete and other intangible assets primarily arising from franchise acquisitions.\n \n \nOther long-term assets included implementation costs for cloud-based computing arrangements (primarily related to certain enterprise systems) of \n$\n14.5\n million\n and \n$\n11.1\n million\n, net of accumulated amortization of \n$\n9.7\n million\n and \n$\n6.2\n million\n as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023\n, respectively. Amortization expense for implementation costs for cloud-based computing arrangements was $\n3.5\n million, $\n2.7\n million and $\n1.9\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively.\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n \nAdditions to property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization expense are recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\n \n \nEstimated useful lives are generally as follows (in years):\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuildings\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeasehold and other improvements\n\n\n \n\n\n5 \n– \n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\n \n\n\n3 \n– \n15\n\n\n\n\n \nDepreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment was \n$\n55.8\n million\n, \n$\n52.4\n million\n and \n$\n51.8\n million\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively.\n \n \nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets\n \nThe Company evaluates the potential impairment of long-lived assets at least annually based on various analyses including, on an annual basis, the projection of undiscounted cash flows and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable, the Company compares the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. For Company-owned stores, the Company performs this evaluation on an operating market basis, which the Company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset, the Company estimates the fair value of the assets. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. There were no triggering events in 2024, 2023 and 2022 and accordingly, the Company did not record any impairment losses on long-lived assets in 2024, 2023 and 2022\n.\n \nInvestments in Marketable Securities\n \nInvestments in marketable securities consist of investments in various mutual funds made by eligible individuals as part of the Company’s deferred compensation plan (Note 8). These investments are stated at aggregate fair value, are restricted and have been placed in a rabbi trust whereby the amounts are irrevocably set aside to fund the Company’s obligations under the deferred compensation plan. The Company classifies and accounts for these investments in marketable securities as trading securities.\n \nGoodwill\n \n \nThe Company’s goodwill amounts primarily relate to franchise store acquisitions. The Company performs its required impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in 2024, 2023 and 2022\n.\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCapitalized Software\n \nCapitalized software is recorded at cost and includes purchased, internally-developed and externally-developed software used in the Company’s operations. Amortization expense is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, which range from one to ten years. Capitalized software amortization expense was \n$\n31.9\n million\n, \n$\n28.2\n million\n and \n$\n28.5\n million\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \n \nAs of \nDecember 29, 2024, scheduled amortization for capitalized software that had been placed in service as of December 29, 2024 is as follows in the table below. As of December 29, 2024, the Company also had $\n51.9\n million of capitalized software that had not yet been placed in service.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n28,340\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20,565\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,705\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,390\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,385\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20,752\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n103,137\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nInvestment in DPC Dash\n \nThe Company holds a non-controlling interest in DPC Dash Ltd (“DPC Dash”), the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. On March 28, 2023, DPC Dash completed its initial public offering on the Hong Kong Exchange (HK: 1405). The Company accounts for its investment in DPC Dash as a trading security and records it at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with gains and losses recorded in other income or expense in its consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 4 for fair value disclosures related to the Company’s investment in DPC Dash\n.\n \nDebt Issuance Costs\n \nDebt issuance costs are recorded as a reduction to the Company’s debt balance and primarily include the expenses incurred by the Company as part of the 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 Recapitalizations. Refer to Note 3 for a description of the 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 Recapitalizations. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis (which is materially consistent with the effective interest method) over the expected terms of the respective debt instrument to which the costs relate and is included in interest expense. Debt issuance cost amortization expense was \n$\n5.3\n million\n, \n$\n5.5\n million\n and \n$\n5.6\n million\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively.\n \nInsurance Reserves\n \nThe Company has retention programs for workers’ compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities for certain periods prior to December 1998 and for periods after December 2001. The Company is generally responsible for up to $\n1.0\n million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and up to $\n2.0\n million per occurrence under these retention programs for general liability, depending on policy year and line of coverage. The Company is also generally responsible for between $\n500,000\n and $\n5.5\n million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and non-owned automobile liabilities depending on the year. Total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending on the year covered and range up to $\n112.5\n million per occurrence for general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation.\n \nCasualty insurance reserves relating to the Company's retention programs are based on undiscounted actuarial estimates. These estimates are based on historical information and on certain assumptions about future events. Changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause these estimates to change in the near term. The Company generally receives estimates of outstanding casualty insurance exposures from its independent actuary twice per year and differences between these estimated actuarial exposures and the Company’s recorded amounts are adjusted as appropriate. The Company had reserves for these programs of \n$\n50.7\n million\n and \n$\n56.3\n million\n as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n \nIn addition, the Company maintains reserves for its share of employee health costs as part of the health care benefits offered to its employees. Reserves are based on undiscounted actuarial estimates based on underlying claims, including estimated claims incurred that have not yet been paid.\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nContract Liabilities\n \nContract liabilities consist primarily of deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees. Deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees of \n$\n5.1\n million\n and \n$\n5.3\n million\n were included in current other accrued liabilities as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees of \n$\n15.8\n million\n and $\n19.9\n million were included in long-term other accrued liabilities as of \nDecember 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n \nChanges in deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees in \n2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFiscal Year Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 29,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred franchise fees and deferred development fees, beginning of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n25,195\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n28,225\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue recognized during the period\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n6,098\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n6,468\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew deferrals due to cash received and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,849\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,438\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred franchise fees and deferred development fees, end of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n20,946\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n25,195\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe Company expects to recognize revenue associated with deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees as follows in the table below. The Company has applied the sales-based royalty exemption which permits exclusion of variable consideration in the form of sales-based royalties from the disclosure of remaining performance obligations.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,093\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,756\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,284\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,156\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,795\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,862\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n20,946\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nOther Accrued Liabilities\n \nCurrent and long-term other accrued liabilities primarily include accruals for income, sales, property and other taxes, legal reserves, operating expenses, dividends payable, deferred compensation, unredeemed gift cards and contract liabilities. The Company had \n$\n42.6\n million\n and \n$\n38.9\n million\n included in other current accrued liabilities related to unredeemed gift cards as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023\n, respectively.\n \nForeign Currency Translation\n \nThe Company’\ns foreign entities use their local currency as the functional currency. For these entities, the Company translates net assets into U.S. dollars at year end exchange rates, while income and expense accounts are translated at average annual exchange rates. Currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining net income.\n \nRevenue Recognition\nU.S. Company-owned stores revenues are comprised of retail sales of food through Company-owned Domino’s Pizza stores located in the U.S. and are recognized when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers. Customer payments are generally due at the time of sale. Sales taxes related to these sales are collected from customers and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority and are not reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of income as revenue.\nU.S. franchise royalties and fees are primarily comprised of royalties and fees from Domino’s Pizza franchisees with operations in the U.S. Each franchisee is generally required to pay a \n5.5\n% royalty fee on sales. In certain instances, the Company will collect lower rates based on area development agreements, sales initiatives, store relocation incentives and new store incentives. Royalty revenues are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales and are recognized when the items are delivered to or carried out by franchisees’ customers. U.S. franchise fee revenue primarily relates to per-transaction technology fees that are recognized as the related sales occur. From January 1, 2024 through March 24, 2024, the Company’s U.S. digital per-transaction technology fee was $\n0.395\n. As of March 25, 2024 and for the remainder of fiscal 2024, the Company’s U.S. digital per-transaction technology fee was $\n0.355\n. Payments for U.S. royalties and fees are generally due within seven days of the prior week end date.\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSupply chain revenues are primarily comprised of sales of food and other products to franchised Domino’s Pizza stores located in the U.S. and Canada. Revenues from the sale of food are recognized upon delivery of the food to franchisees and payments for food purchases are generally due within 30 days of the shipping date. The Company also offers profit sharing rebates and volume discounts to its franchisees. Obligations for profit sharing rebates are calculated based on actual results of its supply chain centers and are recognized as a reduction to revenue. Volume discounts are based on annual sales. The Company estimates the amount that will be earned and records a reduction to revenue throughout the year.\nInternational franchise royalties and fees are primarily comprised of royalties and fees from Domino’s Pizza franchisees outside of the U.S. Royalty revenues are recognized when the items are delivered to or carried out by franchisees’ customers. Royalty rates vary among international markets and may also differ based on certain incentives and concessions and averaged approximately \n3.0\n% in 2024. Franchise fees received from international franchisees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of each respective franchise store agreement, which is typically ten years. Development fees received from international master franchisees are also deferred when amounts are received and are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective master franchise agreement, which is typically ten years. International franchise fee revenues primarily relate to per-transaction technology fees that are recognized as the related sales occur. International franchise royalties and fees are invoiced at least quarterly, and payments are generally due within 60 days.\nU.S. franchise advertising revenues are comprised of contributions from Domino’s Pizza franchisees with operations in the U.S. to the Domino’s National Advertising Fund Inc. (“DNAF”), the Company’s consolidated not-for-profit subsidiary that administers the Domino’s Pizza system’s national and market level advertising activities in the U.S. Each franchisee is generally required to contribute \n6.0\n% of their retail sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns (subject, in certain instances, to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers). \nBeginning on March 27, 2023, the Company effectuated a temporary reduction of \n0.25\n% to its standard \n6.0\n% advertising contribution. \nThis temporary reduction expired at the beginning of the second quarter of 2024 and the advertising contribution rate returned to its standard \n6.0\n% as of March 25, 2024\n. These revenues are recognized when items are delivered to or carried out by franchisees’ customers. Payments for U.S. franchise advertising revenues are generally due within seven days of the prior week end date. Although these revenues are restricted to be used only for advertising and promotional activities to benefit franchised stores, the Company has determined there are not performance obligations associated with the franchise advertising contributions received by DNAF that are separate from its U.S. royalty payment stream and as a result, these franchise contributions and the related expenses are presented gross in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.\n \nDisaggregation of Revenue\nCurrent accounting standards require that companies disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The Company has included its revenues disaggregated in its consolidated statements of income to satisfy this requirement.\nSupply Chain Profit-Sharing Arrangements\n \nThe Company enters into profit-sharing arrangements with U.S. and Canadian franchisees that purchase all of their food from the Company’s supply chain centers. These profit-sharing arrangements generally offer Company-owned stores and participating franchisees \n50\n% of the pre-tax profit from the Company’s supply chain center operations. Profit-sharing obligations are recorded as a reduction to supply chain revenues in the same period as the related revenues and costs are recorded, and were \n$\n164.0\n million\n, \n$\n138.7\n million\n and \n$\n110.0\n million\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively.\n \nCost of Sales\n \nCost of sales consists primarily of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food and labor costs, as well as other costs including delivery, occupancy costs (including rent, telephone, utilities and depreciation) and insurance expense.\n \nGeneral and Administrative\n \nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of labor cost (including variable performance-based compensation expense and non-cash equity-based compensation expense), depreciation and amortization, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs.\n \n \n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdvertising\n \nU.S. stores are generally required to contribute a percentage of retail sales to DNAF, as described in the revenue recognition section above. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as DNAF is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the Domino’s brand. U.S. franchise advertising costs expended by DNAF are included in U.S. franchise advertising expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Advertising costs funded by Company-owned stores are generally expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense. Contributions from Company-owned stores that have not yet been expended are included in advertising fund assets, restricted on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\n \nAdvertising expense included \n$\n509.9\n million\n, \n$\n473.2\n million\n and \n$\n485.3\n million\n of U.S. franchise advertising expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Advertising expense also included \n$\n33.4\n million\n, \n$\n33.5\n million\n and \n$\n33.8\n million\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to advertising costs funded by U.S. Company-owned stores and other general marketing expenses which are included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.\n \n \nAs of December 29, 2024, advertising fund assets, restricted of \n$\n103.4\n million\n consisted of \n$\n80.9\n million\n of cash and cash equivalents, \n$\n14.3\n million\n of accounts receivable and \n$\n8.2\n million\n of prepaid expenses. As of December 29, 2024, advertising fund cash and cash equivalents included \n$\n1.8\n million\n of cash contributed from U.S. Company-owned stores that had not yet been expended.\n \nAs of December 31, 2023, advertising fund assets, restricted of \n$\n106.3\n million\n consisted of \n$\n88.2\n million\n of cash and cash equivalents, \n$\n14.0\n million\n of accounts receivable and \n$\n4.1\n million\n of prepaid expenses. As of December 31, 2023, advertising fund cash and cash equivalents included \n$\n2.1\n million\n of cash contributed from U.S. Company-owned stores that had not yet been expended.\n \nLeases\n \nThe Company leases certain retail store and supply chain center locations, vehicles, equipment and its corporate headquarters. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The majority of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases, which are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nRight-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date for leases exceeding 12 months. Minimum lease payments include only the fixed lease component of the agreement, as well as any variable rate payments that depend on an index, initially measured using the index at the lease commencement date. Lease terms may include options to renew when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nThe Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate for each lease using a portfolio approach based on the respective weighted average term of the agreements. This estimation considers the market rates of the Company’s outstanding collateralized borrowings and interpolations of rates outside of the terms of the outstanding borrowings, including comparisons to comparable borrowings of similarly rated companies with longer term borrowings.\nOperating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales or general and administrative expense. Amortization expense for finance leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales or general and administrative expense. Interest expense for finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method. Variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, payments associated with non-lease components and short-term rentals (leases with terms less than 12 months) are expensed as incurred.\n \n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCommon Stock Dividends\n \nThe Company declared dividends of \n$\n210.7\n million\n (or $\n6.04\n per share) in \n2024, \n$\n170.4\n million\n (or $\n4.84\n per share) in \n2023 and \n$\n157.5\n million\n (or $\n4.40\n per share) in \n2022. The Company paid dividends of \n$\n209.9\n million\n, \n$\n169.8\n million\n, and \n$\n157.5\n million\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSubsequent to the end of fiscal 2024, \no\nn \nFebruary 19, 2025\n, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of \n$\n1.74\n per common share payable on \nMarch 28, 2025\n to shareholders of record at the close of business on \nMarch 14, 2025\n.\nStock Options and Other Equity-Based Compensation Arrangements\n \nThe cost of all of the Company’s stock options, as well as other equity-based compensation arrangements, is reflected in the consolidated financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards (Note 9).\n \nEarnings Per Share\n \nThe Company discloses two calculations of earnings per share (“EPS”): basic EPS and diluted EPS (Note 2). The numerator in calculating common stock basic and diluted EPS is consolidated net income. The denominator in calculating common stock basic EPS is the weighted average shares outstanding. The denominator in calculating common stock diluted EPS includes the additional dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, unvested restricted stock awards and units and unvested performance-based restricted stock awards and units.\n \nSupplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information\n \nThe Company paid interest of $\n185.0\n million, $\n186.8\n million and $\n188.5\n million during \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively, on its Notes (Note 3). Cash paid for income taxes was $\n161.0\n million, $\n136.3\n million and $\n134.4\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company had non-cash investing activities related to accruals for capital expenditures of \n$\n3.1\n million\n, \n$\n6.7\n million\n and \n$\n6.9\n million\n at December 29, 2024, December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. As of December 29, 2024, the Company had \n$\n3.0\n million\n in non-cash financing activity related to accruals for excise taxes on share repurchases. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had \n$\n2.6\n million\n i\nn non-cash financing activity related to accruals for excise taxes on share repurchases, which was paid in 2024.\n \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n \nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\n \nThe Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and adopted the following accounting standard.\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued \nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”)\n, which requires disclosure on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within the reported measure of segment profit or loss. In addition, the ASU requires disclosure of other segment expenses by reportable segment and a description of their composition to permit the reconciliation between segment revenue, significant segment expenses and the reported segment measure of profit or loss. The ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker.\n \nOn December 29, 2024, the end of the 2024 fiscal year, the Company adopted ASU 2023-07 and included the relevant disclosures within Note 11, \nSegment Information. \nThe Company has presented the disclosures for significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker retrospectively for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of income.\n \n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\n \nThe Company has considered all new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB. The Company has not yet adopted the following standards:\nASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued \nASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”)\n, which requires disclosure on an annual basis, a tabular reconciliation, including both amount and percentage of specific categories of the effective tax rate reconciliation, including state and local income taxes (net of Federal taxes), foreign taxes, effects of changes in tax laws and regulations, effects of cross-border tax laws, tax credits, changes in valuation allowances, nontaxable and nondeductible items and changes in unrecognized tax benefits.

The restrictions placed on the Company’s subsidiaries require that the Company’s principal and interest obligations have first priority and amounts are segregated weekly to ensure appropriate funds are reserved to pay the quarterly principal and interest amounts due. The amount of weekly cash flow that exceeds the required weekly principal and interest reserve is generally remitted to the Company in the form of a dividend. However, once the required obligations are satisfied, there are no further restrictions, including payment of dividends, on the cash flows of the subsidiaries.\n \nThe Notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. The covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of \n1.75\nx total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the indenture governing the securitized debt. The covenants, among other things, may limit the ability of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries to declare dividends, make loans or advances or enter into transactions with affiliates. In the event that certain covenants are not met, the Notes may become partially or fully due and payable on an accelerated schedule. In addition, the Company may voluntarily prepay, in part or in full, the Notes at any time, subject to certain make-whole interest obligations.\nWhile the Notes are outstanding, scheduled payments of principal and interest are required to be made on a quarterly basis. The payment of principal of the Notes may be suspended if the Holdco Leverage Ratio for the Company is less than or equal to \n5.0\nx total debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, each as defined in the indenture governing the securitized debt. Scheduled principal payments will resume upon failure to satisfy the aforementioned leverage ratio on an ongoing basis and no catch-up provisions are applicable.\nLeverage Ratio and Debt Classification\n \nAs of the end of each of the fiscal quarters in 2024, the Company had a Holdco Leverage Ratio of less than \n5.0\nx, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payments for its outstanding notes beginning in the second quarter of 2024. Accordingly, the outstanding principal amounts of the Company’s 2021 Notes, 2019 Notes, 2018 9.25-Year Notes and 2017 Ten-Year Notes have been classified as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of \nDecember 29, 2024.\n \nThe anticipated repayment date for the 2018 7.5-Year Notes and the 2015 Ten-Year Notes is October 2025 and accordingly, the outstanding principal amounts for these notes have been classified as current portion of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2024\n. The Company expects to refinance the 2018 7.5-Year Notes and the 2015 Ten-Year Notes prior to the anticipated repayment date. If the Company does not refinance the 2018 7.5-Year Notes and the 2015 Ten-Year Notes prior to the anticipated repayment date, additional interest of at least \n5\n% per annum will accrue and the Company’s cash flows other than technology fees and a weekly management fee to cover certain general and administrative expenses would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt.\n \n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConsolidated Long-Term Debt\n \nAt \nDecember 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, consolidated long-term debt consisted of the following:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 29,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015 Ten-Year Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n742,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n744,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017 Ten-Year Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n940,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n942,500\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 7.5-Year Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n402,688\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n403,750\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 9.25-Year Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n379,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n380,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019 Ten-Year Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n648,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n649,688\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 7.5-Year Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n826,625\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n828,750\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 Ten-Year Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n972,500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n975,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance lease obligations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n66,058\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n73,482\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancing obligation from sale leaseback\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,788\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,877\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization\n   of $34.5 million in 2024 and $29.2 million in 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n16,321\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n21,619\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal debt\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,975,338\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,990,428\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1,149,679\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n56,366\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term debt, less current portion\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,825,659\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,934,062\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAt \nDecember 29, 2024, maturities of long-term debt, finance leases and other financing obligations were as follows below and reflect the total amounts due for each of the Notes on their respective anticipated repayment dates assuming the Holdco Leverage Ratio remains less than or equal to 5.0x.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,149,679\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,991\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,324,246\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n831,088\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n652,765\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,027,890\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,991,659\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(4)\nFair Value Measurements\n \nFair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.

The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s Notes and, at times, trade these Notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the noteholders could realize in a current market exchange.

the fourth quarter of 2023, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with a developer to sell one of the Company’s owned supply chain center buildings and the associated land for $\n14.9\n million. Concurrently, a separate subsidiary of the Company entered into a lease agreement with the developer to construct a new supply chain center which includes both the existing building as well as an adjoined new construction on the adjacent properties owned by the developer.\n \nThe leaseback of the Company’s building on a standalone basis for the construction period plus the 20-year term using the discount rate implicit in the lease resulted in a finance lease classification, and therefore, the transaction was accounted for as a failed sale leaseback. The Company retained the existing land and buildings on its consolidated balance sheet which are included in property, plant and equipment and the Company continues to depreciate the building as if it owned it. The $\n14.9\n million cash proceeds from the transaction were recorded as a financing obligation which is classified as long-term debt in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized into principal and interest expense over the term of the lease agreement. The $\n119.5\n million of future minimum rent payments associated with the new construction on a standalone basis is included in the disclosure for material leases not yet commenced, below.\n \nAs of December 29, 2024\n, in addition to the lease for the new supply chain construction on a standalone basis discussed above, the Company also had additional leases for certain supply chain real estate and certain supply chain vehicles that had not yet commenced. The total estimated future minimum rental commitments for all of these arrangements is $\n178.0\n million. These leases are expected to commence in 2025 with lease terms of up to \n20\n years. These undiscounted amounts are not included in the table above.\nThe Company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees was $\n12.8\n million and $\n18.5\n million as of \nDecember 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023\n, respectively. The Company does not believe these arrangements have or are likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures or liquidity.\n\n\n \n\n\n(6)\nCommitments and Contingencies\n \nThe Company is a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and legal proceedings, of which the majority involve workers’ compensation, employment practices liability, general liability and automobile and franchisee claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records legal fees associated with loss contingencies when they are probable and reasonably estimable. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual litigated matters is unpredictable. These matters could be decided unfavorably and could require the Company to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts that cannot be estimated with accuracy. However, the Company does not believe these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company, and the Company expects that the established accruals adequately provide for the estimated resolution of such claims.\n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(7)\nIncome Taxes\n \nIncome before provision for income taxes in \n2024,

the Company\n’\ns ability to generate sufficient taxable income. Although realization of the Company\n’\ns deferred tax assets is not assured, on an ongoing basis, management assesses whether it remains more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized.\n \n \nAs of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had total foreign tax credits of \n$\n21.0\n million\n and \n$\n16.8\n million\n, respectively, which were fully offset with a corresponding valuation allowance. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also had valuation allowances related to interest deductibility in separately filed states of \n$\n1.4\n million\n and \n$\n1.4\n million\n, respectively. Management believes the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized. For financial reporting purposes, the Company\n’\ns investment in foreign subsidiaries does not exceed its tax basis. Therefore, no deferred income taxes have been provided.\n \nThe Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authorities widely understood administrative practices and precedents. For tax positions meeting the “more likely than not” threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and recognizes penalties in income tax expense.\n \n \nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of \nDecember 29, 2024, December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 is as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 29,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nJanuary 1,\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,918\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,902\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,690\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditions for tax positions of current year\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,039\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n961\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n887\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n241\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n503\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n958\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReductions for changes in prior year tax positions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n551\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n4,521\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReductions for lapses of applicable statute of limitations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n664\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n897\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1,112\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,534\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,918\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,902\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n77\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 29, 2024\n, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $\n4.5\n million of which, if ultimately recognized, $\n4.5\n million would be recognized as an income tax benefit and reduce the Company\n’\ns effective tax rate. As of December 29, 2024\n, the Company had $\n0.6\n million of accrued interest and \nno\n accrued penalties.\n \n \nAs of December 31, 2023\n, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $\n3.9\n million of which, if ultimately recognized, $\n3.9\n million would be recognized as an income tax benefit and reduce the Company\n’\ns effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2023\n, the Company had $\n0.4\n million of accrued interest and \nno\n accrued penalties.\n \nThere are currently no Internal Revenue Service audits in progress for the Company. The Company continues to be under examination by certain states. The Company\n’\ns Federal statute of limitation has expired for years prior to 2021, but it varies for state and foreign locations. The Company believes appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.\n\n\n(8)\nEmployee Benefits\n \nThe Company has a retirement savings plan which qualifies under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k). All employees of the Company who have completed 60 days of service and are at least 18 years of age are eligible to participate in the plan\n. The plan requires the Company to match \n100\n% of the first \n5\n% of each employee’s elective deferrals. The Company’s matching contributions are made in the form of cash and vest immediately. The expenses incurred for Company \ncontributions\n to the plan were \n$\n14.1\n million\n, \n$\n12.5\n million\n and \n$\n12.4\n million\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \n \nThe Company has established a non-qualified deferred compensation plan available for certain key employees. Under this self-funding plan, the participants may defer up to \n40\n% of their base salary and up to \n80\n% of their bonus compensation. Beginning in fiscal 2025, participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 80% of their bonus compensation. The participants direct the investment of their deferred compensation within several investment funds. The Company is not required to \ncontribute\n and did \nno\nt contribute to this plan during \n2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \nThe Company has an employee stock payroll deduction plan (the “ESPDP”). Under the ESPDP, eligible employees may deduct up to \n15\n% of their eligible wages to purchase common stock at \n85\n% of the market price of the stock at the purchase date. The ESPDP requires employees to hold their purchased common stock for at least one year. The Company purchases common stock on the open market for the ESPDP at the current market price. There were \n15,935\n shares, \n18,439\n shares and \n17,378\n shares of common stock in \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively, purchased on the open market for participating employees at a weighted-average price of $\n450.59\n in \n2024\n, $\n341.76\n in \n2023\n and $\n391.23\n in \n2022\n. The expenses incurred under the ESPDP were $\n1.0\n million, $\n0.9\n million, and $\n1.0\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively.\n\n\n(9)\nEquity Incentive Plans\n \nThe Company’s current equity incentive plan, named the Domino’s Pizza, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Equity Incentive Plan”), benefits certain of the Company’s employees and members of the Company’s Board of Directors. As of December 29, 2024\n, the maximum number of shares that may be granted under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan is \n15,600,000\n shares of voting common stock of which \n2,084,307\n shares were authorized for grant but have not been granted.\n \nThe cost of all employee stock options, as well as other equity-based compensation arrangements, is reflected in the consolidated statements of income based on the estimated fair value of the awards and is amortized over the requisite service period of each award. All non-cash equity-based compensation expense amounts are recorded in general and administrative expense. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\n \nThe Company recorded total non-cash equity-based compensation expense of \n$\n43.3\n million\n, \n$\n37.5\n million\n and \n$\n28.7\n million\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively. The Company recorded a deferred tax benefit related to non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $\n6.8\n million, $\n6.3\n million and $\n4.9\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStock Options\n \nAs of December 29, 2024, the number of stock options granted and outstanding under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan was \n458,294\n options. Stock options granted in fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2020 were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price at the date of the grant, expire \nten years\n from the date of grant and generally vested over four years from the date of grant, generally subject to the holder’s continued employment. Stock options granted after fiscal 2020 were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price at the date of the grant, expire ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over three years from the date of grant, generally subject to the holder’s continued employment. Additionally, all stock options granted become fully exercisable upon vesting. These awards also contain provisions for accelerated vesting upon the retirement of the holders that have achieved specific service and age requirements.\n \n \nStock option activity related to the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan is summarized as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCommon Stock Options\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOutstanding\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nLife\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(Years)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(In thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options at January 2, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n664,117\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n189.64\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options granted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49,716\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n393.44\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options forfeited or expired\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n8,712\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n375.23\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options exercised\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n32,979\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.44\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options at January 1, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n672,142\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n206.69\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options granted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n104,711\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n300.16\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options forfeited or expired\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n11,973\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n351.89\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options exercised\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n78,532\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n110.22\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options at December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n686,348\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n229.45\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options granted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46,098\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n443.90\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options forfeited or expired\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n3,728\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n348.25\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options exercised\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n270,424\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n133.21\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock options at December 29, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n458,294\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n306.85\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n56,919\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercisable at December 29, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n334,194\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n285.84\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n48,051\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was \n$\n93.5\n m\nillion, $\n19.6\n million and $\n8.8\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The tax benefit realized from stock options exercised was $\n20.8\n million, $\n4.2\n million and $\n1.9\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \nThe Company recorded total non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $\n6.7\n \nmillion, $\n5.8\n million and $\n4.2\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to stock option awards. As of December 29, 2024\n, there was $\n7.9\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the related vesting period. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.7\n years.\n \n \nManagement estimated the fair value of each option grant made during 2024, 2023 and 2022 as of the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the estimated expected life and is estimated based on U.S. Treasury Bond rates as of the grant date. The expected life is based on several factors, including, among other things, the vesting term and contractual term as well as historical experience. The expected volatility is based principally on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and changes in assumptions can significantly affect the estimated fair value of the Company\n’\ns stock options.\n \n \nThe weighted average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of each stock option granted in \n2024, 2023 and 2022 using the Black-Scholes option pricing method are presented in the following table:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk-free interest rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected life\n\n\n \n\n\n5.25\n years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.25 \nyears\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.25\n years\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected volatility\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n31.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected dividend yield\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average fair value per stock option\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n139.87\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n91.25\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n109.05\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Equity-Based Compensation Arrangements\n \nThe Company granted \n3,322\n units, \n4,553\n units and \n3,792\n shares of restricted stock in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to members of its Board of Directors. Restricted stock units and awards granted to members of the Company’s Board of Directors were granted with a fair value equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date and generally vest one year from the date of grant, generally subject to the director’s continued service. These awards also contain provisions for accelerated vesting upon the retirement eligibility of the holders that have achieved specified service and age requirements.\n \nThe Company grant\ned \n64,272\n units, \n125,285\n units and \n81,739\n units of restricted stock in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to certain employees of the Company. These restricted stock units were granted with a fair value equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. These restricted stock units are generally separated into three tranches and have time-based vesting conditions with the last tranche of the award vesting three years from the grant date, generally subject to the holder’s continued employment. These awards generally also contain provisions for accelerated vesting upon the retirement of the holders that have achieved specified service and age requirements.\n \nThe Company granted \n17,670\n units, \n37,677\n units and \n8,921\n units of performance-based restricted stock in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to certain employees of the Company. These restricted stock units were granted with a fair value equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date, certain of which were adjusted for the estimated fair value of the market condition included in the award. These performance-based restricted stock units may vest three years from the date of grant, generally subject to the holder’s continued employment, and have time- and performance-based vesting conditions which provide for potential payouts of the target award amount between zero percent and two hundred percent, based on the Company’s three-year achievement as compared to the specified target performance conditions. Certain of the performance-based restricted stock units also include provisions for a potential modifier (upward or downward) based on the Company’s cumulative three-year common stock total shareholder return performance relative to that of a pre-established peer group. These awards contain provisions for full or partial vesting if the holder retires during the performance period, after achieving specified service and age requirements. For the awards with a market condition, Management estimated the fair value of each performance-based restricted stock unit using a Monte-Carlo simulation pricing method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the estimated expected life and is estimated based on U.S. Treasury Bond rates as of the grant date. The Monte-Carlo simulation also includes assumptions for expected volatility based principally on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price, as well as the correlation of the Company’s share price as compared to that of the pre-established peer group.\n \nThe weighted average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units granted in \n2024, 2023 and 2022 that include a market condition using the Monte-Carlo simulation pricing method are presented in the following table:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk-free interest rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected life\n\n\n \n\n\n2.81\n years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.80 \nyears\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.81\n years\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected volatility\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average fair value per performance-based restricted stock unit\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n479.39\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n306.19\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n396.87\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe Company previously granted performance-based restricted stock to certain employees of the Company. These performance-based restricted stock awards were separated into four tranches and had time-based and performance-based vesting conditions with the last tranche vesting four years from the issuance date, generally subject to the holder\n’\ns continued employment. These awards contained provisions for full or partial vesting if the holder retires during the performance period, after achieving specified service and age requirements. The final tranche of these performance-based restricted stock awards vested in 2024.\n In 2018, the Company granted \n28,570\n shares of restricted stock to two executives of the Company. These awards had a fair value equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date and vested in 2022, four years from the date of the grant.\n \n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nActivity related to restricted stock awards and units and performance-based restricted stock awards and units awarded under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan is summarized as follows in the table below. The Company recorded total non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $\n36.6\n million, $\n31.7\n million and $\n24.5\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to these restricted stock awards and units and performance-based restricted stock awards and units. Certain prior period disclosure amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. As of December 29, 2024\n, there was $\n49.2\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to these restricted stock awards and units and performance-based restricted stock awards and units. The unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards and units and performance-based restricted stock awards and units is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \n2.0\n years.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nShares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonvested at January 2, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n145,261\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n339.37\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares granted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n94,452\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n389.49\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares forfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n18,563\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n375.36\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares vested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n75,506\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n312.90\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonvested at January 1, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n145,644\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n381.00\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares granted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n167,515\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n315.51\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares forfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n9,799\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n354.44\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares vested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n54,225\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n368.41\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonvested at December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n249,135\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n341.86\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares granted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n85,264\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n453.64\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares forfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n15,216\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n362.18\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares vested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n74,265\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n356.22\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonvested at December 29, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n244,918\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n373.58\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(10)\nCapital Structure\n \nOn February 21, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional share repurchase program to repurchase up to $\n1.0\n billion of the Company’s common stock, in addition to the $\n141.3\n million that was previously remaining under the previous July 20, 2021 authorization for a total authorization of $\n1.14\n billion for future share repurchases as of that date. As of \nDecember 29, 2024, the Company had \n$\n814.3\n million\n remaining under its authorization for repurchases of shares of the Company’s common stock.\n \nThe Company’s share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from the Company’s recapitalization transactions and borrowings under the Company’s variable funding notes. The Company’s policy is to recognize the difference between the purchase price and par value of the common stock in additional paid-in capital. In instances where there is no additional paid-in capital, the difference is recognized in retained deficit.\n \n \nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased \n758,242\n shares, \n789,977\n shares and \n739,847\n shares of the Company’s common stock for \n$\n327.0\n million\n, \n$\n269.0\n million\n and \n$\n293.7\n million\n, respectively.\n \nAs of December 29, 2024\n, authorized common stock consists of \n160,000,000\n voting shares and \n10,000,000\n non-voting shares. \nThe share components of outstanding common stock at \nDecember 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 29,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoting\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34,278,732\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34,722,988\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Voting\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,195\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,194\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Common Stock\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34,281,927\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34,726,182\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n81\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(11)\nSegment Information\n \nThe Company has \nthree\n reportable segments: (i) U.S. stores; (ii) supply chain; and (iii) international franchise.\n \n \nThe Company’s operations are organized by management on the combined basis of line of business and geography. The U.S. stores segment includes operations with respect to all franchised and Company-owned stores throughout the U.S. The supply chain segment primarily includes the distribution of food, and to a lesser extent, other products, from the Company’s supply chain center operations in the U.S. and Canada. Over \n90\n% of the Company’s supply chain revenues are attributable to the U.S. The international franchise segment includes operations related to the Company’s franchising business in foreign markets. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer, and he evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments and allocates resources to them based on revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. The Company uses Segment Income to determine future business objectives and targets and for long-range planning for the reportable segments, as well as to evaluate their operating performance.\n \nThe tables below summarize the financial information, including revenues, significant segment expenses, Segment Income and capital expenditures, concerning the Company’s reportable segments for fiscal years \n2024, 2023 and 2022. Intersegment revenues are comprised of sales of food, and to a lesser extent, other products, from the supply chain segment to the Company-owned stores in the U.S. stores segment.

This allocation methodology change was implemented in order to reflect the way the chief operating decision maker allocates resources to the Company’s reportable segments and evaluates segment profitability, including the costs of internally developed software. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of \n$\n65.7\n million\n and an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of \n$\n8.9\n million\n. These estimated increases in U.S. stores and international franchise Segment Income were offset by a corresponding $\n74.6\n million decrease in unallocated general and administrative - other expenses. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs in 2023 had no impact on revenues, income from operations or supply chain Segment Income. The change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs was a prospective change and the comparative information for fiscal \n2022 has not been restated.\n\n\n83\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s identifiable asset information by reportable segment as of \nDecember 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 29,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. stores\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n240,408\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n232,336\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply chain\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n641,523\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n631,908\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational franchise\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n38,306\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37,981\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReportable segment assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n920,237\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n902,225\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnallocated\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n816,776\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n772,674\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,737,013\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,674,899\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nUnallocated assets primarily include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, certain accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, investments and marketable securities, certain long-lived assets including certain property, plant and equipment, capitalized software and the operating lease right-of-use asset for the Company’s corporate headquarters and deferred income taxes.

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that all information required in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act was accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period required by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(b)\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\n\n\n \n\n\nThere have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(c)\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe management of Domino’s Pizza, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024 based on the framework in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 29, 2024. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\n\n\n \n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nItem 9B.
