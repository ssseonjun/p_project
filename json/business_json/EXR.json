    "item1": "Item 1.     Business\nGeneral\nExtra Space Storage Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004. We closed our initial public offering (“IPO”) on August 17, 2004. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “EXR.”\nWe were formed to continue the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries, which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. These companies were reorganized after the consummation of our IPO and various formation transactions. Our executive management team and board of directors have extensive experience and ownership positions in the Company. \nSubstantially all of our business is conducted through Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating Partnership”). Our primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). To the extent we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be subject to U.S. federal tax, with certain exceptions, on our REIT taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders.\nOur principal offices are located at 2795 East Cottonwood Parkway, Suite 300, Salt Lake City, Utah 84121, telephone number (801) 365-4600.\nOur internet address is www.extraspace.com. We file our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You may obtain copies of these documents by visiting the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are furnished to the SEC, we make copies of these documents available to the public free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website. \nSelf-Storage Operations\nWe own, operate, manage, provide lending to, acquire, develop and redevelop self-storage properties (“stores”). We operate and manage our business by evaluating the operating performance of the properties for our entire portfolio which includes wholly-owned stores, stores in which we have a partial ownership interest and managed stores. Stores offer month-to-month rental of storage space for personal or business use.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned and/or operated 4,011 stores in 42 states, and Washington, D.C., comprising approximately 308.4 million square feet of net rentable space in approximately 2.8 million units.\nOther Operations\nOur tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores. Our customers have the option of purchasing insurance from a non-affiliated insurance company to cover certain losses to their goods stored at our facilities, as well as those we manage for third parties. A wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary fully reinsures such policies and thereby assumes all risk of losses under these policies and receives reinsurance premiums, substantially equal to the premiums collected from our tenants, from the non-affiliated insurance company.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we managed 1,575 stores for third party owners. Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees as well as expand our geographic footprint, data sophistication and scale with little capital investment. We believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, our management business is a potential future acquisition pipeline.\nWe have a bridge lending program, under which we provide financing to third party self storage owners for operating properties that we manage. This program helps us increase our management business, create additional potential future acquisition opportunities, and strengthen our relationships with partners, all while generating interest and fee income. We generally originate mortgage loans and mezzanine loans with the option to sell a portion of the mortgage loans to third parties, while retaining our interests in the mezzanine loans. As of December 31, 2024, the total balance of bridge loans receivable was $1.2 billion.\n5\nWe have made investments in preferred stock of other self-storage companies. These investments benefit us by providing dividend income, creating additional potential future acquisition opportunities through relationships with the companies in which we invest, or increasing our management business.\nOperating Segments\nWe operate in two distinct segments: (1) self-storage operations; and (2) tenant reinsurance. Our self-storage operations activities include rental operations of wholly-owned stores. Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores. For more information and comparative financial and other information on our reportable business segments, refer to the segment information footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLong-Term Growth and Investment Strategies\nOur primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable long-term growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term stockholder value both at acceptable levels of risk. We continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities. Our primary strategies include the following:\nMaximize the performance of our stores through strategic, efficient and proactive management\nWe pursue revenue-generating and expense-minimizing opportunities in our operations. We seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems' ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management. We have implemented one of the most dynamic online marketing programs in the industry, which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost compared with our competitors.\nWe continually analyze our portfolio to look for long-term value-enhancing opportunities. We proactively redevelop properties to add units or modify existing unit mix to better meet the demand in a given market and to maximize revenue. We also redevelop properties to extend their useful life, increase visual appeal, enhance security and improve brand consistency across the portfolio.\nAcquire self-storage stores\nOur acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multi-store portfolios and single stores which can range from fully occupied to various stages of lease-up that we believe can provide stockholder value. We have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. In addition, we believe our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals. We remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value.\nIn addition to the pursuit of operating stores, from time to time we develop stores from the ground up, frequently in a joint venture with a developer, and provide the construction capital. We also purchase stores at the completion of construction from third party developers, who build to our specifications. These stores purchased at completion of construction (a “Certificate of Occupancy store”) create additional long-term value for our stockholders. We are typically able to acquire these assets at a lower price than a stabilized store, and we expect greater long term returns on these stores on average. However, in the short term, these acquisitions cause dilution to our earnings during the two-to-four year period required to lease up the Certificate of Occupancy stores. We expect that this trend will continue as we continue to acquire Certificate of Occupancy stores.\nFinancing of Our Long-Term Growth Strategies\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Consequently, we require access to additional sources of capital to fund our growth. We expect to maintain a flexible approach to financing growth. We plan to finance future acquisitions, store development and re-development, capital expenditures and our bridge loan program through a diverse capital optimization strategy which includes, but is not limited to, the following: cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving lines of credit (the “Credit Lines”), commercial paper, secured and unsecured financing, equity offerings, joint ventures and the sale of stores.\nCredit Lines - \nWe have two credit lines which we primarily use as short-term bridge financing until we obtain longer-term financing through either debt or equity. As of December 31, 2024, our Credit Lines had available capacity of $2.1 billion, of which $1.3 billion was undrawn.\n6\nCommercial Paper\n - We have a commercial paper program which we use as short-term financing until we obtain longer-term financing through either debt or equity. As of December 31, 2024, our commercial paper program had available capacity of $1.0 billion, of which $500 million was undrawn.\nSecured and Unsecured Debt -\n We primarily use public bonds, unsecured private placement bonds and unsecured bank term loans to finance store acquisitions and development efforts. We will continue to utilize a combination of secured and unsecured financing for future store acquisitions and development. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.0 billion of secured notes payable and $10.2 billion of unsecured notes payable outstanding.\nEquity - \nWe have an active “at the market” (“ATM”) program for selling stock. We sell stock under the ATM program from time to time to raise capital when we believe conditions are advantageous. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we did not issue or sell any shares of common stock.\nWe view equity interests in our Operating Partnership as another source of capital that can provide an attractive tax planning opportunity to sellers of real estate. We issue common and preferred Operating Partnership units to sellers in certain acquisitions. Common Operating Partnership units receive distributions equal to the dividends on common stock, while Preferred Operating Partnership units receive distributions at various negotiated rates. We may issue additional units in the future when circumstances are favorable. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued 623,621 Operating Partnership units.\nJoint Ventures - \nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned 460 of our stores through unconsolidated joint ventures with third parties. Our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the acquisition of stores owned in these joint ventures. Most joint venture agreements include buy-sell rights, as well as rights of first offer in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture. We manage the day-to-day operations of the stores owned in these joint ventures and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture, but we do not control the joint ventures.\nSale of Properties - \nWe have not historically sold a high volume of stores, as we generally believe we are able to optimize the cash flow from stores through continued operations. However, we may sell more stores or interests in stores in the future in response to changing economic, financial or investment conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold six stores for $102.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not sell any stores.\nIndustry & Competition\nWe are the largest self-storage operator in the United States. Our three primary competitors who are public self-storage REITs are CubeSmart, National Storage Affiliates and Public Storage.\nStores offer month-to-month rental of storage space for personal or business use. Tenants typically rent fully enclosed spaces that vary in size and typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet, with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet.  Tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units. Stores generally have on-site managers who supervise and run the day-to-day operations, providing tenants with assistance as needed.\nSelf-storage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes, or simply because of a need for storage space. The mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are experiencing life changes such as downsizing their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence. Items that tenants place in self-storage may include furniture, household items and appliances. Commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods, records, inventory or storage for seasonal goods.\nOur research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on price and the convenience of the site to their home or business, making high-density, high-traffic population centers ideal locations for stores. A store’s visibility on the internet, perceived security, cleanliness, and the general professionalism of the store managers and staff are also contributing factors to a store’s ability to successfully secure rentals. Although most stores are leased to tenants on a month-to-month basis, tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time.\nThe self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are typically realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. The self-storage industry is a mature industry with average occupancies that are typically at or above 90%. Our average occupancy for our same-store pool for 2024 was 93.9%.\n7\nThe self-storage industry is characterized by fragmented ownership, where the largest companies in the industry own a fraction of the operating stores. The remainder of the industry is characterized by numerous small, local operators. The scarcity of capital available to small operators for acquisitions and expansions, internet marketing, call centers, and the potential for savings through economies of scale are factors that are leading to consolidation in the industry. We believe that, as a result of this trend, significant growth opportunities exist for operators with proven management systems and sufficient capital resources to grow through acquisitions and/or third-party management platforms. \nWe believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions. We have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire existing operating stores, especially for brokered portfolios. Competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities, and this will likely continue.  \nRegulation\nGenerally, stores are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Changes in any of these laws or regulations, as well as changes in laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act, which increases the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores, or laws affecting development, construction, operation, limitations on rent increases due to state of emergency or similar orders, upkeep, safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of stores or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, noncompliance with any of these laws, ordinances or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could require substantial capital expenditures to ensure compliance.\nInsurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act and are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto. Store management activities may be subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state. Our collection and processing of personal information may be subject to various data privacy and security laws, which govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information and are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. Changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nHuman Capital\nAt Extra Space, our culture is driven by our belief that our people are a key driver in our success. We believe that if we focus on attracting, developing, and retaining diverse top talent at all levels of the organization, our employees will take care of our customers and drive growth for our shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 8,012 employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement. In 2024, we invited our employees to participate in an employee satisfaction survey and achieved an overall satisfaction score of 75% with 94% of our employees participating in our survey. \nCompensation, Health and Well Being\nWe offer competitive health benefits and encourage our employees to participate in employee health and wellness programs. We offer our employees a health concierge service that helps them navigate their healthcare, from finding providers, comparing costs and resolving complex claims issues. We also offer other health-oriented benefits such as a fitness program that allows for reimbursements to employees for expenses incurred relating to fit-friendly activities, sports or exercise equipment. We also provide employees access to a network of childcare and elder care providers.\nTraining and Development\nIn order to attract and retain diverse top talent, we believe strongly that development is a continuous journey throughout the employee's career. We provide formal development programs which are available to employees who are ready for an intense structured experience. In 2024, we invested in training and development for our employees, which included leadership training, communication training, individual development plans, site manager training and mentorship programs. Our field employees received an aver\nage of 17 ho\nurs of training and each new hire received an average of 82 hours of training in 2024. \n8\nInclusion and Values\n•\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive culture and living our core values of integrity, teamwork, excellence, passion and innovation. In \n2024\n, we continued to expand participation in our employee resource groups, which provide employees with opportunities to build connections, celebrate culture, access mentoring, and engage in educational initiatives that strengthen our workplace community. \n•\nInclusion is central to our values and culture at Extra Space. We believe that excellence and innovation stem from diverse perspectives, integrity is upheld through equitable practices, and optimal teamwork thrives in an inclusive environment. We strive to ensure every employee feels engaged and empowered to bring their whole selves to work, fueling their passion and commitment to our shared goals.  \nWe believe that our emphasis on training and development, employee safety, employee health and well-being, and a commitment to our values leads to an increase in employee engagement and positions us to attract and retain top diverse talent.",
    "item1a": "Item 1A.     Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report before trading in our securities. If any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments. We are a real estate company that derives our income from the operation of our stores. There are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate, including the following:\nRisks Related to Our Stores and Operations\nAdverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results.\nOur revenues and net operating income can be negatively impacted by general economic factors and other conditions that lead to a reduction in demand for rental space in the markets in which we operate. Our operations, revenues and operating income may be adversely impacted by, for example, increases in unemployment rates, rising interest rates, changing demographics, decreases in the volume of housing market transactions, recessions, perceptions about the safety of our stores, changes in local zoning laws, consequences from climate change, public health emergencies, as well as earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, terrorist acts, civil disturbances or acts of war.\nIf we are unable to promptly re-let our units or if the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than expected, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nNearly all of our leases are on a month-to-month basis. Any delay in re-letting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, lower than expected rental rates upon re-letting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth.\nUninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage, or increasing insurance deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow.\nWe maintain comprehensive property and casualty insurance policies, including liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as we deem necessary or as required by our lenders), umbrella coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores. Certain types of losses, however, may be either uninsurable, not economically insurable, or coverage may be excluded on certain policies, such as losses due to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war, terrorism, or social engineering. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store. In addition, if any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. Also, insurance deductibles may continue increasing. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nLegal disputes, settlement and defense costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nFrom time to time we have to make monetary settlements or defend actions or arbitration (including class actions) to resolve tenant, employment-related or other claims and disputes. Settling any such liabilities could negatively impact our \n9\noperating results and cash available for distribution to stockholders and could also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, operate or encumber affected properties.\nOur tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation, which may adversely affect our results.\nOur tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation. The regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, to promulgate, interpret and implement regulations, and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers. As a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction, we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities, or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnder various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner, developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, which could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return.\nCosts associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses.\nUnder the ADA, places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores, or restrict certain further renovations of the stores, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. If one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ADA or other legislation, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance.\nThere is significant competition among self-storage operators and from other storage alternatives.\nCompetition in the local markets in which many of our stores are located is significant and has affected our occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses. Development of self-storage facilities has increased in recent years, which has intensified competition, and we expect it will continue to do so as newly developed facilities are opened. Development of self-storage facilities by other operators could continue to increase in the future. Actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases in our occupancy and rental rates, while increasing our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth.\nOur ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. We may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price.\nOur ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks:\n•\ncompetition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital, including other publicly-traded REITs and institutional investment funds;\n•\ncompetition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability;\n•\nthe inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions; and\n•\nwe may acquire stores subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the stores and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the stores.\n10\nWe and our vendors rely on information technology, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security incident affecting that technology could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store confidential information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information of our employees, contractors and customers, such as tenant and lease data (collectively, “Confidential Information”). We also rely on third-party vendors for information technology and services, including commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of Confidential Information. Our information technology systems and those of our third-party service providers, strategic partners and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to attack and damage or interruption from computer viruses and malware (e.g. ransomware), misconfigurations, bugs or other vulnerabilities, malicious code, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, hacking, cyberattacks, phishing attacks and other social engineering schemes, employee theft or misuse, human error, fraud, denial or degradation of service attacks, and sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information technology systems and Confidential Information, it is possible that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, safety and security measures, will not be fully implemented, complied with or able to prevent such systems’ improper functioning or damage, or the improper accessing or disclosure of Confidential Information, from such security breaches, disruptions, and shutdowns. The costs associated with the investigation, remediation and potential notification of such breaches to counter-parties and data subjects could be material. \nFrom time to time, we, and certain of our service providers, are subject to cyberattacks and security incidents. While to date, we do not believe that we have experienced any significant system failure, accident or security breach, this risk has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased. Furthermore, because the technologies used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage or disrupt, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. Any failure to maintain the proper functioning, confidentiality, security and availability of our or our third-party service providers' information technology systems or our Confidential Information could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result, subject us to liability and claims or regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, which could result in, among other things, fines and penalties, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\nActual or perceived failures to comply with laws and regulations relating to data privacy and protection could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and our financial condition.\nIn the United States, both federal and various state governments have adopted, or are considering, laws, guidelines or rules for the collection, distribution, use, storage and security of personal information, and we are or may become subject to such obligations with respect to information collected from or about our employees, contractors or customers. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, requires certain businesses that process personal information of California residents to, among other things, provide certain disclosures to California residents regarding the business’s collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information; receive and respond to requests from California residents to access, delete, and correct their personal information, or to opt-out of certain disclosures of their personal information; and enter into specific contractual provisions with service providers that process California resident personal information on the business’s behalf.\nAlthough we work to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, our contractual obligations and other legal obligations, these requirements are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, may conflict with one another or other legal obligations with which we must comply, may require us to incur significant costs, implement new processes, or otherwise affect our ability to use and disclose the information we collect, which could affect our results of operations, business, and financial condition. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our employees, representatives, contractors, consultants, collaborators, or other third parties to comply with such requirements or adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n11\nOur property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes.\nReal property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change. Therefore, the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past, including on a retroactive basis. If our property taxes we pay increase, our cash flow would be adversely impacted, and our ability to pay any expected dividends to our stockholders and unitholders could be adversely affected. \nState and federal regulations relating to natural disasters, public health emergencies or consumer protection could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe impact of natural disasters, public health emergencies and any government responses to such emergencies, or regulations passed in an attempt to protect consumers could lower demand for storage facilities, lead to lower rental rates, inability to raise rents, reduced late fee collection and impaired ability to hold auctions resulting in higher accounts receivable and bad debt. Although the self-storage industry has historically been resilient to ordinary market downturns, the impact of natural disasters, public health emergencies and related regulations including those that limit our ability to raise rents could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nClimate change may adversely affect our results of operations. \nClimate change may cause extreme weather, changes in precipitation and temperature, increases in wild fire risk and rising sea levels in the areas in which we operate which may cause physical damage to our stores or a decrease in demand for rental space in the areas affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected and may negatively impact the types and pricing of insurance we are able to procure. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased operating costs (for example, increased utility costs) and/or increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing stores and could also require us to spend more on our new stores without a corresponding increase in revenue. Further, the impact of climate change may increase the cost of, or make unavailable, property insurance or other hazard insurance on terms we find acceptable or necessary to adequately protect our properties.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nConflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our Operating Partnership.\nConflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, and our Operating Partnership or any partner thereof. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, have fiduciary duties, as a general partner, to our Operating Partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Our duties, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, as a general partner to our Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our Company. The partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our Company or the limited partners in our Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness, and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest.\nAdditionally, the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we, our direct wholly-owned Massachusetts business trust subsidiary, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, nor any of our or their trustees, directors or officers, will be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we, or such trustee, director or officer, acted in good faith. In addition, our Operating Partnership is required to indemnify us, our affiliates and each of our respective trustees, officers, directors, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership, provided that our Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (1) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (2) any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful.\n12\nThe provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement.\nOur joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we held interests in 469 operating stores through joint ventures. Some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers' financial conditions and disputes between us and our co-venturers. We expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into additional joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores. In such event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. The decision-making authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners, is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or is equally shared by us and the joint venture partners. In addition, investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers, which could harm our financial condition.\nWe may record losses as a result of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of the borrowers under our bridge lending program or other companies in which we have invested.  In that case, our revenues and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the total outstanding balance under investments in debt securities and notes receivable was $1.6 billion, including $1.2 billion outstanding under our bridge loan program. Further, as of December 31, 2024, the total outstanding balance of our investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, net of cash distributions, was $1.3 billion, of which $350 million was invested in the preferred stock of entities affiliated with SmartStop. Although we conduct due diligence and aim to carefully evaluate the risks associated with these debt and other investments, we could incur losses from our lending and investing decisions, which includes subjective and complex judgments and forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers and unconsolidated real estate entities to operate their business and/or make all required payments. For example, volatility of the capital and credit markets, increased interest rates, lower demand for storage and general economic conditions may adversely affect the solvency, creditworthiness or operations of our borrowers and entities in which we have invested. If our forecasts prove incorrect, or if any of our borrowers and unconsolidated real estate entities fail to perform as expected, we may incur losses from these investments which could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law and our organizational documents, including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter, may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction.\nOur charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common stock or 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding capital stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit. However, our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. These restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Different ownership limits apply to the family of Kenneth M. Woolley, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing; to Spencer F. Kirk, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing; and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter.\n13\nOur board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nOur charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval. In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.\nMaryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. Our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers.\nRisks Related to Our Debt Financings\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us.\nUncertainty in the credit and financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects. Credit and financial markets can be volatile and may be impacted by diminished liquidity and credit availability, rising interest and inflation rates, declines in economic growth and uncertainty about economic stability as well as geopolitical events such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism, civil unrest and acts of war. A downturn in the credit and financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.\nRequired payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $12.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness. We may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development. We may borrow under our revolving lines of credit and commercial paper program or borrow new funds to finance these future stores. Additionally, we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and, therefore, we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity and/or debt offerings. Further, we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a REIT or to make our expected distributions. To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income each year, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, and we are subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income each year, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and including net capital gains.\nIf we are required to utilize our revolving lines of credit and commercial paper for purposes other than acquisition activity, this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth. Therefore, our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:\n•\nour cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;\n•\nwe may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT;\n14\n•\nwe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity, or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;\n•\nbecause a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense;\n•\nwe may be forced to dispose of one or more of our stores, possibly on disadvantageous terms;\n•\nafter debt service, the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced;\n•\nwe may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns, reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;\n•\nwe may default on our obligations, and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our stores that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases and/or enforce our guarantees;\n•\nwe may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and\n•\nour default under any one of our mortgage loans with cross-default or cross-collateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other stores.\nIncreases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $12.6 billion of debt outstanding, of which approximately $3.0 billion or 24.2% was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). This variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4% per annum. Increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions.\nFailure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements. Hedging involves risks, such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nOur existing indebtedness contains covenants that limit our operating flexibility, and failure to comply with all covenants in our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect us. \nOur debt agreements, including our credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility and term loans and the indentures governing our public traded notes, contain various financial and other covenants that we and our operating partnership must comply with including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, adjusted EBITDA to fixed charged ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt which we must maintain. \nThese covenants may limit our operating flexibility and could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise, growing our business or competing effectively. Our ability to meet these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we fail to meet these requirements, we may be unable to obtain waivers from the lenders or indenture trustee, as applicable, or amend the covenants. \nA breach of any of the covenants or other provisions in our debt agreements could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in such debt becoming due and payable, either automatically or after an election to accelerate by the required percentage of the holders of the indebtedness or by an agent for the holders of the indebtedness. This, in turn, could cause our other debt, including the notes and our revolving credit facility, to become due and payable as a result of cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions contained in the agreements governing the other debt and permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on our assets, if any, that secure this debt. In the event that some or all of our debt is accelerated and becomes immediately due and payable, we may not have the funds to repay or the ability to refinance our debt.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and the market value of our outstanding notes.\nThe credit ratings assigned to the outstanding publicly-traded notes and other debt securities of the Operating Partnership could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that any rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the notes or any other securities. If any credit rating agency that has rated the outstanding notes or other debt securities of the Operating Partnership downgrades or lowers its credit rating, or if any credit rating agency indicates that it has \n15\nplaced any such rating on a so-called “watch list” for a possible downgrading or lowering or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations (including payments on the outstanding notes) and to make dividends and other distributions to our security holders and could also have the material adverse effect on the market value of the outstanding notes.\nRisks Related to Qualification and Operation as a REIT\nDividends payable by REITs may be taxed at higher rates.\nDividends payable by REITs may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of non-REIT corporations. The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for qualified dividends paid by domestic non-REIT corporations to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trust or estates is generally 20%. Dividends paid by REITs to such stockholders are generally not eligible for that rate, but under current tax law, such stockholders may deduct up to 20% of ordinary dividends (i.e., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs, such tax rate may still be higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends. This may cause investors to view REIT investments as less attractive than investments in non-REIT corporations, which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock of REITs, including our stock. In addition, the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends, which could negatively affect the value of our stores.\nPossible legislative or other actions affecting REITs could adversely affect our stockholders.\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us in ways we cannot predict. New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.\nOur failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.\nWe believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT or lose our qualification as a REIT at any time, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because of the following:\n \n•\nwe would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income;\n•\nwe also could be subject to a U.S. federal alternative minimum income tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and\n•\nunless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified.\nIn addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that our U.S. individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates, and our U.S. corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject, in each case, to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code in order to maintain our REIT status, we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of $50,000 or more for each such failure. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code is greater in the case of a REIT that, like us, holds its assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets, the sources of our gross income and the owners \n16\nof our stock. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our ability to satisfy the income tests depends on the sources and amounts of our gross income, which we may not be able to control. Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, and we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including net capital gains. \nWe own and may acquire direct or indirect interests in entities that have elected or will elect to be taxed as REITs under the Internal Revenue Code (each, a “Subsidiary REIT”). A Subsidiary REIT is subject to the various REIT qualification requirements and other limitations described herein that are applicable to us. If a Subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then (i) that Subsidiary REIT would become subject to U.S. federal income tax, (ii) shares in such Subsidiary REIT would cease to be qualifying assets for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs, and (iii) it is possible that we would fail certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs, in which event we would fail to qualify as a REIT unless we could avail ourselves of certain relief provisions.\nIn addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. Although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS regarding our qualification as a REIT.\nWe will pay some taxes, reducing cash available for stockholders.\nEven though we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. Extra Space Management, Inc. manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties. We, jointly with certain corporate subsidiaries, including Extra Space Management, Inc., elected to treat each such subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary (a “TRS”) of our Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A TRS is subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax, and may also be subject to state and local taxes, on its taxable income. ESM Reinsurance Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Extra Space Management, Inc., generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax and pays certain insurance royalties to us. In addition, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants, our TRSs and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties. Also, if we sell property as a dealer (i.e., to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business), we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales. While we do not intend to sell stores as a dealer, the IRS could take a contrary position. To the extent that we are, or any of our TRSs are, required to pay U.S. federal, state or local taxes, we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders.",

    "item1c": "Item 1C.     Cybersecurity\nWe have a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information, which includes a cybersecurity Incident Response Plan (“IRP”). \nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.\nCybersecurity Risk Identification and Management\nWe design and assess our program based on the Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls Version 8 (CIS V8). This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use the CIS V8 controls as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes the following:\n•\nthird party risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n17\n•\na security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n•\nthe use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;\n•\nend-user testing to assess the effectiveness of our security measures; \n•\ncybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management, including mandatory computer-based training, phishing awareness campaigns, and internal communications; \n•\na cybersecurity IRP that includes procedures designed for identifying, analyzing, containing, remedying and otherwise responding to cybersecurity incidents; \n•\ntesting of our incident response readiness through Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan exercises; and\n•\na third-party risk management process for service providers, suppliers, and vendors who have access to our critical systems and information.\nWe have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Our Stores and Operations–We and our vendors rely on information technology, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security incident affecting that technology could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.”\nOur management team, including our Senior Vice President of Information Systems and Vice President of Information Security and Compliance, is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our management team overseeing cybersecurity has over 25+ years of technology and cybersecurity experience, and certain of our team hold various cybersecurity certifications, including the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification. \nOur management team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment. \nWe are able to identify cybersecurity breaches through various channels, including but not limited to automated event detection alerts, reports from employees, notifications from external entities such as third-party IT service providers, and proactive threat investigations in collaboration with our external partners. Upon spotting a potential cybersecurity breach, including those involving third-party cyber events, our designated incident response team outlined in the IRP adheres to the policy's protocols to investigate the suspected incident. This investigation entails determining the nature of the event (e.g., ransomware attack or breach of personal data), evaluating the severity of the incident, and gauging the sensitivity of any compromised data.\nIn the event of a cybersecurity breach, our primary objective is to swiftly contain it by the procedures detailed in our IRP. Once containment is achieved, our focus shifts to remediation and recovery efforts. These actions are tailored to the specifics of the breach and may involve tasks such as rebuilding systems or hosts, replacing compromised files with clean versions, verifying the integrity of affected files or data, enhancing network surveillance or logging to detect future attacks, adjusting administrative account privileges, fortifying network security like firewall configurations, and providing additional training to employees. Additionally, we carry cybersecurity insurance to cover certain expenses associated with security lapses and specified cyber incidents that disrupt our network or those of our vendors, subject to predefined limits and exclusions.\nOur IRP includes clear communication guidelines, outlining procedures for engaging executive management, internal and external legal counsel, the Audit Committee, and the Board. These protocols also encompass a framework for evaluating our regulatory reporting obligations to entities such as the SEC in the aftermath of a cybersecurity incident.\nBoard Oversight of Cybersecurity\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and \noversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.\n In addition, management updates the Board, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential. \nThe Board receives briefings from management on our cyber risk management program on a quarterly basis.\n Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our \nSenior Vice President of Information Systems as well as our Vice President of Information Security and Compliance\n, internal security staff or external experts as part of the Board’s \n18\ncontinuing education on topics that impact public companies. The Audit Committee oversees required disclosures in the event of a cybersecurity breach.\n \nAs part of our board refreshment efforts in recent years, we have added directors with information technology governance skills. Currently, five members of our Board have cybersecurity experience from their principal occupation, other professional experience or third-party director education courses on cybersecurity, including cyber risk governance, and data privacy and security issues and trends."
