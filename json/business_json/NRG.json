    "item1a": "Item 1A — \nRisk Factors\n of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExecutive Summary\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading energy and smart home company fueled by market-leading brands, proprietary technologies and complementary sales channels. Across the U.S. and Canada, NRG delivers innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names such as NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain Energy, and Vivint, while also advocating for competitive energy markets and customer choice. The Company has a customer base that includes approximately 8 million residential customers (comprised of 6 million retail energy customers and 2 million smart home customers) in addition to commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers, supported by approximately 13 GW of generation as of December 31, 2024.\nBusiness Environment\nThe industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company, its businesses, and the retail energy and power generation industry in 2024 and for the future medium term include:\nMarket Dynamics\n — The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, global liquified natural gas demand, exports of natural gas, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas customers and producers. In 2024, the average natural gas price at Henry Hub was $2.27 per MMBtu compared to $2.74 per MMBtu in 2023, representing a decrease of 17%.\nNRG may experience impacts to gross margins due to significant, rapid changes in current natural gas prices, the impact those prices have on power prices, and the lag in its ability to make a corresponding adjustment to the retail rates it charges customers on term and month to month contracts. The Company hedges its load commitments in order to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, and as a result, these gross margin impacts would be realized in future periods until it is able to make the corresponding adjustments to the retail customer rates. \n46\n                                                     \nThe relative price of natural gas as compared to coal and prevailing power prices are the primary driver of coal demand. Coal commodity prices remained relatively flat in 2024.\nElectricity Prices\n — The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company. Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the Company's profitability. An increase in supply cost volatility in the competitive retail markets may result in smaller companies choosing to exit the market, which may result in further consolidation in the competitive retail space. The following table summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates.\n \nAverage On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 vs 2023\nRegion\n2024\n2023\nChange %\nTexas\nERCOT - Houston\n(a)\n$\n32.05 \n$\n74.32 \n(57)\n%\nERCOT - North\n(a)\n30.71 \n72.89 \n(58)\n%\nEast\nNY J/NYC\n(b)\n45.25 \n38.95 \n16 \n%\nNEPOOL\n(b)\n46.59 \n41.36 \n13 \n%\nCOMED (PJM)\n(b)\n31.86 \n32.72 \n(3)\n%\nPJM West Hub\n(b)\n40.75 \n39.34 \n4 \n%\nWest\nCAISO - SP15\n(b)\n29.95 \n60.17 \n(50)\n%\nMISO - Louisiana Hub\n(b)\n30.26 \n33.64 \n(10)\n%\n(a)\nAverage on-peak power prices based on real time settlement prices as published by the respective ISOs\n(b)\nAverage on-peak power prices based on day-ahead settlement prices as published by the respective ISOs\nLoad Growth — \nThe electric industry is expected to experience a surge in demand driven primarily by new manufacturing, industrial and data center facilities (inclusive of GenAI). The U.S. Energy Information Administration's 2023 Annual Energy Outlook, combined with external forecasts of GenAI, shows the potential for 500 TWh of incremental load across the U.S. through 2030, as compared to 2023. ERCOT's current long term load forecast shows peak demand increasing from 86 GW in 2024 to 137 GW in 2028. This load growth will require significant planning and construction of new generation and transmission.\nIncreased Awareness of, and Action to Combat, Climate Change\n — Diverse groups of stakeholders, including investors, asset managers, financial institutions, non-government organizations, industry coalitions, individual companies, consumer groups and academic institutions, are increasingly engaged in efforts to limit global warming in the post-industrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius. As a result, policymakers and regulators at regional, national, sub-national and local levels of government, both in the U.S. and other parts of the world, are increasingly focused on actions to combat climate change. \nNRG actively monitors climate change related developments that could impact its business and regularly engages with a diverse set of stakeholders on these issues. Such engagement helps the Company identify and pursue potential opportunities both to decarbonize its business and better serve its customers. NRG is committed to providing transparent disclosures of its climate risks and opportunities to stakeholders.\nLower Carbon Infrastructure Development\n — Policy mechanisms at the state and federal level, including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans, have supported and continue to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other lower carbon infrastructure technologies. According to ERCOT, 43% of 2024 energy consumption in the ERCOT market was generated from carbon emission-free resources, with wind power contributing 24%. In addition, as subsidies and incentives contribute to increases in renewable power sources, customer awareness and preferences are shifting toward sustainable solutions. Increased demand for sustainable energy products from both residential and commercial customers creates opportunities for diversified product offerings in competitive retail markets.\nDigitization and Customization\n — The electric industry is experiencing major technological changes in the way power is distributed and consumed by end-use customers. The electric grid is shifting from a centralized analog system, where power is generated from limited sources and flows in one direction, to a decentralized multidirectional system, where power can be generated from a number of distributed resources and stored or dispatched on an as-needed basis. In addition, customers are seeking new ways to engage with their power providers. Technologies like smart thermostats, smart appliances and electric vehicles are giving individuals more choice and control over their electricity usage. Power providers are starting to engage with \n47\n                                                     \ncustomers who have transitioned to smart homes with new offerings, including but not limited to behind-the-meter demand response, or virtual power plant products. Companies with large customer bases in competitive marketplaces are poised to create additional engagement with customers to help further integrate their smart home into their daily lives. \nWeather\n \n— Weather conditions in the regions of the U.S. in which NRG conducts business influence the Company's financial results. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels and may also impact the availability of the Company's generating assets. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures and resultant demand are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG's operations are typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once. \nOther Factors\n \n— A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRG's business. These factors include:\n•\nseasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;\n•\nextreme peak demands;\n•\nperformance of renewable generation;\n•\navailable supply resources;\n•\ntransportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;\n•\nlocation of NRG's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;\n•\nprocedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and\n•\nchanges in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.\nThese factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:\n•\nweather conditions;\n•\nmarket liquidity;\n•\ncapability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;\n•\nlocal transportation systems; and\n•\nthe nature and extent of electricity deregulation.\nEnvironmental Matters, Regulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings\n \n— Details of environmental matters are presented in Item 15 — Note 24, \nEnvironmental Matters\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1 \n—\n Business,\n Environmental Matters\n. Details of regulatory matters are presented in Item 15 — Note 23, \nRegulatory Matters\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1 \n—\n Business,\n Regulatory Matters\n.

Proceeds of $500 million were reduced by working capital and other adjustments of $20 million, resulting in net proceeds of $480 million. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of $204 million within the West/Services/Other region of operations.\nCapital Allocation \nIn October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion for share repurchases as part of the existing share repurchase authorization, for a total of $3.7 billion. As of January 31, 2025, $1.5 billion is remaining under the $3.7 billion authorization.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, NRG increased the annual common stock dividend to $1.63 from $1.51 per share, representing an 8% increase from 2023. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, NRG increased the annual common stock dividend by 8% to $1.76 per share. The Company expects to target an annual common stock dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years. \n48\n                                                     \nOn April 16, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Eighth Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Eighth Amendment”) with, among others, Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent (the “Agent”) and as collateral agent, and certain financial institutions, as lenders, which amended the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2016 (as amended, restated, supplemented and/or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”), in order to (i) establish a new Term Loan Facility with borrowings of $875 million in aggregate principal amount\n \n(the “Existing Term Loan B Facility” and the loans thereunder, the “Existing Term Loans”) and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Credit Agreement as set forth therein.

Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's management. Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of retail revenue, energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels, purchased energy and other cost of sales. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, depreciation and amortization, operations and maintenance, or other costs of operations.\nThe following tables present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2024 and

The $209 million gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period, as well as an increase in the value of open positions as a result of increases in natural gas and Northeast power prices. This was partially offset by a decrease in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in CAISO and Alberta power prices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the $144 million gain in revenues from economic hedge positions was driven by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in power prices. The $3.0 billion loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period, as well as a decrease in the value of East and West/Other open positions as a result of decreases in natural gas and power prices. This was partially offset by an increase in the value of Texas open positions as a result of increases in ERCOT power prices.\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

the year ended December 31, 2024, NRG recorded an income tax expense of $323 million on pre-tax income of $1.4 billion. For the same period in 2023, NRG recorded income tax benefit of $11 million on a pre-tax loss of $213 million. The effective tax rate was 22.3% and 5.2% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, NRG's overall effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to permanent differences and state tax expense partially offset by tax benefits from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and decrease of certain state valuation allowances.\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions, except effective income tax rate)\n2024\n2023\nIncome/(Loss) before income taxes\n$\n1,448 \n$\n(213)\nTax at federal statutory tax rate\n304 \n(45)\nState taxes\n92 \n(22)\nForeign rate differential\n1 \n(10)\nChanges in state valuation allowances\n(110)\n42 \nNondeductible loss on Convertible Senior Notes repurchases\n56 \n— \nPermanent differences\n23 \n31 \nStock compensation\n(19)\n— \nRecognition of uncertain tax benefits\n1 \n12 \nDeferred impact of state tax rate changes\n(24)\n3 \nForeign tax refunds\n— \n(17)\nReturn to provision adjustments\n(1)\n(5)\nIncome tax expense/(benefit)\n$\n323 \n$\n(11)\n   Effective income tax rate\n22.3 \n%\n5.2 \n%\nThe effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes\n (\"ASC 740\"). These factors and others, including the Company's history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Position\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, NRG's liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties, was approximately $5.4 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, comprised of the following:\n \nAs of December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n966 \n$\n541 \nRestricted cash - operating \n4 \n21 \nRestricted cash - reserves\n (a)\n4 \n3 \nTotal\n974 \n565 \nTotal availability under Revolving Credit Facility and collective collateral facilities\n(b)\n4,469 \n4,278 \nTotal liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties\n$\n5,443 \n$\n4,843 \n(a)\nIncludes reserves primarily for debt service, performance obligations and capital expenditures\n(b)\nTotal capacity of Revolving Credit Facility and collective collateral facilities was $7.3 billion and $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively\nAs of December 31, 2024, total liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties, increased by $600 million. Changes in cash and cash equivalent balances are further discussed under the heading \nCash Flow Discussion\n. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024, were predominantly held in bank deposits.\n62\n                                                     \nManagement believes that the Company's liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends, and to fund other liquidity commitments in the short and long-term. Management continues to regularly monitor the Company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows includes certain draws from, and payments to, the revolving credit facility and other credit facilities which are not eligible for net reporting. These transactions are for short term liquidity purposes. \nCredit Ratings\nOn March 18, 2024, S&P affirmed the Company's issuer credit rating of BB and changed the rating outlook from Stable to Positive.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's current credit ratings:\n \nS&P\nMoody's\nFitch\nNRG Energy, Inc.\nBB Positive\nBa1 Stable\nBB+ Stable\nSenior Secured Debt\nBBB-\nBaa3\nBBB-\nSenior Unsecured Debt\nBB\nBa2\nBB+\nPreferred Stock\nB\nBa3\nBB-\nLiquidity\nThe principal sources of liquidity for NRG's operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. As described in Item 15 — Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases,\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist mainly of the Senior Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, Senior Secured First Lien Notes, Revolving Credit Facility, the Receivables Securitization Facilities and tax-exempt bonds. The Company also issues letters of credit through bilateral letter of credit facilities and the pre-capitalized trust securities facility.\nThe Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) market operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in Item 15 — Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including maintenance, environmental, and investments and integration; and (iv) allocations in connection with acquisition opportunities, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments to stockholders, as described in Item 15 — Note 15, \nCapital Structure\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSale of Airtron\nOn September 16, 2024, the Company closed on the sale of its 100% ownership in the Airtron business unit. Proceeds of $500 million were reduced by working capital and other adjustments of $20 million, resulting in net proceeds of $480 million. \nSenior Credit Facility\nOn April 16, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Eighth Amendment, which amended the Credit Agreement, in order to (i) establish the Existing Term Loan B Facility with borrowings of $875 million in aggregate principal amount and the Existing Term Loans and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Credit Agreement as set forth therein. The proceeds from the Existing Term Loans were used to repay a portion of the Company’s Convertible Senior notes, all of the Company’s 3.750% senior secured first lien notes due 2024 and for general corporate purposes.\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Ninth Amendment to its Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date of a portion of the revolving commitments thereunder to February 14, 2028. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases.\n63\n                                                     \nDebt Refinancing Transactions\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into the following debt transactions: \nSources\nUses\nIssuance by NRG of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2033\n$925 million\nRepayment of the Vivint Senior Secured Term Loan B\n$1.310 billion\nIssuance by NRG of 6.250% Senior Notes due 2034\n$950 million\nCash tender offer for Vivint 6.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2027\n(a)\n$600 million\nExchange offer for New NRG 5.750% Senior Notes due 2029\n$798 million\nExchange offer for Vivint 5.750% Senior Notes due 2029\n(b)\n$798 million\nIncremental Term Loan B issued by NRG\n$450 million\nRepayment of NRG 6.625% Senior Notes due 2027\n$375 million\nTransactions fees, expenses and premiums\n$40 million\nTotal\n$3.123 billion\nTotal\n$3.123 billion\n(a)\nOn October 15, 2024, APX Group, Inc. launched the Cash Tender Offer for the Vivint 6.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 and on October 30, 2024, delivered a notice of redemption with respect to the $11 million of the Vivint 6.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 that remained outstanding \n(b)\nOn October 15, 2024, APX Group, Inc. launched an Exchange Offer for the Vivint 5.750% Senior Notes due 2029 and on November 4, 2024, delivered a notice of redemption with respect to the $2 million of the Vivint 5.750% Senior Notes due 2029 that remained outstanding following the Exchange Offer \nAs part of the above transactions, the Company entered into the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments to the Credit Agreement to (i) include the Incremental Term Loan B Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $450 million and the Incremental Term Loans, (ii) extend the maturity date of its revolving credit facility to October 30, 2029 and (iii) make certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement. \nOn November 26, 2024, the Company, as borrower, entered into the Twelfth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to (i) reprice both the Existing Term Loan B Facility and the Incremental Term Loan B Facility and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Credit Agreement as set forth therein. \nOn December 20, 2024, the Company, as borrower, entered into the Thirteenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to (i) add APX Group, Inc. as an additional borrower of the loans under the Credit Agreement on a joint and several basis with the Company and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Credit Agreement as set forth therein. For further discussion on these amendments and the debt transactions in the table above, see Item 15 — Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nAs of January 1, 2025, the Company’s Convertible Senior Notes are convertible during the quarterly period ending March 31, 2025 due to the satisfaction of the Common Stock Sale Price Condition. In addition, the Convertible Senior Notes are also convertible from December 1, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before June 1, 2025. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company completed repurchases of a portion of the Convertible Senior Notes using cash on hand and a portion of the proceeds from the Existing Term Loans, as detailed in the table below.

The Capped Calls have a cap price of $249.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments, and effectively lock in a conversion premium of $257 million on the remaining $232 million balance of the Convertible Senior Notes. The option price of $257 million was incurred when the Company entered into the Capped Calls, which will be payable upon the earlier of settlement and expiration of the applicable Capped Calls. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 15, \nCapital Structure\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n64\n                                                     \nReceivables Securitization Facilities\nOn June 21, 2024, NRG Receivables, amended its existing Receivables Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the scheduled termination date to June 20, 2025, (ii) increase the aggregate commitments from $1.4 billion to $2.3 billion (adjusted seasonally) and (iii) add a new originator. As of December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were $1.4 billion in letters of credit issued.\nAlso on June 21, 2024, the Additional Originator entered into the Joinder Agreement to join as Additional Originator to the Receivables Sale Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2020, among Direct Energy, LP, Direct Energy Business, LLC, Green Mountain Energy Company, NRG Business Marketing, LLC, Reliant Energy Northeast LLC, Reliant Energy Retail Services, LLC, Stream SPE, Ltd., US Retailers LLC and XOOM Energy Texas, LLC, as Originators, NRG Retail, as the servicer, and the Receivables Sale Agreement.

These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g. buying power before receiving retail revenues); and (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions. As of December 31, 2024, market operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $309 million and $2.9 billion outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its market activities. As of December 31, 2024, total funds deposited by counterparties were $199 million in cash and $377 million of letters of credit. \nThe Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements related to energy purchases, gas transportation and storage, and fuel and transportation services and generation projects. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had minimum payment obligations under such outstanding agreements of $9.0 billion, with $2.4 billion payable within the next 12 months and an additional $1.5 billion of short-term purchase energy commitments. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 22, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n.\nFuture liquidity requirements may change based on the Company's hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.\nFirst Lien Structure\nNRG has the capacity to grant first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the Company's assets, subject to various exclusions including NRG's assets that have project-level financing and the assets of certain non-guarantor subsidiaries, to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements. The first lien program does not limit the volume that \n66\n                                                     \ncan be hedged or the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. The first lien program also does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.\nThe Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. As of December 31, 2024, all hedges under the first liens were in-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table summarizes the Company's capital expenditures for maintenance, environmental and investments and integration for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n(In millions)\nMaintenance\nEnvironmental\nInvestments and Integration\nTotal\nTexas\n$\n191 \n$\n18 \n$\n160 \n$\n369 \nEast\n— \n3 \n— \n3 \nWest/Services/Other\n15 \n— \n1 \n16 \nVivint Smart Home\n18 \n— \n5 \n23 \nCorporate\n19 \n— \n42 \n61 \nTotal cash capital expenditures for 2024\n243 \n21 \n208 \n472 \nIntegration operating expenses and cost to achieve\n— \n— \n60 \n60 \nInvestments\n— \n— \n180 \n180 \nTotal cash capital expenditures and investments for the year ended December 31, 2024\n$\n243 \n$\n21 \n$\n448 \n$\n712 \nInvestments and Integration for the year ended December 31, 2024 include growth expenditures, integration, small book acquisitions and other investments.\nEnvironmental Capital Expenditures Estimate\nNRG estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2025 through 2029 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $73 million, primarily driven by the cost of complying with ELG at the Company's coal units in Texas.\nThe table below summarizes the status of NRG's coal fleet with respect to air quality controls as of December 31, 2024.

As of January 31, 2025, $1.5 billion is remaining under the $3.7 billion authorization.\nDividend Increase on Common Stock\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, NRG increased the annual dividend on its common stock to $1.63 from $1.51 per share. The Company returned $343 million of capital to common shareholders in the year ended 2024 through a $1.63 dividend per common share. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, NRG increased the annual common stock dividend to $1.76 per share, representing an 8% increase from 2024. The Company expects to target an annual common stock dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years. \nOn January 22, 2025, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.44 per share, or $1.76 per share on an annualized basis, payable on February 18, 2025, to stockholders of record as of February 3, 2025. The Company's common stock dividends are subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws and regulations.\nSeries A Preferred Stock Dividends\nIn March and September 2024, the Company declared and paid semi-annual dividends of $51.25 per share on its outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, each totaling $33 million.\nAdditional Material Cash Requirements Not Discussed Above\nOperating leases \n—\n \nThe Company leases generating facilities, land, office and equipment, railcars, fleet vehicles and storefront space at retail stores. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had lease payment obligations of $292 million, of which $85 million is payable within the next 12 months. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 9, \nLeases\n. \nOther liabilities \n— Other liabilities includes water right agreements, service and maintenance agreements, stadium naming rights, stadium sponsorships, long-term service agreements and other contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had total of $270 million under such commitments,\n \nof which $49 million are payable within the next 12 months.\nContingent obligations for guarantees \n— NRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnifications and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company’s business activities. For further discussion, see Item 15 —Note 26, \nGuarantees\n.\nObligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity\nVariable Interest in Equity investments\n — NRG's investment in Ivanpah is a variable interest entity for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary. See also Item 15 — Note 16, \nInvestments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities,\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. NRG's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt was approximately $461 million as of December 31, 2024. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of Ivanpah to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. \n68\n                                                     \nCash Flow Discussion \n2024 compared to 2023\nThe following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the comparative years: \nYear ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nChange\nCash provided/(used) by operating activities\n$\n2,306 \n$\n(221)\n$\n2,527 \nCash used by investing activities\n(24)\n(910)\n886 \nCash used by financing activities\n(1,755)\n(400)\n(1,355)\nCash provided/(used) by operating activities\nChanges to cash provided/(used) by operating activities were driven by:\n(In millions)\nChanges in cash collateral in support of risk management activities due to change in commodity prices\n$\n2,051 \nIncrease in operating income adjusted for other non-cash items\n645 \nIncrease in working capital primarily due to lower gas pricing coupled with lower gas sales volumes\n341 \nDecrease in working capital primarily driven by capitalized contract costs and deferred revenues\n(396)\nDecrease in working capital primarily related to the payout of the Company's annual incentive plan in 2024 reflecting financial outperformance for 2023\n(114)\n$\n2,527 \nCash used by investing activities \nChanges to cash provided/(used) by investing activities were driven by:\n(In millions)\nDecrease in cash paid for acquisitions primarily due to the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home in March 2023\n$\n2,485 \nDecrease in proceeds from the sale of assets primarily due to the sale of the Company's 44% equity interest in STP in November 2023\n(1,506)\nDecrease in insurance proceeds for property, plant and equipment, net\n(237)\nDecrease in capital expenditures\n126 \nOther\n18 \n$\n886 \nCash (used)/provided by financing activities\nChanges in cash (used)/provided by financing activities were driven by:\n(In millions)\nDecrease due to repayments of long-term debt and finance leases\n$\n(2,732)\nIncrease in proceeds due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2024\n2,469 \nDecrease in proceeds due to the issuance of preferred stock in 2023\n(635)\nDecrease in net receipts from settlement of acquired derivatives\n(345)\nDecrease primarily due to debt extinguishment costs in 2024\n(275)\nIncrease due to less payments for share repurchase activity in 2024  \n187 \nIncrease in payments of dividends primarily due to preferred stock\n(24)\n$\n(1,355)\n69\n                                                     \n NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company had domestic pre-tax book income of $1.5 billion and foreign pre-tax book loss of $37 million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company utilized U.S. federal NOLs of $1.4 billion, and tax credits of $103 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has cumulative U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $7 billion, of which $5.3 billion do not have an expiration date, and cumulative state NOL carryforwards of $6.1 billion for financial statement purposes. NRG also has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $394 million, most of which have no expiration date. In addition to the above NOLs, NRG has a $274 million indefinite carryforward for interest deductions, as well as $269 million of tax credits, inclusive of $61 million of CAMT credits to be utilized in future years. As a result of the Company's tax position, including the utilization of federal and state NOLs, and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates income tax payments, due to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, of up to $125 million in 2025, excluding the impact of the proposed CAMT regulations. As of December 31, 2024, NRG as an applicable corporation is subject to the CAMT, and has reflected the impact in its current and deferred taxes. There is no impact on the Company’s provision for income taxes from the CAMT as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company has $57 million of tax effected uncertain federal, state and foreign tax benefits for which the Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of $62 million (inclusive of accrued interest) until such final resolution with the related taxing authority. \nOn December 31, 2021, the OECD released rules which set forth a common approach to a global minimum tax at 15% for multinational companies, which has been enacted into law by certain countries effective for 2024. The Company's preliminary analysis indicates that there is no material impact to the Company's financial statements from these rules. \nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2021. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2015. \nGuarantor Financial Information\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's outstanding registered senior notes consisted of $821 million of the 2028 Senior Notes as shown in Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases\n. These Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of NRG's current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, or guarantor subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). See Exhibit 22.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of the Guarantors. These guarantees are both joint and several.\nNRG conducts much of its business through and derives much of its income from its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company's ability to make required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the Guarantors to transfer funds to NRG. Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either NRG Energy, Inc. or the Guarantors (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “Non-Guarantors”). The Non-Guarantors include all of NRG's foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with Rule 3-10 under the SEC's Regulation S-X. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations or financial position of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table presents the summarized statement of operations: \n(In millions)\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nRevenue\n(a)\n$\n23,553 \nOperating income\n(b)\n2,382 \nTotal other expense\n(635)\nIncome before income taxes\n1,747 \nNet Income\n1,411 \n(a)\nIntercompany transactions with Non-Guarantors of $5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024\n(b)\nIntercompany transactions with Non-Guarantors including cost of operations of $26 million and selling, general and administrative of $349 million during the year ended December 31, 2024\n70\n                                                     \nThe following table presents the summarized balance sheet information:\n(In millions)\nAs of December 31, 2024\nCurrent assets\n(a)\n$\n6,090 \nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n1,318 \nNon-current assets\n15,208 \nCurrent liabilities\n(b)\n8,181 \nNon-current liabilities\n12,481 \n(a)\nIncludes intercompany receivables due from Non-Guarantors of $30 million as of December 31, 2024\n(b)\nIncludes intercompany payables due to Non-Guarantors that were de minimis as of December 31, 2024 \nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nNRG may enter into energy purchase and sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy-related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel requirements at power plants or retail load obligations. In order to mitigate interest risk associated with the issuance of the Company's variable rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. In addition, in order to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\nUnder Flex Pay, offered by Vivint Smart Home, customers pay for smart home products by obtaining financing from a third-party financing provider under the Consumer Financing Program. Vivint Smart Home pays certain fees to the financing providers and shares in credit losses depending on the credit quality of the customer.\nNRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.\nThe tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n (\"ASC 820\"). Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2024, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2024. For a full discussion of the Company's valuation methodology of its contracts, see \nDerivative Fair Value Measurements\n in Item 15 — Note 5, \nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDerivative Activity Gains\n(In millions)\nFair value of contracts as of December 31, 2023\n$\n648 \nContracts realized or otherwise settled during the period\n165 \nOther changes in fair value\n179 \nFair value of contracts as of December 31, 2024\n(a)\n$\n992 \n(a)\nIncludes $770 million of derivative contracts that were elected as NPNS on October 1, 2024 and are no longer valued at fair value on a recurring basis.

For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 6, \nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A\n — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Commodity Price Risk\n, NRG measures \n71\n                                                     \nthe sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position. As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRG's hedging activity. As of December 31, 2024, NRG's net derivative asset was $992 million, an increase to total fair value of $344 million as compared to December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by gains in fair value and roll-off of trades that settled during the period.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a change of approximately $1.0 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the accounting guidance has not changed.\nNRG evaluates these estimates, on an ongoing basis, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.\n The Company identifies its most critical accounting estimates as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and require the most difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments by management about matters that are inherently uncertain.\n72\n                                                     \nSuch accounting estimates include:\nAccounting Estimate\nJudgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application\nDerivative Instruments\nAssumptions used in valuation techniques\nMarket maturity and economic conditions\nContract interpretation\nMarket conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments\nIncome Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\nInterpret existing tax statute and regulations upon application to transactions\nAbility to utilize tax benefits through carry backs to prior periods and carry forwards to future periods\nJudgement about future realization of deferred tax assets\nEvaluation of Assets for Impairment\nRegulatory and political environments and requirements\nEstimated useful lives of assets\nEnvironmental obligations and operational limitations\nEstimates of future cash flows\nEstimates of fair value\nJudgment about impairment triggering events\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nEstimated useful lives for finite-lived intangible assets\nJudgment about impairment triggering events\nEstimates of reporting unit's fair value\nFair value estimate of intangible assets acquired in business combinations\nBusiness Combinations\nFair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations\nEstimated future cash flow\nEstimated useful lives of assets\nContingencies\nEstimated financial impact of event(s)\nJudgment about likelihood of event(s) occurring\nRegulatory and political environments and requirements\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company follows the guidance of ASC 815, \nDerivatives and Hedging \"(A\nSC 815\"), to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires the Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize fair value change in earnings, unless they qualify for the NPNS exception. ASC 815 applies to NRG's energy related commodity contracts, interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and Consumer Financing Program. \nEnergy-Related Commodities\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, for purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, the Company primarily used quoted exchange prices and consensus pricing. Consensus pricing is provided by independent pricing services which are compiled from market makers with longer dated tenors as compared to broker quotes. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company valued derivatives based on price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate those transactions. The Company started using consensus pricing as it offers data from more market makers and for longer dated tenors as compared to broker quotes, enhances data integrity, and increases transparency. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nNRG is exposed to changes in interest rate through the Company's issuance of variable rate debt. To manage the Company's interest rate risk, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. In order to qualify the derivative instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time period.\n73\n                                                     \nForeign Exchange Contracts\nIn order to mitigate foreign exchange risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\nConsumer Financing Program\nThe derivative positions for the Company's Consumer Financing Program are valued using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates. In summary, the fair value represents an estimate of the present value of the cash flows Vivint Smart Home will be obligated to pay to the third-party financing provider for each component of the derivative.\nCertain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that the Company has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on expected load requirements, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.\nIncome Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets \nAs of December 31, 2024, NRG’s deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. federal and state NOLs, the difference between book and tax basis in property, plant, and equipment, deferred revenues and tax credit carryforwards. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability by tax jurisdiction.\nThe Company evaluates its deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis to determine whether adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate considering changes in facts or circumstances. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, when determining the future realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets. Given the Company’s current level of pre-tax earnings and forecasted future pre-tax earnings, the Company expects to generate income before taxes in the U.S. in future periods at a level that would fully utilize its U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and the majority of its state NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration.\nThe Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of $144 million as of December 31, 2024 against deferred tax assets consisting of state NOL carryforwards and foreign NOL carryforwards in jurisdictions where the Company does not currently believe that the realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's valuation allowance balance was $275 million.\nConsiderable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, including operations located in Australia and Canada.\n \nThe Company continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. \nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2021.\n \nWith few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2015.\nNRG does not intend, nor currently foresee a need, to repatriate funds held at its international operations into the U.S. These funds are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in its foreign operations and the Company has not changed its assertion with respect to distributions of funds that would require the accrual of U.S. income tax.\n74\n                                                     \nEvaluation of Assets for Impairment\nIn accordance with ASC 360, \nProperty, Plant, and Equipment (\"\nASC 360\"), the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events include:\n•\nSignificant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n•\nSignificant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;\n•\nAdverse business climate;\n•\nAccumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amounts originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n•\nCurrent period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n•\nChange in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold, or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nFor assets to be held and used, recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power and natural gas prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, factoring in the different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques, such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\n Assets held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. The Company considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, NRG may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers or employ other valuation techniques. The Company will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or asset. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in NRG's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material. \nAnnually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the Company's fundamental view for long-term prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. Changes to the Company's views of long-term power and fuel prices impact the Company’s projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for its operations and the physical and economic characteristics of each of its businesses.\nFor further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 10\n, \nAsset Impairments\n.\n \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company reported goodwill of $5.0 billion, consisting of $3.5 billion from the acquisition of Vivint in 2023, $1.2 billion from the acquisition of Direct Energy in 2021 and $0.3 billion from other retail acquisitions.\nThe Company applies ASC 805, \nBusiness Combinations\n (\"ASC 805\"), and ASC 350, \nIntangibles-Goodwill and Other (\"\nASC 350\") to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives. Goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit may be below the carrying amount. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, the Company performs a \n75\n                                                     \nquantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing to its book value. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, the Company's goodwill will be impaired at that time.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\nFor further discussion, see \nEvaluation of Assets for Impairment \ncaption above, and Item 15 — Note 10\n, \nAsset Impairments\n.\nBusiness Combinations \nNRG accounts for business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed under ASC 805. Under this method, the Company is required to record on its Consolidated Balance Sheets the estimated fair values of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant estimates and judgments. Fair value is determined based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities from the Vivint Smart Home acquisition that involved the most subjectivity in determining fair value consisted of customer relationships, developed technology, trade names, acquired debt and derivative instruments. NRG describes in detail its acquisitions in Item 15 — Note 4, \nAcquisitions and Dispositions\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe fair value of the customer relationships, technology and trade names are measured using income-based valuation methodologies, which include certain assumptions such as forecasted future cash flows, customer attrition rates, royalty rates and discount rates. Customer relationships and technology are amortized to depreciation and amortization, ratably based on discounted future cash flows. Trade names are amortized to depreciation and amortization, on a straight line basis.\nThe acquired Vivint Smart Home debt was measured at fair value using observable market inputs based on interest rates at the acquisition closing date. The difference between the fair value at the acquisition closing date and the principal outstanding was being amortized through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. On October 30, 2024, the Company repaid in full the outstanding Vivint Term Loans and terminated the revolving credit facility under the Vivint Credit Agreement. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases.\nThe derivative liabilities in connection with the contractual future payment obligations with the financing providers under Vivint Smart Home’s Consumer Financing Program were measured at fair value at the acquisition closing date using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates. Changes to the fair value are recorded each period through other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations. \nContingencies\nNRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 — Note 22, \nCommitments and Contingencies,\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Item 15 — Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments.\n76\n                                                     \nItem 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \nNRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company's normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Company's retail operations, merchant power generation, or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transactions. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks, the Company uses various fixed-price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on NYMEX and other exchanges, and swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter financial markets to:\n•\nManage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;\n•\nReduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices; and\n•\nHedge fuel requirements for the Company's generating facilities.\nCommodity Price Risk\nCommodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities, and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits. NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Company's load servicing obligations and merchant generation operations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of power and fuel. NRG measures the risk of the Company's portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports and VaR. NRG uses a Monte Carlo simulation based VaR model to estimate the potential loss in the fair value of its energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, gas transportation and storage assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions, based on historical and forward values for factors such as customer demand, weather, commodity availability and commodity prices. The Company's VaR model is based on a one-day holding period at a 95% confidence interval for the forward 36 months, not including the spot month. The VaR model is not a complete picture of all risks that may affect the Company's results. Certain events such as counterparty defaults, regulatory changes, and extreme weather and prices that deviate significantly from historically observed values are not reflected in the model.\nThe following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VaR for NRG's commodity portfolio, calculated using the VaR model for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nVaR as of December 31, \n$\n71 \n$\n51 \nFor the year ended December 31,\nAverage\n$\n61 \n$\n62 \nMaximum\n75 \n82 \nMinimum\n50 \n41 \nThe Company also uses VaR to estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark-to-market accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. The VaR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VaR model for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading was $142 million as of December 31, 2024, primarily driven by asset-backed transactions.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. NRG is exposed to counterparty credit risk through various activities including wholesale sales, fuel purchases and retail supply arrangements, and retail customer credit risk through its retail load activities. Counterparty credit risk and retail customer credit risk are discussed below. See Item 15 — Note 6, \nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n, to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion regarding credit risk contingent features. \nCounterparty Credit Risk\nCredit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) a daily monitoring of counterparties' credit limits; (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified \n77\n                                                     \nportfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.\nAs of December 31, 2024, counterparty credit exposure, excluding credit exposure from RTOs, ISOs, registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was $1.7 billion, of which the Company held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $288 million resulting in a net exposure of $1.5 billion. NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately 69% of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of 2026. The following table highlights the net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector and by counterparty credit quality. Net counterparty credit exposure is defined as the aggregate net asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market, NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate credit exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.\nCategory\nNet Exposure \n(a) (b)\n(% of Total)\nUtilities, energy merchants, marketers and other\n74 \n%\nFinancial institutions\n26 \nTotal\n100 \n%\nCategory\nNet Exposure \n(a) (b)\n(% of Total)\nInvestment grade\n55 \n%\nNon-Investment grade/Non-Rated\n45 \nTotal\n100 \n%\n(a)\nCounterparty credit exposure excludes coal transportation contracts because of the unavailability of market prices\n(b)\nThe figures in the tables above exclude potential counterparty credit exposure related to RTOs, ISOs, registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term contracts\nThe Company had no exposure to wholesale counterparties in excess of 10% of the total net exposure discussed above as of December 31, 2024. Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration.\nRTOs and ISOs\nThe Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, AESO, IESO, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in the majority of these markets is approved by FERC, whereas in the case of ERCOT, it is approved by the PUCT, and whereas in the case of AESO and IESO, both exist provincially with AESO primarily subject to Alberta Utilities Commission and the IESO subject to the Ontario Energy Board. These ISOs may include credit policies that, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. As a result, the counterparty credit risk to these markets is limited to NRG’s share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.\nExchange Traded Transactions\nThe Company enters into commodity transactions on registered exchanges, notably ICE, NYMEX and Nodal. These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.\nLong-Term Contracts\nCounterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long-term contracts, primarily solar under Renewable PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Based on these valuation techniques, as of December 31, 2024, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately $868 million for the next five years. \nRetail Customer Credit Risk\n \nNRG is exposed to retail credit risk through the Company's retail electricity and gas providers as well as through Vivint Smart Home. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the loss of in-the-money forward value. The Company manages retail \n78\n                                                     \ncredit risk through the use of established credit policies, which include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's retail customer credit exposure to Home and Business customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in credit losses. The Company's provision for credit losses resulting from credit risk was $314 million, $251 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for credit losses included the Company's loss mitigation efforts recognized as income of $126 million related to Winter Storm Uri.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company's activities and the management of the Company's assets and liabilities. The Company is currently exposed to additional collateral posting if natural gas prices decline, primarily due to the long natural gas equivalent position at various exchanges used to hedge NRG's retail supply load obligations.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions under marginable contracts as of December 31, 2024, a $0.50 per MMBtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the marginable contracts would cause an increase in margin collateral posted of approximately $1.1 billion and a 1.00 MMBtu/MWh decrease in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in an increase in margin collateral posted of approximately $359 million. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract provisions as of December 31, 2024.\nInterest Rate Risk\nNRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through its issuance of variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combinations of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. NRG's risk management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. In November 2024, the Company entered into $700 million of interest rate swaps through 2029 to hedge the floating rate on the Term Loans.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's debt fair value was $10.8 billion and carrying value was $10.9 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Company's long-term debt by $465 million.\nCurrency Exchange Risk\nNRG is subject to transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the U.S., primarily within Canada, as well as from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the Company's functional currency or the functional currency of an applicable subsidiary. NRG hedges a portion of its forecasted currency transactions with foreign exchange forward contracts. As of December 31, 2024, NRG is exposed to changes in foreign currency primarily associated with the purchase of U.S. dollar denominated natural gas for its Canadian business and entered into foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $410 million.\nThe Company is subject to translation exchange rate risk related to the translation of the financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian and Australian dollars. A hypothetical 10% appreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2024, would have resulted in a decrease of $3 million to net income within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nItem 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe financial statements and schedules are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 9 — Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\n79\n                                                     \nItem 9A — Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of NRG's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm are incorporated under the caption \"Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\" and under the caption \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in NRG’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NRG’s internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nNRG's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n1.\nPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets;\n2.\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and\n3.\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in\n Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company's evaluation under the framework in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n, the Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of the\n Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n80\n                                                     \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nNRG Energy, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n.\n In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 26, 2025 \n81\n                                                     \nItem 9B — Other Information\nDirector and Officer Trading Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, no director or officer of the Company \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n a 'Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement' or 'non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,' as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C — Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\n82\n                                                     \nPART III\nItem 10 — Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nDirectors and Executive Officers\nInformation required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the similarly named section of NRG's Definitive Proxy Statement for its 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nCode of Ethics\nNRG has adopted a code of ethics entitled \"NRG Code of Conduct\" that applies to directors, officers and employees, including the chief executive officer and senior financial officers of NRG.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control \n–\n Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenues\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had $28,130 million of revenues. Revenue is derived from various revenue streams in different geographic markets and the Company’s processes and related information technology (IT) systems used to record revenue differ for each of these revenue streams.\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenues as a critical audit matter which required a high degree of auditor judgment due to the number of revenue streams and IT systems involved in the revenue recognition process. This included determining the revenue streams over which procedures were to be performed and evaluating the nature and extent of evidence obtained over the individual revenue streams as well as revenue in the aggregate. It also included the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the performance of certain procedures.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We, with the assistance of IT professionals, applied auditor judgment to determine the revenue streams over which procedures were performed as well as the nature and extent of such procedures. For certain revenue streams over which procedures were performed, \n86\n                                                     \nwe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s revenue recognition processes. For certain revenue streams, we involved IT professionals, who assisted in testing certain IT applications used by the Company in its revenue recognition processes. In addition, we assessed recorded revenue for a selection of transactions by comparing the amounts recognized to underlying documentation, including contracts with customers, and for certain revenue streams, we performed a software-assisted data analysis to assess certain relationships among revenue transactions. In addition, we evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenues by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of such evidence.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2004.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 26, 2025\n87\n                                                     \nNRG ENERGY, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 — \nNature of Business\n \nGeneral\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading energy and smart home company fueled by market-leading brands, proprietary technologies, and complementary sales channels. Across the United States and Canada, NRG delivers innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names such as NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain Energy and Vivint, while also advocating for competitive energy markets and customer choice. The Company has a customer base that includes approximately \n8\n million residential customers (comprised of \n6\n million retail energy customers and \n2\n million smart home customers) in addition to commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers, supported by approximately \n13\n GW of generation as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company's business is segmented as follows:\n•\nTexas, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in Texas, other than Cottonwood; \n•\nEast, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the East; \n•\nWest/Services/Other, which includes the following assets and activities: (i) all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the West and Canada, and (ii) activity related to the Cottonwood facility and other investments;\n•\nVivint Smart Home; and\n•\nCorporate activities.\n \nNote 2 — \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n \nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The ASC, established by the FASB, is the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities. In addition, the rules and interpretative releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants.\nThe consolidated financial statements include NRG's accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling interest. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity. However, a controlling financial interest may also exist through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. As such, NRG applies the guidance of ASC 810, \nConsolidations,\n or ASC 810, to determine when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or not controlled through its voting interests, referred to as a VIE, should be consolidated.\nPresentation Adjustments\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2024, the Company is recording the amortization of capitalized contracts costs within depreciation and amortization. This change, along with additional financial statement disclosures, is meant to address investor inquiries by enhancing transparency to easier match expenses with revenues. NRG previously recorded amortization of capitalized contract costs related to fulfillment in cost of operations and amortization of capitalized contract costs related to customer acquisition primarily in selling, general and administrative costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Prior years amounts were adjusted for comparative purposes. The adjustments had no impact on the Company’s total operating costs and expenses, and total cash flows.\n95\n                                                     \nThe following table presents adjustments within the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 related to capitalized contract costs:\n(In millions)\nAs Previously Presented\nPresentation Adjustments\nAs Adjusted\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nCost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below)\n$\n26,526\n \n$\n(\n43\n)\n$\n26,483\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n1,127\n \n168\n \n1,295\n \nSelling, general and administrative costs\n1,968\n \n(\n125\n)\n1,843\n \nYear ended December 31, 2022\nCost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below)\n$\n27,446\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n27,443\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n634\n \n86\n \n720\n \nSelling, general and administrative costs\n1,228\n \n(\n83\n)\n1,145\n \nThe following table presents adjustments within the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 related to capitalized contract costs:\n(In millions)\nAs Previously Presented\nPresentation Adjustments\nAs Adjusted\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nCash flows from operating activities:\nAmortization of capitalized contract costs\n$\n—\n \n$\n168\n \n$\n168\n \nPrepayments and other current assets\n(\n233\n)\n(\n168\n)\n(\n401\n)\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nCash flows from operating activities:\nAmortization of capitalized contract costs\n$\n—\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n86\n \nPrepayments and other current assets\n17\n \n(\n86\n)\n(\n69\n)\nWinter Storm Uri Uplift Securitization Proceeds\nIn May 2021, the Texas Legislature passed House Bill (“HB”) 4492 to mitigate exceptionally high price adders and ancillary service costs incurred by ERCOT LSEs during Winter Storm Uri. HB 4492 authorized ERCOT to obtain $2.1 billion of financing to distribute to LSEs that were charged and paid to ERCOT those highly priced ancillary service and online reliability deployment price adders during Winter Storm Uri. \nIn December 2021, ERCOT filed with the PUCT a calculation of each LSE’s share of proceeds based on the settlement methodology. The Company accounted for the proceeds by analogy to the contribution model within ASC 958-605, \nNot-for-Profit Entities- Revenue Recognition\n and the grant model within IAS 20, \nAccounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance\n, as a reduction to expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the 2021 annual period for which the proceeds were intended to compensate. In June 2022, the Company received proceeds of $\n689\n million from ERCOT in relation with HB 4492.\nCredit Losses\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2016-13, \nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n, or ASU No. 2016-13, retail trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet net of the allowance for credit losses within accounts receivables, net. Long-term receivables are recorded net in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company accrues an allowance for current expected credit losses based on (i) estimates of uncollectible revenues by analyzing accounts receivable aging and current and reasonable forecasts of expected economic factors including, but not limited to, unemployment rates and weather-related events, (ii) historical collections and delinquencies, and (iii) counterparty credit ratings for commercial and industrial customers. The Company writes off customer contract receivable balances against the allowance for credit losses when it is determined a receivable is uncollectible.\n96\n                                                     \nThe following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022: \nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n145\n \n$\n133\n \n$\n683\n \nAcquired balance from Vivint Smart Home\n—\n \n22\n \n—\n \nProvision for credit losses\n(a)\n314\n \n251\n \n11\n \nWrite-offs\n(\n363\n)\n(\n313\n)\n(\n593\n)\nRecoveries collected\n38\n \n39\n \n32\n \nOther\n18\n \n13\n \n—\n \nEnding balance\n(a)\n$\n152\n \n$\n145\n \n$\n133\n \n(a)\nIncludes bilateral finance hedging risk of $(\n70\n) million accounted for under ASC 815 for the year ended\n \nDecember 31, 2022\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for credit losses included the Company's loss mitigation efforts recognized as income of $\n126\n million related to Winter Storm Uri. The increase in write-offs during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the resolution of credit losses that occurred during Winter Storm Uri. \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.\nFunds Deposited by Counterparties\nFunds deposited by counterparties consist of cash held by the Company as a result of collateral posting obligations from its counterparties related to NRG's hedging program. The increase in funds deposited by counterparties is driven by the increase in forward positions as a result of increases in natural gas and power prices compared to December 31, 2023. Though some amounts are segregated into separate accounts, not all funds are contractually restricted. Based on the Company's intention, these funds are not available for the payment of general corporate obligations; however, they are available for liquidity management. Depending on market fluctuations and the settlement of the underlying contracts, the Company will refund this collateral to the hedge counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades. Since collateral requirements fluctuate daily and the Company cannot predict if any collateral will be held for more than \ntwelve\n months, the funds deposited by counterparties are classified as a current asset on the Company's balance sheet, with an offsetting liability for this cash collateral received within current liabilities.\nRestricted Cash\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and funds deposited by counterparties reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows.\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n966\n \n$\n541\n \n$\n430\n \nFunds deposited by counterparties\n199\n \n84\n \n1,708\n \nRestricted cash\n8\n \n24\n \n40\n \nCash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties and restricted cash shown in the statements of cash flows\n$\n1,173\n \n$\n649\n \n$\n2,178\n \nRestricted cash consists primarily of funds held within the Company's projects that are restricted in their use.\nInventory\nInventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market, and consists principally of natural gas, fuel oil, coal, spare parts and finished goods. The Company removes natural gas inventory as goods are delivered to customers and as they are used in the production of electricity or steam. The Company removes fuel oil and coal inventories as they are used in the production of electricity. The Company removes spare parts inventories when they are used for repairs, maintenance or capital projects. The Company expects to recover the natural gas, fuel oil, coal and spare parts costs in the ordinary course of business. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on a first in first out basis for finished goods and weighted average cost method for all other inventories. The Company removes finished goods inventories as they are \n97\n                                                     \nsold to customers. Inventories sold to customers as part of a smart home system are generally capitalized as contract costs. Sales of inventory are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of business acquisitions, acquisition date fair value; however, impairment adjustments are recorded whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized as incurred, while repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation, other than nuclear fuel, is computed using the straight-line method, while nuclear fuel was amortized based on units of production over the estimated useful lives. Certain assets and their related accumulated depreciation amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in cost of operations in the consolidated statements of operations. For further discussion, see Note 8, \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n.\nBusiness Interruption Insurance\nThe Company carries insurance policies to cover insurable risks including, but not limited to, business interruption.\n There were no business interruption insurance settlements during the year ended December 31, 2024. As a result of damage at the Limestone 1 and W.A. Parish 8 units, the Company recorded business interruption insurance settlements of $\n7\n million and $\n81\n million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Business interruption insurance is recorded to cost of operations in the consolidated statements of operations and cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nAsset Impairments\nLong-lived assets that are held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are performed in accordance with ASC 360. An impairment loss is indicated if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from an asset are less than its carrying value. An impairment charge is measured by the difference between an asset's carrying amount and fair value with the difference recorded in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Fair values are determined by a variety of valuation methods, including third-party appraisals, sales prices of similar assets and present value techniques. \nInvestments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 323, \nInvestments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures\n, or ASC 323, which requires that a loss in value of an investment that is an other-than-temporary decline should be recognized. The Company identifies and measures losses in the value of equity method investments based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value. For further discussion of these matters, refer to Note 10, \nAsset Impairments\n.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest expense on a basis that approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, or as an asset if the issuance costs relate to revolving debt agreements or certain other financing arrangements.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets represent contractual rights held by the Company. The Company recognizes specifically identifiable intangible assets including emissions allowances, customer and supply contracts, customer relationships, marketing partnerships, technologies, trade names and fuel contracts when specific rights and contracts are acquired. These intangible assets are amortized based on expected volumes, expected delivery, expected discounted future net cash flows, straight line or units of production basis. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had accumulated amortization related to its intangible assets of $\n3.6\n billion and $\n3.0\n billion, respectively.\nEmission allowances held-for-sale, which are included in other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, are not amortized; they are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.\nFor further discussion, see Note 11, \nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\n.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with ASC 350, \nIntangibles-Goodwill and Other\n, or ASC 350, the Company recognizes goodwill for the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n98\n                                                     \nThe Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, there is no goodwill impairment.\nIn the absence of sufficient qualitative factors indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that no impairment occurred, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between book value and fair value.\nFor further discussion of goodwill impairment losses recognized refer to Note 10, \nAsset Impairments\n.\nCapitalized Contract Costs\nCapitalized contract costs represent the costs directly related and incremental to the origination of new contracts, modification of existing contracts or to the fulfillment of the related customer contracts. These costs include installed products, commissions, other compensation and the cost of installation of new or upgraded customer contracts. The Company calculates amortization by accumulating all deferred contract costs into separate portfolios based on the initial month of service and amortizes those deferred contract costs on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, consistent with the pattern in which the Company provides services to its customers. The expected period of benefit for customers is approximately \nfive years\n. The Company updates its estimate of the expected period of benefit periodically and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the expected period of benefit could change significantly. Such changes, if any, are accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate. Amortization of capitalized contract costs are included in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. Contract costs not directly related and incremental to the origination of new contracts, modification of existing contracts or to the fulfillment of the related customer contracts are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation and Amortization \nThe Company's depreciation and amortization included in the consolidated statement of operations consisted of the following:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmortization of capitalized contract costs related to fulfillment\n$\n120\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n—\n \nAmortization of capitalized contract costs related to customer acquisition\n212\n \n131\n \n86\n \nAmortization of customer relationships and other intangible assets\n800\n \n870\n \n343\n \nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\n271\n \n257\n \n291\n \nTotal depreciation and amortization\n$\n1,403\n \n$\n1,295\n \n$\n720\n \nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes,\n or ASC 740, which requires that the Company use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant temporary differences.\nThe Company has two categories of income tax expense or benefit — current and deferred, as follows:\n•\nCurrent income tax expense or benefit consists solely of current taxes payable less applicable tax credits, and\n•\nDeferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income\nThe Company reports some of its revenues and expenses differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax return purposes, resulting in temporary and permanent differences between the Company's financial statements and income tax returns. The tax effects of such temporary differences are recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income tax liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company measures its deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the deferred tax is realized. \nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which applies to all tax positions related to income taxes. Under ASC 740, tax benefits are recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the authorities. The benefit recognized from a position is the amount of benefit that has \n99\n                                                     \nsurpassed the more-likely-than-not threshold, as it is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nIn accordance with ASC 740 and as discussed further in Note 19, \nIncome Taxes\n, changes to existing net deferred tax assets or valuation allowances or changes to uncertain tax benefits, are recorded to income tax expense/(benefit).\nContract and Emission Credit Amortization \nAssets and liabilities recognized through acquisitions related to the purchase and sale of energy and energy-related products in future periods for which the fair value has been determined to be significantly less or more than market are amortized to revenues or cost of operations over the term of each underlying contract based on actual generation and/or contracted volumes. \nEmission credits represent the right to emit a specified amount of certain pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide, over a compliance period. Emission credits held for use are amortized to cost of operations based on the weighted average cost of the allowances held.\nGross Receipts and Sales Taxes\nIn connection with its retail sales, the Company records gross receipts taxes on a gross basis in revenues and cost of operations in its consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company's revenues and cost of operations included gross receipts taxes of $\n216\n million, $\n212\n million, and $\n218\n million, respectively. Additionally, the Company records sales taxes collected from its taxable retail customers and remitted to the various governmental entities on a net basis; thus, there is no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\nCost of Operations\nCost of operations includes cost of fuel, purchased energy and other costs of sales, mark-to-market for economic hedging activities, contract and emission credit amortization, operations and maintenance, and other cost of operations.\nCost of Fuel, Purchased Energy and Other Cost of Sales\nCost of fuel is primarily the costs associated with procurement, transportation and storage of natural gas, nuclear fuel, oil and coal to operate the generation portfolio, which is expensed as the fuel is consumed. Purchased energy primarily relates to purchases to supply the Company's customer base, which includes spot market purchases, as well as contracts of various quantities and durations, including Renewable PPAs with third-party developers, which are primarily accounted for as NPNS (see further discussion in Derivative Instruments below). Other cost of sales primarily consists of TDSP expenses.\nThe cost of fuel is based on actual and estimated fuel usage for the applicable reporting period. The cost to deliver energy and related services to customers is based on actual and estimated supply volumes for the applicable reporting period. A portion of the cost of energy, $\n284\n million, $\n240\n million, and $\n202\n million as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, was accrued and consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities. \nIn estimating supply volumes, the Company considers the effects of historical customer volumes, weather factors and usage by customer class. Transmission and distribution delivery fees are estimated using the same method used for electricity sales and services to retail customers. In addition, ISO fees are estimated based on historical trends, estimated supply volumes and initial ISO settlements. Volume estimates are then multiplied by the supply rate and recorded as cost of operations in the applicable reporting period.\nVivint Smart Home Flex Pay\nUnder the Flex Pay plan (“Flex Pay”), offered by Vivint Smart Home, customers pay separately for smart home products and services (smart home and security). The customer has the ability to pay for Vivint Smart Home products in the following three ways: (i) qualified customers may finance the purchase through third-party financing providers (\"Consumer Financing Program\" or “CFP”), (ii) Vivint Smart Home generally offers a limited number of customers not eligible for the CFP, but who qualify under Vivint Smart Home underwriting criteria, the option to enter into a retail installment contract directly with Vivint Smart Home or (iii) customers may conduct purchases by check, automatic clearing house payments, credit or debit card or by obtaining short-term financing (generally no more than \nsix-month\n installment terms) through Vivint Smart Home. \nAlthough customers pay separately for products and services under Flex Pay, the Company has determined that the sale of products and services are \none\n single performance obligation resulting in deferred revenue for the gross amount of products sold. For products financed through the CFP, gross deferred revenues are reduced by (i) any fees the third-party financing provider (“Financing Provider”) is contractually entitled to receive at the time of loan origination, and (ii) the present value of expected future payments due to the Financing Providers\n. \nLoans are issued on either an installment or revolving basis with repayment terms ranging from \n6\n to \n60\n months.\n100\n                                                     \nFor certain Financing Provider loans:\n•\nVivint Smart Home pays a monthly fee based on either the average daily outstanding balance of the installment loans, or the number of outstanding loans.\n•\nVivint Smart Home incurs fees at the time of the loan origination and receives proceeds that are net of these fees.\n•\nVivint Smart Home also shares liability for credit losses.\n•\nVivint Smart Home is responsible for reimbursing certain Financing Providers for merchant transaction fees and other associated loan fees.\nDue to the nature of these provisions, the Company records a derivative liability (\"CFP Derivative\") at its fair value when the Financing Provider originates loans to customers, which reduces the amount of estimated revenue recognized on the provision of the services. The derivative liability is reduced as payments are made by Vivint Smart Home to the Financing Provider. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the derivative liability are realized through other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. For further discussion, see Note 6, \nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments under ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value in earnings, unless they qualify for the NPNS exception. The Company's primary derivative instruments are power and natural gas purchase or sales contracts, fuels purchase contracts, the CFP and other energy related commodities used to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuation in market prices. In order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Company's variable rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. In addition, in order to mitigate foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.\nRevenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is delivered. While these contracts are considered derivative instruments under ASC 815, they are not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings.\nNRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in earnings.\nMark-to-Market for Economic Hedging Activities\nNRG enters into derivative instruments to manage price and delivery risk, optimize physical and contractual assets in the portfolio and manage working capital requirements. The mark-to-market for economic hedging activities are recognized to revenues or cost of operations during the reporting period.\nOperations and Maintenance and Other Cost of Operations\nOperations and maintenance costs include major and other routine preventative (planned outage) and corrective (forced outage) maintenance activities to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the Company's generation portfolio in compliance with all local, state and federal requirements. Operations and maintenance costs are also costs associated with retaining and maintaining the Company's customer base, such as call center support, portfolio maintenance and data analytics. Other cost of operations primarily includes gross receipts taxes, insurance, property taxes and asset retirement obligation expense.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses\nThe local currencies are generally the functional currency of NRG's foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated at the weighted-average rates of exchange for the period. The resulting currency translation adjustments are not included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period, but are accumulated and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign entity takes place. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are reported within other income, net in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\n For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, amounts recognized as foreign currency transaction gains/(losses) were immaterial. The Company's cumulative translation adjustment balances as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $(\n72\n) million, $(\n43\n) million, and $(\n55\n) million, respectively.\n101\n                                                     \nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trust funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, derivatives and investments in debt securities. Trust funds are held in accounts managed by experienced investment advisors. Certain accounts receivable, notes receivable, and derivative instruments are concentrated within entities engaged in the energy industry. These industry concentrations may impact the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Receivables and other contractual arrangements are subject to collateral requirements under the terms of enabling agreements. However, the Company believes that the credit risk posed by industry concentration is offset by the diversification and creditworthiness of its customer base. See Note 5, \nFair Value of Financial Instruments,\n for a further discussion of derivative concentrations.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company accounts for AROs in accordance with ASC 410-20, \nAsset Retirement Obligations,\n or ASC 410-20. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of ASC 410-20 are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes, and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and for which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. ASC 410-20 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.\nUpon initial recognition of a liability for an ARO, the Company capitalizes the asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount. Over time, the liability is accreted to its future value, while the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. See Note 13, \nAsset Retirement Obligations,\n for a further discussion of AROs.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe Company offers pension benefits through a defined benefit pension plan. In addition, the Company provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of employees. The Company accounts for pension and other postretirement benefits in accordance with ASC 715, \nCompensation — Retirement Benefits\n, or ASC 715\n.\n The Company recognizes the funded status of the Company's defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position and records an offset for gains and losses as well as all prior service costs that have not been included as part of the Company's net periodic benefit cost to other comprehensive income. The determination of the Company's obligation and expenses for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions. These assumptions determined by management include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases. The Company's actuarial consultants assist in determining assumptions for such items as retirement age. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.\nThe Company measures the fair value of its pension assets in accordance with ASC 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\n or ASC 820. For further discussion, see Note 14, \nBenefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\n.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, \nCompensation — Stock Compensation,\n or ASC 718\n.\n The fair value of the Company's performance stock units is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model. NRG uses the Company's common stock price on the date of grant as the fair value of the Company's deferred stock units. Forfeiture rates are estimated based on an analysis of the Company's historical forfeitures, employment turnover, and expected future behavior. The Company recognizes compensation expense for both graded and cliff vesting awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For further discussion, see Note 20, \nStock-Based Compensation\n.\nInvestments Accounted for by the Equity Method\nThe Company has investments in domestic energy projects, as well as one Australian project. The equity method of accounting is applied to such investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents the Company from exercising a controlling influence over the operating and financial policies of the projects. Under this method, equity in pre-tax income or losses of domestic partnerships and, generally, in the net income or losses of its Australian project, are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Distributions from equity method investments that represent earnings on the Company's investment are included within cash flows from operating activities and distributions from equity method investments that represent a return of the Company's investment are included within cash flows from investing activities. For further discussion, see Note 16, \nInvestments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities\n.\n102\n                                                     \nSale-Leaseback Arrangements\nNRG is party to sale-leaseback arrangements that provide for the sale of certain assets to a third-party and simultaneously leases back the same asset to the Company. If the seller-lessee transfers control of the underlying assets to the buyer-lessor, the arrangement is accounted for under ASC 842-40, \nSale-Leaseback Transactions\n. These arrangements are classified as operating leases on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\n \nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nThe Company expenses its marketing and advertising costs as incurred and includes them within selling, general and administrative costs. The costs of tangible assets used in advertising campaigns are recorded as fixed assets or deferred advertising costs and amortized as advertising costs over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the advertising campaign. The Company has several long-term sponsorship arrangements. Payments related to these arrangements are deferred and expensed over the term of the arrangement.\n Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $\n215\n million, $\n185\n million, and $\n82\n million, respectively. \nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, \nBusiness Combinations,\n or ASC 805, which requires an acquirer to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company also recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase in the business combination. In addition, transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. \nIn recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, the Company uses estimates based on the best information available. Estimates are used for such items as plant depreciable lives, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts, actuarially determined benefit costs, the valuation of energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities, legal costs incurred in connection with recorded loss contingencies, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of impaired assets. As better information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect results from operations, net assets or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Developments - Guidance Adopted in 2024\nASU 2023-07\n – In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n, or ASU 2023-07. The guidance in ASU 2023-07 enhances reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. The Company adopted the amendments effective December 31, 2024. Because the amendments update disclosure requirements only, it did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, or statement of financial position.\nRecent Accounting Developments - Guidance Not Yet Adopted\nASU 2023-09\n – In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740) – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, or ASU 2023-09. The guidance in ASU 2023-09 enhances income tax disclosures by requiring disclosure of specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation and additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Further, the amendments of ASU 2023-09 require certain disclosures on income tax expense and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments of ASU 2023-09 may be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on its disclosures.\nASU 2024-03\n – In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03,\n Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) – Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n, or ASU \n103\n                                                     \n2024-03. The guidance in ASU 2024-03 requires more detailed information about specified categories of expenses included in certain captions presented on the face of the income statement. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or (2) retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03 on its disclosures.\nASU 2024-04\n – In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-04,\n Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) – Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments\n, or ASU 2024-04. The guidance in ASU 2024-04 clarifies the requirements related to accounting for the settlement of a debt instrument as an induced conversion when changes are made to conversion features as part of an offer to settle the instrument. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The amendments may be applied either (1) prospectively to any settlements of convertible debt instruments that occur after the effective date of this ASU or (2) retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements, with a cumulative adjustment-effect adjustment to equity. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-04 on its disclosures.\nNote 3\n \n— \nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's policies with respect to its various revenue streams are detailed below. The Company generally applies the invoicing practical expedient to recognize revenue for the revenue streams detailed below, except in circumstances where the invoiced amount does not represent the value transferred to the customer.\nRetail Revenue\nGross revenues for energy sales and services to retail customers are recognized as the Company transfers the promised goods and services to the customer. Payment terms are generally \n15\n to \n60\n days. For the majority of its electricity and natural gas contracts, the Company’s performance obligation with the customer is satisfied over time and performance obligations for its electricity and natural gas products are recognized as the customer takes possession of the product. The Company also allocates the contract consideration to distinct performance obligations in a contract for which the timing of the revenue recognized is different. Additionally, customer discounts and incentives reduce the contract consideration and are recognized over the term of the contract.\nEnergy sales and services that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated. Accrued unbilled revenues are based on estimates of customer usage since the date of the last meter reading provided by the independent system operators, utilities, or electric distribution companies. Volume estimates are based on daily forecasted volumes and estimated customer usage by class. Unbilled revenues are calculated by multiplying these volume estimates by the applicable rate by customer class. Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed.\nAs contracts for retail electricity and natural gas can be for multi-year periods, the Company has performance obligations under these contracts that have not yet been satisfied. These performance obligations have transaction prices that are both fixed and variable, and that vary based on the contract duration, customer type, inception date and other contract-specific factors. For the fixed price contracts, the amount of any unsatisfied performance obligations will vary based on customer usage, which will depend on factors such as weather and customer activity and therefore it is not practicable to estimate such amounts.\nVivint Smart Home Retail Revenue\nVivint Smart Home offers its customers combinations of smart home products and services, which together create an integrated smart home system that allows the Company's customers to monitor, control and protect their homes. As the products and services included in the customer's contract are integrated and highly interdependent, and because the products (including installation) and services must work together to deliver the monitoring, controlling and protection of their home, the Company has concluded that the products and services contracted for by the customer are generally not distinct within the context of the contract and, therefore, constitute a single, combined performance obligation. Revenues for this single, combined performance obligation are recognized on a straight-line basis over the customer's contract term, which is the period in which the parties to the contract have enforceable rights and obligations. The Company has determined that certain contracts that do not require a long-term commitment for monitoring services by the customer contain a material right to renew the contract, because the customer does not have to purchase the products upon renewal. Proceeds allocated to the material right are recognized over the expected period of benefit. The majority of Vivint Smart Home's subscription contracts are \nfive years\n and are generally non-cancelable. These contracts generally convert into month-to-month agreements at the end of the initial term, while some customers are month-to-month from inception. Payment for Vivint Smart Home services is generally due in advance on a monthly basis, with payment terms up to \n30\n days. Product sales and other one-time fees are invoiced to customers at time of sale. Revenues for any products or services that are considered separate performance obligations are recognized upon delivery. Payments received or billed in advance are reported as deferred revenues. \n104\n                                                     \nEnergy Revenue\nBoth physical and financial transactions consist of revenues billed to a third-party at either market or negotiated contract terms to optimize the financial performance of the Company's generating facilities. Payment terms vary from \n5\n to \n55\n days. Electric energy revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer over time, using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations. Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to meet supply and demand, are recorded on a gross basis in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company applies the invoicing practical expedient in recognizing energy revenue. Under the practical expedient, revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is equal to the value to the customer of NRG’s performance obligation completed to date. Financial transactions used to hedge the sale of electricity are recorded net within revenues in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with ASC 815.\nAncillary revenues, included in Other revenue, are recognized over time as the obligation is fulfilled, using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations.\nCapacity\n \nRevenue\nThe Company's largest sources of capacity revenues are capacity auctions in PJM and NYISO. Capacity revenues also include revenues billed to a third-party at either market or negotiated contract terms for making installed generation and demand response capacity available in order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements. Payment terms vary from \n15\n to \n55\n days. Capacity revenues are recognized over time, using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations. The Company applies the invoicing practical expedient in recognizing capacity revenue. Under the practical expedient, revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is equal to the value to the customer of NRG’s performance obligation completed to date.\nPerformance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2024, estimated future fixed fee performance obligations are $\n1.6\n billion, $\n1.2\n billion, $\n796\n million, $\n489\n million and $\n219\n million for the fiscal years 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029, respectively. These performance obligations include Vivint Smart Home products and services, as well as cleared auction MWs in the PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO and MISO capacity auctions. The cleared auction MWs are subject to penalties for non-performance. \n105\n                                                     \nDisaggregated Revenues\nThe following tables represent the Company’s

the beginning of each period was $\n606\n million and $\n168\n million, respectively, which increased primarily due to the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home.\nThe Company's capitalized contract costs consist of fulfillment costs, commission payments, broker fees and other costs that represent incremental costs of obtaining the contract with customers for which the Company expects to recover. Capitalized contract costs are amortized to depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit of \nfive years\n.\n108\n                                                     \nWhen the Company receives consideration from the customer that is in excess of the amount due, such consideration is reclassified to deferred revenue, which represents a contract liability. Smart home products and services performance obligations are recognized over the customer's contract term, which is generally \nthree\n to \nfive years\n. Energy contract liabilities are generally recognized to revenue in the next period as the Company satisfies its performance obligations.\nNote 4 —\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\n \nAcquisitions\n2023 Acquisition\nVivint Smart Home Acquisition\nOn March 10, 2023 (the \"Acquisition Closing Date\"), the Company completed the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home, Inc., pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 6, 2022, by and among the Company, Vivint Smart Home, Inc. and Jetson Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”) pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Vivint Smart Home, Inc., with Vivint Smart Home, Inc. surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

NRG's financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded securities, energy derivatives, and trust fund investments.\n•\nLevel 2 — inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. NRG's financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, exchange-based derivatives, and over the counter derivatives such as swaps, options and forward contracts.\n•\nLevel 3 — unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. NRG's financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded, non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds, and are measured using present value pricing models.\nIn accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nDerivative assets and liabilities, debt securities, equity securities and trust fund investments, which were comprised of various U.S. debt and equity securities, are carried at fair market value.\nThe following tables present assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy:\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n \nFair Value\n(In millions)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nInvestments in securities (classified within other current and non-current assets)\n$\n28\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n—\n \nDerivative assets:\n \nInterest rate contracts\n9\n \n—\n \n9\n \n—\n \nForeign exchange contracts\n22\n \n—\n \n22\n \n—\n \nCommodity contracts\n(a)\n3,368\n \n528\n \n2,645\n \n195\n \nEquity securities measured using net asset value practical expedient (classified within other non-current assets)\n6\n \nTotal assets\n$\n3,433\n \n$\n528\n \n$\n2,704\n \n$\n195\n \nDerivative liabilities:\n \nInterest rate contracts\n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \nForeign exchange contracts\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \nCommodity contracts\n(a)\n2,970\n \n432\n \n2,382\n \n156\n \nConsumer Financing Program\n203\n \n—\n \n—\n \n203\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n3,177\n \n$\n432\n \n$\n2,386\n \n$\n359\n \n(a)\nExcludes $\n997\n million of derivative assets and $\n227\n million of derivative liabilities that were elected as NPNS on October 1, 2024 and are no longer valued at fair value on a recurring basis.

Beginning in of the fourth quarter of 2023, the fair value of non-exchange traded contracts were based on consensus pricing provided by independent pricing services. The pricing data was compiled from market makers with longer dated tenors as compared to broker quotes, enhancing reliability and increasing transparency. \nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company valued derivatives based on price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate those transactions. For the majority of markets that NRG participates in, the Company would receive broker quotes from multiple sources and reflected the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices. The terms for which such price information is available vary by commodity, region and product. The Company believes both sources of price quotes are executable.\nThe remainder of the assets and liabilities represents contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available. These contracts are valued based on various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. As of December 31, 2024, contracts valued with prices provided by models and other valuation techniques make up \n6\n% of derivative assets and \n11\n% of derivative liabilities. The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate. In addition, the Company applies a credit reserve to reflect credit risk, which for foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps is calculated utilizing the bilateral method based on published default probabilities. For commodities, to the extent that NRG's net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company uses the counterparty's default swap rate. If the exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability, the Company uses NRG's default swap rate. For foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and commodities, the credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume NRG's liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for NRG's assets. As of December 31, 2024, the credit reserve resulted in a $\n1\n million decrease primarily within cost of operations. As of December 31, 2023, the credit reserve resulted in $\n18\n million decrease primarily within cost of operations.\nThe fair values in each category reflect the level of forward prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2024 and may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates consider various factors including closing exchange, consensus and over-the-counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. It is possible, however, that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities from energy marketing and trading activities and such variations could be material.\n114\n                                                     \nNRG's significant positions classified as Level 3 include physical and financial natural gas, power, capacity contracts and renewable energy certificates executed in illiquid markets as well as financial transmission rights (\"FTRs\"). The significant unobservable inputs used in developing fair value include illiquid natural gas and power location pricing, which is derived as a basis to liquid locations. The basis spread is based on observable market data when available or derived from historic prices and forward market prices from similar observable markets when not available. Forward capacity prices are based on market information, forecasted future electricity demand and supply, past auctions and internally developed pricing models. Renewable energy certificate prices are based on market information and internally developed pricing models. For FTRs, NRG uses the most recent auction prices to derive the fair value. The Consumer Financing Program derivatives are valued using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates.\nThe following tables quantify the significant unobservable inputs used in developing the fair value of the Company's Level 3 positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\nDecember 31, 2024\nFair Value\nInput/Range\n(in millions, except as noted)\nAssets\nLiabilities\nValuation Technique\nSignificant Unobservable Input\nLow\nHigh\nWeighted Average\nNatural Gas Contracts\n$\n56\n \n$\n15\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward Market Price ($ per MMBtu)\n$\n2\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n4\n \nPower Contracts\n57\n \n86\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward Market Price ($ per MWh)\n0\n \n109\n \n39\n \nCapacity Contracts\n34\n \n13\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward Market Price ($ per MW/Day)\n16\n \n510\n \n220\n \nRenewable Energy Certificates\n30\n \n14\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward Market Price ($ per Certificate)\n2\n \n375\n \n15\n \nFTRs\n18\n \n28\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nAuction Prices ($ per MWh)\n(\n50\n)\n16,180\n \n0\n \nConsumer Financing Program\n—\n \n203\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nCollateral Default Rates\n0.52\n \n%\n76.80\n \n%\n11.71\n \n%\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nCollateral Prepayment Rates\n2.00\n \n%\n3.00\n \n%\n2.83\n \n%\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nCredit Loss Rates\n6.00\n \n%\n60.00\n \n%\n14.22\n \n%\n$\n195\n \n$\n359\n \n115\n                                                     \nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value\nInput/Range\n(in millions, except as noted)\nAssets\nLiabilities\nValuation Technique\nSignificant Unobservable Input\nLow\nHigh\nWeighted Average\nNatural Gas Contracts\n$\n39\n \n$\n65\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward Market Price ($ per MMBtu)\n$\n1\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n3\n \nPower Contracts\n197\n \n66\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward Market Price ($ per MWh)\n1\n \n210\n \n47\n \nCapacity Contracts\n21\n \n33\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward Market Price ($ per MW/Day)\n49\n \n658\n \n285\n \nRenewable Energy Certificates\n58\n \n14\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward Market Price ($ per Certificate)\n2\n \n320\n \n15\n \nFTRs\n19\n \n37\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nAuction Prices ($ per MWh)\n(\n58\n)\n252\n \n0\n \nConsumer Financing Program\n—\n \n134\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nCollateral Default Rates\n0.43\n \n%\n93.30\n \n%\n8.12\n \n%\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nCollateral Prepayment Rates\n2.00\n \n%\n3.00\n \n%\n2.95\n \n%\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nCredit Loss Rates\n6.00\n \n%\n60.00\n \n%\n12.57\n \n%\n$\n334\n \n$\n349\n \nThe following table provides sensitivity of fair value measurements to increases/(decreases) in significant unobservable inputs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nSignificant Unobservable Input\nPosition\nChange In Input\nImpact on Fair Value Measurement\nForward Market Price Natural Gas/Power/Capacity/Renewable Energy Certificates\nBuy\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nHigher/(Lower)\nForward Market Price Natural Gas/Power/Capacity/Renewable Energy Certificates\nSell\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nLower/(Higher)\nFTR Prices\nBuy\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nHigher/(Lower)\nFTR Prices\nSell\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nLower/(Higher)\nCollateral Default Rates\nn/a\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nHigher/(Lower)\nCollateral Prepayment Rates\nn/a\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nLower/(Higher)\nCredit Loss Rates\nn/a\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nHigher/(Lower)\nUnder the guidance of ASC 815, entities may choose to offset cash collateral posted or received against the fair value of derivative positions executed with the same counterparties under the same master netting agreements. The Company has chosen not to offset positions as defined in ASC 815. As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $\n309\n million of cash collateral posted and $\n199\n million of cash collateral received on its balance sheet.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nIn addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed in Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, the following item is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Company's financial instruments. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) a daily monitoring of counterparties' credit limits; (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting \n116\n                                                     \nagreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nAs of December 31, 2024, counterparty credit exposure, excluding credit exposure from RTOs, ISOs, and registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was $\n1.7\n billion and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $\n288\n million, resulting in a net exposure of $\n1.5\n billion. NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately \n69\n% of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of 2026. Counterparty credit exposure is valued through observable market quotes and discounted at a risk free interest rate. \nThe following tables highlight net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector and by counterparty credit quality. Net counterparty credit exposure is defined as the aggregate net asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market and NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. The exposure is shown net of collateral held and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.\nCategory\nNet Exposure \n(a) (b)\n(% of Total)\nUtilities, energy merchants, marketers and other\n74\n \n%\nFinancial institutions\n26\n \nTotal\n100\n \n%\nCategory\nNet Exposure\n (a) (b)\n(% of Total)\nInvestment grade\n55\n \n%\nNon-Investment grade/Non-Rated\n45\n \nTotal\n100\n \n%\n(a)\nCounterparty credit exposure excludes coal transportation contracts because of the unavailability of market prices\n(b)\nThe figures in the tables above exclude potential counterparty credit exposure related to RTOs, ISOs, registered commodity exchanges and certain long term contracts\nThe Company had no exposure to wholesale counterparties in excess of \n10\n% of the total net exposure discussed above as of December 31, 2024. Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration. \nRTOs and ISOs\nThe Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, AESO, IESO, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in the majority of these markets is approved by FERC, whereas in the case of ERCOT, it is approved by the PUCT, and whereas in the case of AESO and IESO, both exist provincially with AESO primarily subject to Alberta Utilities Commission and the IESO subject to the Ontario Energy Board. These ISOs may include credit policies that, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. As a result, the counterparty credit risk to these markets is limited to NRG’s share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.\nExchange Traded Transactions \nThe Company enters into commodity transactions on registered exchanges, notably ICE, NYMEX and Nodal. These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.\nLong-Term Contracts\nCounterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term contracts, primarily solar under Renewable PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not always available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Based on these valuation techniques, as of December 31, 2024, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately $\n868\n million for the next \nfive\n years.\n117\n                                                     \nRetail Customer Credit Risk\nThe Company is exposed to retail credit risk through the Company's retail electricity and gas providers, which serve Home and Business customers. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the loss of in-the-money forward value. The Company manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's retail customer credit exposure to Home and Business customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in credit losses. The Company's provision for credit losses was $\n314\n million, $\n251\n million, and $\n11\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for credit losses included the Company's loss mitigation efforts recognized as income of $\n126\n million related to Winter Storm Uri.\nNote 6 — \nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n \nASC 815 requires the Company to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and to measure them at fair value each reporting period unless they qualify for a NPNS exception. The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as cash flow hedges, if certain conditions are met, and defer the change in fair value of the derivatives to accumulated OCI, until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.\nFor derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Certain derivative instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. ASC 815 applies to NRG's energy related commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and Consumer Financing Program.\nAs the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing of its generation assets and retail operations, some of NRG's commercial activities qualify for NPNS accounting. Most of the retail load contracts either qualify for the NPNS exception or fail to meet the criteria for a derivative and the majority of the retail supply and fuels supply contracts are recorded under mark-to-market accounting. All of NRG's hedging and trading activities are subject to limits within the Company's Risk Management Policy.\nOn October 1, 2024, the Company elected NPNS for certain existing derivative contracts. Upon election of NPNS, the Company discontinued derivative accounting treatment and will no longer remeasure the derivative contracts at fair value each reporting period. The fair values of these derivative contracts were frozen as of October 1, 2024 and the Company is derecognizing the fair values to earnings at the same time as the contracts mature. The values of these contracts are included in Derivative instruments captions in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent to the election date, costs associated with these contracts will be recorded when the underlying physical transaction is delivered. These derivative contracts extend through 2036.\nEnergy-Related Commodities\nTo manage the commodity price risk associated with the Company's competitive supply activities and the price risk associated with wholesale power sales from the Company's electric generation facilities and retail power and gas sales from NRG's retail operations, NRG enters into a variety of derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments, utilizing the following:\n•\nForward contracts, which commit NRG to purchase or sell energy commodities or fuels in the future;\n•\nFutures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument;\n•\nSwap agreements, which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual, or notional, quantity;\n•\nOption contracts, which convey to the option holder the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell a commodity; and\n•\nWeather derivative products used to mitigate a portion of lost revenue due to weather.\nThe objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated as hedges include:\n•\nFixing the price of a portion of anticipated power and gas purchases for the Company's retail sales;\n•\nFixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales that provides an acceptable return on the Company's electric generation operations; and\n118\n                                                     \n•\nFixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of the Company's power plants.\nThese contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2024, NRG's derivative assets and liabilities consisted primarily of the following:\n•\nForward and financial contracts for the purchase/sale of electricity and related products economically hedging NRG's generation assets' forecasted output or NRG's retail load obligations through 2034;\n•\nForward and financial contracts for the purchase of fuel commodities relating to the forecasted usage of NRG's generation assets through 2026; \n•\nOther energy derivatives instruments extending through 2029.\nAlso, as of December 31, 2024, NRG had other energy-related contracts that did not meet the definition of a derivative instrument or qualified for the NPNS exception and were therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment as follows:\n•\nLoad-following forward electric sale contracts extending through 2037;\n•\nLoad-following forward natural gas purchase and sale contracts extending through 2032;\n•\nPower tolling contracts through 2036;\n•\nCoal purchase contracts through 2027;\n•\nPower transmission contracts through 2030;\n•\nNatural gas transportation contracts through 2034;\n•\nNatural gas storage agreements through 2030; and\n•\nCoal transportation contracts through 2029.\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nIn order to mitigate foreign exchange risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements through 2028.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nNRG is exposed to changes in interest rate through the Company's issuance of variable rate debt. To manage the Company's interest rate risk, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. The Company had $\n1.0\n billion of interest rate swaps extending through 2027 to hedge the floating rate of the Vivint Term Loans and interest rate swaps with a total nominal value of $\n700\n million extending through 2029 to hedge the floating rate of the Term Loans which were terminated in November 2024. In November 2024, in connection with the amendment of the Term Loans, the Company entered into $\n700\n million of interest rate swaps through 2029 to hedge its floating rate.\nConsumer Financing Program\nUnder the Consumer Financing Program, Vivint Smart Home pays a monthly fee to Financing Providers based on either the average daily outstanding balance of the loans or the number of outstanding loans. For certain loans, Vivint Smart Home incurs fees at the time of the loan origination and receives proceeds that are net of these fees. Vivint Smart Home also shares the liability for credit losses, depending on the credit quality of the customer. Due to the nature of certain provisions under the Consumer Financing Program, the Company records a derivative liability that is not designated as a hedging instrument and is adjusted to fair value, measured using the present value of the estimated future payments. Changes to the fair value are recorded through other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations. The following represent the contractual future payment obligations with the Financing Providers under the Consumer Financing Program that are components of the derivative:\n•    Vivint Smart Home pays either a monthly fee based on the average daily outstanding balance of the loans, or the number of outstanding loans, depending on the Financing Provider;\n•    Vivint Smart Home shares the liability for credit losses depending on the credit quality of the customer; and\n•    Vivint Smart Home pays transactional fees associated with customer payment processing.\nThe derivative is classified as a Level 3 instrument. The derivative positions are valued using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates. In summary, the fair value represents an estimate of the present value of the cash flows Vivint Smart Home will be obligated to pay to the Financing Provider for each component of the derivative.\n119\n                                                     \nVolumetric Underlying Derivative Transactions\nThe following table summarizes the net notional volume buy/(sell) of NRG's open derivative transactions broken out by commodity, excluding those derivatives that qualified for the NPNS exception as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Option contracts are reflected using delta volume. Delta volume equals the notional volume of an option adjusted for the probability that the option will be in-the-money at its expiration date.\n \nTotal Volume (In millions)\nCategory\nUnits\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nEmissions\nShort Ton\n1\n \n—\n \nRenewables Energy Certificates\nCertificates\n13\n \n12\n \nCoal\nShort Ton\n10\n \n9\n \nNatural Gas\nMMBtu\n861\n \n838\n \nPower\nMWh\n91\n \n201\n \nInterest\nDollars\n700\n \n1,000\n \nForeign Exchange\nDollars\n410\n \n548\n \nConsumer Financing Program\nDollars\n1,219\n \n1,116\n \nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nThe following table summarizes the fair value within the derivative instrument valuation on the balance sheet:\n \nFair Value\n \nDerivative Assets\nDerivative Liabilities\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDerivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value Hedges\n:\n \n \n \n \nInterest rate contracts - current\n$\n—\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \nInterest rate contracts - long-term\n9\n \n—\n \n—\n \n8\n \nForeign exchange contracts - current\n15\n \n3\n \n—\n \n4\n \nForeign exchange contracts - long-term\n7\n \n2\n \n1\n \n5\n \nCommodity contracts- current\n2,295\n \n3,847\n \n2,067\n \n3,922\n \nCommodity contracts- long-term\n1,073\n \n2,291\n \n903\n \n1,434\n \nConsumer Financing Program - current\n—\n \n—\n \n137\n \n93\n \nConsumer Financing Program - long-term\n—\n \n—\n \n66\n \n41\n \nDerivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value Hedges\n$\n3,399\n \n$\n6,155\n \n$\n3,177\n \n$\n5,507\n \nDeferred gains/losses on NPNS contracts - current\n376\n \n—\n \n90\n \n—\n \nDeferred gains/losses on NPNS contracts - long-term\n621\n \n—\n \n137\n \n—\n \nDeferred gains/losses on NPNS contracts\n(a)\n$\n997\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n227\n \n$\n—\n \nTotal Derivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value Hedges\n$\n4,396\n \n$\n6,155\n \n$\n3,404\n \n$\n5,507\n \n(a)\nBalances related to certain derivative contracts that were previously accounted for as derivative contracts following the election of the NPNS exemption and the discontinuance of derivative accounting treatment as of the election date\n120\n                                                     \nThe Company has elected to present derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheet on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level.

The collateral potentially required for contracts with adequate assurance clauses that are in net liability positions as of December 31, 2024 was $\n589\n million. The Company is also a party to certain \n122\n                                                     \nmarginable agreements under which it has a net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which was approximately $\n54\n million as of December 31, 2024. In the event of a downgrade in the Company's credit rating and if called for by the counterparty, $\n10\n million of additional collateral would be required for all contracts with credit rating contingent features as of December 31, 2024.\nSee Note 5, \nFair Value of Financial Instruments,\n for discussion regarding concentration of credit risk.\nNote 7 — \nInventory\n \nInventory consisted of:\n \nAs of December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nCoal\n$\n194\n \n$\n178\n \nNatural gas\n126\n \n189\n \nFuel oil\n8\n \n8\n \nFinished goods\n79\n \n164\n \nSpare parts\n71\n \n68\n \nTotal Inventory\n$\n478\n \n$\n607\n \nNote 8 — \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Company's major classes of property, plant, and equipment were as follows:\n \nAs of December 31,\nDepreciable\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nLives\nFacilities and equipment\n$\n1,972\n \n$\n1,918\n \n1\n-\n40\n years\nLand and improvements\n255\n \n256\n \nSoftware\n582\n \n471\n \n5\n years\nHardware and office equipment and furnishings\n278\n \n261\n \n2\n-\n10\n years\nConstruction in progress\n442\n \n152\n \n \nTotal property, plant, and equipment\n3,529\n \n3,058\n \n \nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n1,508\n)\n(\n1,295\n)\n \nNet property, plant, and equipment \n$\n2,021\n \n$\n1,763\n \n \nDepreciation expense of property, plant and equipment recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n271\n million, $\n257\n million and $\n291\n million, respectively.\nNote 9\n \n— \nLeases\nThe Company leases generating facilities, land, office and equipment, railcars, fleet vehicles and storefront space at retail stores. Operating leases with an initial term greater than twelve months are recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company made an accounting policy election, as permitted by ASC 842, for all asset classes not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for its short-term leases, which are leases that have a lease term of twelve months or less. For the initial measurement of lease liabilities, the discount rate that the Company uses is either the rate implicit in the lease, if known, or its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term an amount equal to the payments for the lease. The Company recognizes lease expense for all operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In the future, should another systematic basis become more representative of the pattern in which the lessee expects to consume the remaining economic benefit of the right-of-use asset, the Company will use that basis for lease expense.\nThe Company considers a contract to be or to contain a lease when both of the following conditions apply: 1) an asset is either explicitly or implicitly identified in the contract and 2) the contract conveys to the Company the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time. The Company has the right to control the use of the identified asset when the Company has both the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use.\nLease payments are typically fixed and payable on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. Lease payments under certain agreements may escalate over the lease term either by a fixed percentage or a fixed dollar amount. Certain leases \n123\n                                                     \nmay provide for variable lease payments in the form of payments based on unit availability, usage, a percentage of sales from the location under lease, or index-based (e.g., the U.S. Consumer Price Index) adjustments to lease payments. The Company has no leases which contain residual value guarantees provided by the Company as a lessee.\nLease Cost:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFinance lease cost\n$\n9\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n4\n \n   Amortization of right-of-use assets\n8\n \n7\n \n4\n \n   Interest on lease liabilities\n1\n \n1\n \n—\n \nOperating lease cost\n89\n \n93\n \n85\n \nShort-term lease cost\n32\n \n42\n \n7\n \nVariable lease cost\n91\n \n91\n \n86\n \nSublease income\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nTotal lease cost\n$\n221\n \n$\n232\n \n$\n180\n \nOther information:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\n   Operating cash flows from operating leases\n$\n190\n \n$\n195\n \n$\n183\n \n      Financing cash flows from finance leases\n8\n \n7\n \n5\n \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities\n13\n \n17\n \n3\n \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities\n69\n \n52\n \n28\n \nLease Term and Discount Rate for leases:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nFinance leases:\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years)\n2.7\n2.9\nWeighted average discount rate\n6.26\n \n%\n4.87\n \n%\nOperating leases:\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years)\n5.4\n3.6\nWeighted average discount rate\n6.23\n \n%\n6.00\n \n%\nAs of December 31, 2024, annual payments based on the maturities of the Company's operating leases are expected to be as follows:\nIn millions\n2025\n$\n85\n \n2026\n40\n \n2027\n35\n \n2028\n27\n \n2029\n18\n \nThereafter\n87\n \nTotal undiscounted lease payments\n$\n292\n \nLess: present value adjustment\n(\n109\n)\nTotal discounted lease payments\n$\n183\n \n124\n                                                     \nNote 10 — \nAsset Impairments\n \n2024 Impairment Losses\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company completed its annual budget and analyzed the corresponding impact on estimated cash flows associated with its long-lived assets. The fair value of the assets was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budget for each facility. The income approach utilized estimates of after-tax cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and included key inputs such as forecasted power prices, fuel costs, operating and maintenance costs, plant investment capital expenditures and discount rates.\nAs a result of the evaluation performed, the Company recorded impairment losses of $\n7\n million and $\n14\n million related to its equity method investments in Gladstone and property plant and equipment and leases in the West/Services/Other segment, respectively. For further discussion of the Gladstone investment, see Note 16, \nInvestments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities\n.\nOther Impairments\n — The Company recorded impairment losses related to excess SO\n2 \nallowances of $\n7\n million in the Texas segment and goodwill impairment losses of $\n15\n million in the West/Services/Other segment.\n2023 Impairment Losses\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company completed its annual budget and analyzed the corresponding impact on estimated cash flows associated with its long-lived assets.

The income approach utilized estimates of after-tax cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and included key inputs such as forecasted power prices, fuel costs, operating and maintenance costs, plant investment capital expenditures and discount rates.\nGladstone — \nThe Company recorded impairment losses of $\n102\n million on its equity method investment in Gladstone within the West/Services/Other segment as a result of changes in the long-term outlook of the Gladstone facility, prompted by evolving energy policy conditions in Australia and an assessment of the long-term operational landscape of the facility, which concluded with the annual budget process. For further discussion of the Gladstone investment, see Note 16, \nInvestments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities\n.\nOther Impairments\n — The Company additionally recorded impairment losses related to property plant and equipment and leases of $\n2\n million, $\n4\n million and $\n20\n million in the Texas, East and West/Services/Other segments, respectively.\n2022 Impairment Losses\nAstoria Redevelopment Impairment \n— During the third quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of the land and related assets at the Astoria generating site and the planned withdrawal and cancellation of its proposed Astoria redevelopment project. As a result, the Company impaired $\n43\n million of Astoria project spend in the East segment. For further discussion of the transaction, see Note 4, \nAcquisitions and Dispositions\n.\nPJM Asset Impairments\n — During the second quarter of 2022, the results of the PJM Base Residual Auction for the 2023/2024 delivery year were released leading the Company to revise its long-term view of certain facilities and announce the planned retirement of the Joliet generating facility. The Company considered the near-term retirement date of Joliet and the decline in PJM capacity prices to be a trigger for impairment and performed impairment tests on the PJM generating assets and the goodwill associated with Midwest Generation. The Company measured the impairment losses on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation reporting unit, respectively. Fair values were determined using an income approach in which the Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for the plants and reporting unit. Significant inputs impacting the income approach include the Company's long-term view of capacity and fuel prices, projected generation, the physical and economic characteristics of each plant and the reporting unit as a whole, and the discount rate applied to the after-tax cash flow projections. Impairment losses of $\n20\n million and $\n130\n million were recorded in the East segment on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively.\nOther Impairments\n — The Company additionally recorded impairment losses of $\n13\n million in the East segment.\n125\n                                                     \nNote 11 — \nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\n \nGoodwill\nThe following table presents the changes in goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 based on the Company's reportable segments:\n(in millions)\nTexas\nEast\nWest/Services/Other\nVivint Smart Home\nTotal\nBalance as of January 1, 2023\n$\n710\n \n$\n723\n \n$\n217\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,650\n \nGoodwill resulted from the acquisition of Vivint\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,494\n \n3,494\n \nAsset sales\n(\n67\n)\n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n69\n)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n643\n \n$\n721\n \n$\n221\n \n$\n3,494\n \n$\n5,079\n \nImpairment\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n15\n)\n—\n \n(\n15\n)\nSale of Airtron\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n43\n)\n—\n \n(\n43\n)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n10\n)\n—\n \n(\n10\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n643\n \n$\n721\n \n$\n153\n \n$\n3,494\n \n$\n5,011\n \nIntangible Assets\nThe Company's intangible assets as of December 31, 2024, primarily reflect intangible assets established with the acquisitions of various companies, including Vivint Smart Home, Direct Energy, other retail acquisitions and Texas Genco. Intangible assets are comprised of the following:\n•\nEmission Allowances \n— These intangibles primarily consist of SO\n2\n emission allowances, including those established with the 2006 acquisition of Texas Genco, RGGI emission credits and California carbon allowances. These emission allowances are held-for-use and are amortized to cost of operations based on units of production.\n•\nCustomer and supply contracts \n— These intangibles include the fair value at the acquisition date of in-market and out-of-market customer and supply contracts from the acquisition of Direct Energy and are amortized to revenue and cost of operations, respectively, based upon the fair market value, as of the acquisition date, for each delivery month.\n•\nCustomer relationships\n — These intangibles represent the fair value at the acquisition date of acquired businesses' customer base from the acquisition of Vivint, Direct Energy and other acquisitions. Customer relationships are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense based on the expected discounted future net cash flows by year.\n•\nMarketing partnerships\n — These intangibles represent the fair value at the acquisition date of existing agreements with marketing vendors and loyalty and affinity partners for customer acquisition. Marketing partnerships are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense based on the expected discounted future net cash flows by year.\n•\nTechnology\n — These intangibles represent the fair value at the acquisition date of developed technology for Vivint Smart Home integrated software and products. Technology is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense, ratably based on the expected discounted future net cash flows by year.\n•\nTrade names\n — These intangibles are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis.\n•\nOther\n — These intangibles primarily include renewable energy certificates. RECs are retired, as required, for the applicable compliance period. RECs are expensed to cost of operations based on NRG’s customer usage. Other also included in-market nuclear fuel contracts established from the Texas Genco acquisition in 2006 which were amortized to cost of operations over expected volumes over the life of each contract, costs to extend the operating license for STP Units 1 and 2 and intellectual property related to Goal Zero, which was amortized to depreciation and amortization expense.\n126\n                                                     \nThe following tables summarize the components of NRG's intangible assets:\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nYear Ended December 31,

Notes, 2033 Senior Notes and 2034 Senior Notes \nOn October 30, 2024, the Company issued $\n1.9\n billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, consisting of (i) $\n925\n million aggregate principal amount of \n6.000\n% senior unsecured notes due 2033 (the “2033 Notes”) and (ii) $\n950\n million aggregate principal amount of \n6.250\n% senior unsecured notes due 2034 (the “2034 Notes” and, together with the 2033 Notes, the “Notes”). In addition, on October 30, 2024, the Company issued $\n798\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.750\n% senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the “New NRG \n5.750\n% Senior Notes due 2029”) in connection with the Company’s previously announced offer to exchange. The Notes and the New NRG \n5.750\n% Senior Notes due 2029 are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility. Interest on the New NRG \n5.750\n% Senior Notes due 2029 is paid semi-annually beginning on January 15, 2025 until the maturity date of July 15, 2029. Interest on the 2033 Notes is paid semi-annually beginning on February 1, 2025 until the maturity date of February 1, 2033. Interest on the 2034 Notes is paid semi-annually beginning on May 1, 2025 until the maturity date of November 1, 2034. \nOn October 30, 2024, the Company used the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with the net proceeds of its new incremental term loan B in an aggregate principal amount of $\n450\n million, to pay the cash tender price for any and all of APX Group, Inc.’s \n6.750\n% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 and to repay APX Group, Inc.’s secured term loans in an outstanding aggregate principal amount of approximately $\n1.3\n billion under its senior secured credit agreement. In addition, on October 31, 2024, the Company used the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes and cash on hand to redeem all of its outstanding \n6.625\n% Senior Notes due 2027, of which $\n375\n million aggregate principal amount was outstanding. Any remaining net proceeds from the offering was used to pay the transaction fees, expenses and premiums, to refinance outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes.\nSenior Note Redemptions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company redeemed $\n375\n million in aggregate principal amount of its \n6.625\n% Senior Notes due 2027, at a redemption price equal to \n100.000\n% for $\n382\n million, which included the payment of $\n7\n million of accrued interest, using the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes and cash on hand. In connection with the redemption, the Company wrote-off $\n1\n million of previously deferred financing costs and other fees, which was recorded to loss on debt extinguishment.\n3.750\n% Senior Secured First Lien Note due 2024 Repayment\nOn June 17, 2024, the Company repaid $\n600\n million in aggregate principal amount of its \n3.750\n% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024.\nSenior Credit Facility\nTerm Loan B Incurrence\nOn April 16, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement in order to (i) establish the Existing Term Loan B Facility with borrowings of $\n875\n million in aggregate principal amount and the Existing Term Loans and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Credit Agreement as set forth therein. The proceeds from the Existing Term Loans were used to repay a portion of the Company’s Convertible Senior Notes, all of the Company’s \n3.750\n% senior secured first lien notes due 2024 and for general corporate purposes.\n130\n                                                     \nOn October 30, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Eleventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement in order to include the Incremental Term Loan B Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $\n450\n million and the Incremental Term Loans, which Incremental Term Loan B Facility is fungible for U.S. federal tax purposes with the Existing Term Loan B Facility. The proceeds from the Incremental Term Loans, together with the proceeds of the Notes, were used to repay all loans and other amounts outstanding under APX’s senior secured credit agreement and to pay the cash tender price for any and all of APX Group, Inc.’s \n6.750\n% Senior Secured Notes due 2027. The terms of the Incremental Term Loan B Facility (including pricing) are identical to those applicable to the Existing Term Loan B Facility, and the Incremental Term Loans constitute the same class of term loans as the Company’s Existing Term Loans.\nOn November 26, 2024, the Company, as borrower, entered into the Twelfth Amendment to the Credit Agreement in order to (i) reprice both the Existing Term Loan B Facility and the Incremental Term Loan B Facility and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Credit Agreement as set forth therein.\nFollowing the effectiveness of the Twelfth Amendment, at the Company’s election, the Existing Term Loans and the Incremental Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (1) a fluctuating rate equal to the highest of (A) the rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in effect on such day, plus \n0.50\n%, (B) the rate of interest per annum publicly announced from time to time by The Wall Street Journal as the “Prime Rate” in the United States, and (C) a rate of one-month Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (after giving effect to any floor applicable to Term SOFR) plus \n1.00\n%, in each case, plus a margin of \n0.75\n% or (2) Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (which shall not be less than \n0.00\n%) for a one-, three- or six-month interest period (or such other period as agreed to by the Agent and the lenders, as selected by the Company), plus a margin of \n1.75\n%.\nThe Existing Term Loan B Facility and the Incremental Term Loan B Facility are guaranteed by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and are secured on a first lien basis by substantially all of the Company’s and such subsidiaries’ assets, in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions and limitations set forth in the Credit Agreement.\nThe Existing Term Loans and the Incremental Term Loans have a final maturity date of April 16, 2031 and amortize at a rate of \n1\n% per annum in equal quarterly installments (subject to any adjustments to such amortization payments to ensure that such Incremental Term Loans are fungible for U.S. federal tax purposes with the Existing Term Loans). If an event of default occurs under the Existing Term Loan B Facility or the Incremental Term Loan B Facility, the entire principal amount outstanding thereunder, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable, subject, in certain instances, to the expiration of applicable cure periods. The Existing Term Loan B Facility and the Incremental Term Loan B Facility also provide for customary asset sale mandatory prepayments, reporting covenants and negative covenants governing dividends, investments, indebtedness, and other matters that are customary for similar term loan B facilities.\nOn December 20, 2024, the Company, as borrower, entered into the Thirteenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to (i) add APX Group, Inc. as an additional borrower of the loans under the Credit Agreement on a joint and several basis with the Company and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Credit Agreement as set forth therein.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Ninth Amendment to extend the maturity date of a portion of the revolving commitments thereunder to February 14, 2028.\nOn October 30, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Tenth Amendment to (i) extend the maturity date of its revolving credit facility to October 30, 2029 and (ii) make certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement as set forth therein.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n outstanding borrowings and there were $\n477\n million in letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n2048 Convertible Senior Notes\nAccounting for Convertible Senior Notes —\n Beginning in 2022, the Company no longer records the conversion feature of its convertible senior notes in equity. Instead, the Company combined the previously separated equity component with the liability component, which together is now classified as debt, thereby eliminating the subsequent amortization of the debt discount as interest expense.\nModification to Convertible Senior Notes\n — In 2022, the Company irrevocably elected to eliminate the right to settle conversions only in shares of the Company's common stock, \nsuch that any \nconversion after such date, the Company will pay cash per $1,000 principal amount and will settle in cash or a combination of cash and the Company’s common stock for the remainder, if any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount.\n131\n                                                     \nConvertible Senior Notes Features \n— As of December 31, 2024, the Convertible Senior Notes are convertible, under certain circumstances, into cash or a combination of cash and the Company’s common stock at a price of $\n40.94\n per common share, which is the equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately 24.4241 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2023, the Convertible Senior Notes were convertible at a price of $\n41.83\n per common share, which is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately 23.9079 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes.

The net carrying amounts of the Convertible Senior Notes as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $\n231\n million and $\n572\n million, respectively. The Convertible Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2048, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms.\nThe Convertible Senior Notes are convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, including, among others, during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported sales price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeded \n130\n% of the conversion price for each of at least \n20\n trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the \n30\n consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter (the “Common Stock Sale Price Condition”). As of January 1, 2025, the Company’s Convertible Senior Notes are convertible during the quarterly period ending March 31, 2025 due to the satisfaction of the Common Stock Sale Price Condition. In addition, the Convertible Senior Notes are also convertible during specified periods as follows:\n•\nfrom December 1, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before June 1, 2025; and\n•\nfrom December 1, 2047 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date.\nAll conversions with a conversion date that occurs within the specific periods above will be settled after such period pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes indenture.\nThe following table details the interest expense recorded in connection with the Convertible Senior Notes:\nFor the years ended December 31,\n(In millions, except percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nContractual interest expense\n$\n9\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n16\n \nAmortization of discount and deferred finance costs\n1\n \n2\n \n1\n \nTotal\n$\n10\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n17\n \nEffective Interest Rate\n3.08\n \n%\n3.18\n \n%\n3.01\n \n%\nConvertible Senior Notes Repurchases\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company completed repurchases of a portion of the Convertible Senior Notes using cash on hand and a portion of the proceeds from the Term Loans, as detailed in the table below. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, a $\n260\n million loss on debt extinguishment was recorded in connection with the repurchases below.\n(In millions, except percentages)\nSettlement Period\nPrincipal Repurchased\nCash Paid\n(a)\nAverage Repurchase Percentage\nMarch 2024\n$\n92\n \n$\n151\n \n162.356\n%\nApril 2024\n251\n \n452\n \n179.454\n%\nTotal Repurchases\n$\n343\n \n$\n603\n \n(a)\nIncludes accrued interest of $\n1\n million and $\n2\n million for the March and April repurchases, respectively\n132\n                                                     \nCapped Call Options\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Calls”) to effectively lock in a conversion premium of $\n257\n million on the remaining $\n232\n million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes.

The assets of NRG Receivables are first available to satisfy the claims of the Lenders before making payments on the subordinated note and equity issued by NRG Receivables. The assets of NRG Receivables are not available to the Company and its subsidiaries or creditors unless and until distributed by NRG Receivables. Under the Receivables Facility, certain indirect subsidiaries of the Company sell their accounts receivables to NRG Receivables, subject to certain terms and conditions. In turn, NRG Receivables grants a security interest in the purchased receivables to the Lenders as collateral for cash borrowings and issuances of letters of credit. Pursuant to the Performance Guaranty, the Company has guaranteed, for the benefit of NRG Receivables and the Lenders, the payment and performance by each indirect subsidiary of its respective obligations under the Receivables Facility. The accounts receivables remain on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and any amounts funded by the Lenders to NRG Receivables will be reflected as short-term borrowings. Cash flows from the Receivables Facility are reflected as financing activities in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company continues to service the accounts receivables sold in exchange for a servicing fee.\nIn 2020, the Company entered into the Repurchase Facility related to the Receivables Facility. Under the Repurchase Facility, the Company could borrow up to $\n150\n million, collateralized by a subordinated note issued by NRG Receivables to NRG Retail LLC in favor of the originating entities representing a portion of the balance of receivables sold to NRG Receivables under the Receivables Facility.\nOn June 21, 2024, NRG Receivables LLC (“NRG Receivables”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, amended its existing Receivables Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the scheduled termination date to June 20, 2025, (ii) increase the aggregate commitments from $\n1.4\n billion to $\n2.3\n billion (adjusted seasonally) and (iii) add a new originator. The weighted average interest rate related to usage under the Receivables Facility as of December 31, 2024 was \n0.776\n%. As of December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n outstanding borrowings and there were $\n1.4\n billion in letters of credit issued under the Receivables Facility.\nAlso on June 21, 2024, Direct Energy Services, LLC (in its capacity as additional originator, the “Additional Originator”) entered into a Joinder Agreement (the “Joinder Agreement”) to join as Additional Originator to the Receivables Sale Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2020, among Direct Energy, LP, Direct Energy Business, LLC, Green Mountain Energy Company, NRG Business Marketing, LLC, Reliant Energy Northeast LLC, Reliant Energy Retail Services, LLC, Stream SPE, Ltd., US Retailers LLC and XOOM Energy Texas, LLC, as originators, NRG Retail, as the servicer, and NRG Receivables (the “Receivables Sale Agreement”).

Following any distribution of P-Caps Secured Notes to the holders of the P-Caps, the Company may similarly redeem such P-Caps Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption price described in the P-Caps Indenture, plus accrued but unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Any P-Caps Secured Notes outstanding and held by the Trust as a result of the exercise of the Issuance Right that remain outstanding will also mature on July 31, 2028.\nIn connection with the issuance of the P-Caps, on August 29, 2023, the Company entered into a letter of credit facility agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent and administrative agent, and certain financial institutions for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $\n485\n million.

NRG pension benefits are available to eligible non-union and union employees through various defined benefit pension plans. These benefits are based on pay, service history and age at retirement. Most pension benefits are provided through tax-qualified plans. NRG also provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of employees. Cost sharing provisions vary by the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements.\nNRG maintains \nthree\n separate qualified pension plans, the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees, the NRG Pension Plan and the Pension Plan for Employees of Direct Energy Marketing Limited (“DEML”). Participation in the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees depends upon whether an employee is covered by a bargaining agreement. The NRG Pension Plan was frozen for non-union employees on December 31, 2018. In 2024, the Company commenced the termination process for the defined benefit component of the Pension Plan for Employees of DEML and expects to complete the transaction in 2025.\nNRG expects to

The fair value of the common/collective trust investments is valued at fair value which is equal to the sum of the market value of all of the fund's underlying investments. Certain common/collective trust investments have readily determinable fair value as they publish daily net asset value, or NAV, per share and are categorized as Level 2. Certain other common/collective trust investments and partnerships/joint ventures use NAV per share, or its equivalent, as a practical expedient for valuation, and thus have been removed from the fair value hierarchy table.\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to calculate NRG's benefit obligations:\n \nAs of December 31,\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nWeighted-Average Assumptions\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nDiscount rate\n5.63\n \n%\n4.97\n \n%\n5.55\n \n%\n4.96\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate\n5.38\n \n%\n5.67\n \n%\n4.54\n \n%\n4.66\n \n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.00\n \n%\n3.06\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \nHealth care trend rate\n— \n— \n \n8.3\n% grading to \n4.5\n% in \n2034\n7.7\n% grading to \n4.5\n% in \n2033\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to calculate NRG's benefit expense:\n \nAs of December 31,\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nWeighted-Average Assumptions\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n4.99\n \n%\n5.18\n \n%\n2.89\n%/\n4.71\n%/\n5.41\n%\n4.96\n \n%\n5.19\n \n%\n2.82\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate\n5.67\n \n%\n5.21\n \n%\n3.07\n \n%\n4.66\n \n%\n4.00\n \n%\n1.94\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n6.65\n \n%\n5.55\n \n%\n4.99\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRate of compensation increase\n3.00\n \n%\n3.06\n \n%\n3.06\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nHealth care trend rate\n— \n— \n— \n \n7.4\n% grading to \n4.5\n% in \n2033\n \n7.2\n% grading to \n4.5\n% in \n2028\n6.9\n% grading to \n4.4\n% in \n2028\n141\n                                                     \nNRG uses December 31 of each respective year as the measurement date for the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Company sets the discount rate assumptions on an annual basis for each of NRG's defined benefit retirement plans as of December 31. The discount rate assumptions represent the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at December 31. The Company utilizes the Aon AA Above Median, or AA-AM, yield curve and the AON Canada yield curve to select the appropriate discount rate assumption for its retirement plans. The AA-AM yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from \n6\n months to \n99\n years. Under the AA-AM yield curve, each bond issue used to build this yield curve must be non-callable, and have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's and Fitch ratings. The AON Canada yield curve is based on high quality corporate bonds. Under the AON Canada yield curve, expected plan cash flows were discounted using the yield curve, and then a single rate is determined which produces an equivalent present value.\nNRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. The Investment Committee reviews the asset mix periodically and as the plan assets increase in future years, the Investment Committee may examine other asset classes such as real estate or private equity. NRG employs a building block approach to determining the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification and rebalancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.\nThe target allocations of NRG's pension plan assets were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nU.S. equity\n20\n \n%\nNon-U.S. equity\n13\n \n%\nNon-core assets\n17\n \n%\nFixed income\n50\n \n%\nPlan assets are currently invested in a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S., non-U.S., global, and emerging market equities, as well as among growth, value, small and large capitalization stocks.\nInvestment risk and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly portfolio reviews of each asset fund class to a related performance benchmark, if applicable, and annual pension liability measurements. \nPerformance benchmarks are composed of the following indices:\nAsset Class\nIndex\nU.S. equities\nDow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index\nNon-U.S. equities\nMSCI All Country World Index\nNon-core assets\n(a)\nVarious (per underlying asset class)\nFixed income securities\nBarclays Short, Intermediate and Long Credits/Barclays Strips 20+ Index and FTSE Canada Universe Bond Index\n(a)\nNon-Core Assets are defined as diversifying asset classes approved by the Investment Committee that are intended to enhance returns and/or reduce volatility of the U.S. and non-U.S. equities.

The Capped Calls have a cap price of $\n249.00\n per share, subject to certain adjustments, and effectively lock in a conversion premium of $\n257\n million on the remaining $\n232\n million balance of the Convertible Senior Notes. The options will expire on June 1, 2025 if not exercised. The Capped Calls are separate transactions and not part of the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders' equity. The option price of $\n257\n million incurred in connection with the Capped Calls, of which $\n253\n million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and a $\n4\n million loss was recorded to other income, net to account for the change in the value of the Capped \n145\n                                                     \nCalls during the calculation period which began on May 31, 2024 and concluded on June 28, 2024. The option price will be payable upon the earlier of settlement and expiration of the applicable Capped Calls.\nPreferred Stock\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nOn March 9, 2023 (\"Series A Issuance Date\"), the Company issued \n650,000\n shares of \n10.25\n% Series A Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock. The net proceeds of $\n635\n million, net of issuance costs, were used to partially fund the Vivint Smart Home acquisition.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property and has limited voting rights. The Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, at the option of the Company at any time after March 15, 2028 (\"Series A First Reset Date\") and in certain other circumstances prior to the Series A First Reset Date. The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\n per share, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends. \nSeries A Preferred Stock Dividends\nThe annual dividend rate on each share of Series A Preferred Stock is \n10.25\n% from the Series A Issuance Date to, but excluding the Series A First Reset Date. On and after the Series A First Reset Date, the dividend rate on each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall equal the five-year U.S. Treasury rate as of the most recent reset dividend determination date (subject to a floor of \n1.00\n%), plus a spread of \n5.92\n% per annum. Cumulative cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are payable semiannually, in arrears, on each March 15 and September 15, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. \nIn March and September 2024, the Company declared and paid semi-annual dividends of $\n51.25\n per share on its outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, each totaling $\n33\n million. In September 2023, the Company declared and paid a semi-annual dividend of $\n52.96\n per share, totaling $\n34\n million.\nNote 16 — \nInvestments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities\n \nEntities that are not Consolidated\nNRG accounts for the Company's significant investments using the equity method of accounting. NRG's carrying value of equity investments can be impacted by a number of elements including impairments and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe following table summarizes NRG's equity method investments as of December 31, 2024:\n(In millions, except percentages)\nName:\nEconomic\nInterest\nInvestment Balance\nGladstone\n(a)\n37.5\n \n%\n$\n34\n \nMidway-Sunset Cogeneration Company\n50.0\n \n%\n11\n \nTotal equity investments in affiliates\n$\n45\n \n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of NRG's equity method investment was $\n39\n million lower than the underlying net assets of the investee. The basis difference is being amortized into net income over the remaining estimated useful lives of the underlying net assets. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $\n7\n million of impairment losses on Gladstone. Refer to Note 10, \nAsset Impairments\nThe following table summarizes the undistributed earnings from NRG's equity method investments as of December 31, 2024:\n \nAs of December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nUndistributed earnings\n$\n5\n \n$\n—\n \nOther Equity Investments\nGladstone\n — Through a joint venture, NRG owns a \n37.5\n% interest in Gladstone, a \n1,613\n MW coal-fueled power generation facility in Queensland, Australia. The power generation facility is managed by the joint venture participants and the facility is operated by NRG. Operating expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the facility are funded by each of the participants in proportion to their ownership interests. Coal is sourced from local mines in Queensland. NRG and the joint venture participants receive their respective share of revenues directly from the off takers in proportion to the ownership interests in the joint venture. Power generated by the facility is primarily sold to an adjacent aluminum smelter, with excess power sold to the Queensland Government-owned utility under long-term supply contracts. NRG's investment in Gladstone was $\n34\n million as of December 31, 2024.\n146\n                                                     \nVariable Interest Entities that are Consolidated\nThe Company has a controlling financial interest that has been identified as a VIE under ASC 810 in NRG Receivables LLC, which has entered into financing transactions related to the Receivables Facility as further described in Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases.\nThe summarized financial information for the Company's consolidated VIE consisted of the following:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAccounts receivable and Other current assets\n$\n2,402\n \n$\n1,541\n \nCurrent liabilities\n155\n \n153\n \nNet assets\n$\n2,247\n \n$\n1,388\n \nNote 17 — \nIncome/(Loss) Per Share\n \nBasic income/(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) less cumulative dividends attributable to preferred stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding. Diluted income/(loss) per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic income/(loss) per share, while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period when there is net income. \nDilutive effect for equity compensation and other equity instruments\n — The relative performance stock units and non-vested restricted stock units are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income/(loss) per share. However, these instruments are included in the denominator for purposes of computing diluted income/(loss) per share under the treasury stock method for periods when there is net income. The Convertible Senior Notes are convertible, under certain circumstances, into cash or combination of cash and Company’s common stock. The Company is including the potential share settlements, if any, in the denominator for purposes of computing diluted income/(loss) per share under the if converted method for periods when there is net income. The potential shares settlements are calculated as the excess of the Company's conversion obligation over the aggregate principal amount (which will be settled in cash), divided by the average share price for the period.\nThe reconciliation of NRG's basic and diluted income/(loss) per share is shown in the following table:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n (In millions, except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBasic income/(loss) per share: \n \n \n \nNet income/(loss)\n$\n1,125\n \n$\n(\n202\n)\n$\n1,221\n \nLess: Cumulative dividends attributable to Series A Preferred Stock\n67\n \n54\n \n—\n \nIncome/(Loss) Available to Common Stockholders\n$\n1,058\n \n$\n(\n256\n)\n$\n1,221\n \nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic\n206\n \n228\n \n236\n \nIncome/(Loss) per weighted average common share — basic\n$\n5.14\n \n$\n(\n1.12\n)\n$\n5.17\n \nDiluted income/(loss) per share: \nNet income/(loss)\n$\n1,125\n \n$\n(\n202\n)\n$\n1,221\n \nLess: Cumulative dividends attributable to Series A Preferred Stock\n67\n \n54\n \n—\n \nIncome/(Loss) Available to Common Stockholders\n$\n1,058\n \n$\n(\n256\n)\n$\n1,221\n \nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic\n206\n \n228\n \n236\n \n  Incremental shares attributable to the issuance of equity compensation (treasury stock method)\n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \nIncremental shares attributable to the potential share settlement of Convertible Senior Notes (if converted method)\n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - diluted\n212\n \n228\n \n236\n \nIncome/(Loss) per weighted average common share — diluted\n$\n4.99\n \n$\n(\n1.12\n)\n$\n5.17\n \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2022, the Company had an insignificant number of outstanding equity instruments that were anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of the Company’s diluted income per share. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had \n6\n million of outstanding equity instruments that were anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of the Company’s diluted loss per share.\n147\n                                                     \nNote 18 — \nSegment Reporting\n \nThe Company’s segment structure reflects how management makes financial decisions and allocates resources. The Company manages its operations based on the combined results of the retail, wholesale and generation businesses with a geographical focus except for Vivint Smart Home operations which are reported within the Vivint Smart Home segment. Corporate represents the corporate business activities, and corporate shared services, to support the Company’s operating segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, Corporate now includes interest expense related to its consolidated debt financing activities and income tax expense related to its consolidated U.S. federal, foreign and state income taxes conforming to the way the Company internally manages and monitors the business. Prior periods amounts have been recast for comparative purposes to reflect this change, which had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nNRG's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), its chief executive officer, uses more than one measure to evaluate the performance of its segments and allocate resources, including net income/(loss) and various non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA. Net income/(loss) and Adjusted EBITDA are used to review business performance and allocate resources as it provides a clearer view of segment profitability by focusing on operational performance. Additionally, operating expenses’ impact on each operating segment results are analyzed. On a monthly basis, Adjusted EBITDA is compared against the budget, latest forecast, and prior period. \nThe Company had no customer that comprised more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nIntersegment sales are accounted for at market. \nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2024\n(In

There is no impact on the Company’s provision for income taxes from the CAMT as of December 31, 2024.\n150\n                                                     \nThe following represented the domestic and foreign components of income/(loss) before income taxes:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nU.S. \n$\n1,485\n \n$\n261\n \n$\n1,436\n \nForeign\n(\n37\n)\n(\n474\n)\n227\n \nTotal\n$\n1,448\n \n$\n(\n213\n)\n$\n1,663\n \nReconciliations of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to NRG's effective tax rate were as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions, except effective income tax rate)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome/(Loss) before income taxes\n$\n1,448\n \n$\n(\n213\n)\n$\n1,663\n \nTax at federal statutory tax rate\n304\n \n(\n45\n)\n349\n \nState taxes\n92\n \n(\n22\n)\n69\n \nForeign rate differential \n1\n \n(\n10\n)\n7\n \nChanges in state valuation allowances\n(\n110\n)\n42\n \n(\n3\n)\nNondeductible loss on Convertible Senior Notes repurchases\n56\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPermanent differences\n23\n \n31\n \n17\n \nStock compensation\n(\n19\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nRecognition of uncertain tax benefits\n1\n \n12\n \n8\n \nDeferred impact of state tax rate changes\n(\n24\n)\n3\n \n14\n \nForeign tax refunds\n—\n \n(\n17\n)\n—\n \nReturn to provision adjustments\n(\n1\n)\n(\n5\n)\n—\n \nCarbon capture tax credits\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n19\n)\nIncome tax expense/(benefit)\n$\n323\n \n$\n(\n11\n)\n$\n442\n \nEffective income tax rate\n22.3\n \n%\n5.2\n \n%\n26.6\n \n%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, NRG's effective income tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to permanent differences and state tax expense partially offset by tax benefits from the revaluation of state deferred tax assets, and decrease of certain state valuation allowances.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, NRG's effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to permanent differences and changes in state valuation allowances.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, NRG's effective income tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to state tax expense partially offset by the recognition of carbon capture tax credits.\n151\n                                                     \nThe temporary differences, which gave rise to the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:\n \nAs of December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nDeferred tax assets:\n \n \nU.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards\n$\n1,477\n \n$\n1,762\n \nState net operating loss carryforwards\n341\n \n367\n \nForeign net operating loss carryforwards\n106\n \n110\n \nDeferred revenues\n335\n \n347\n \nDifference between book and tax basis of property\n322\n \n353\n \nFederal and state tax credit carryforwards\n269\n \n317\n \nDeferred compensation, accrued vacation and other reserves\n174\n \n141\n \nInterest disallowance carryforward per §163(j) of the Tax Act\n77\n \n132\n \nPension and other postretirement benefits\n46\n \n48\n \nAllowance for credit losses\n37\n \n35\n \nEquity compensation\n30\n \n24\n \nFederal benefit on state uncertain tax positions\n13\n \n13\n \nInventory obsolescence\n13\n \n11\n \nU.S. capital loss\n1\n \n1\n \nOther\n46\n \n33\n \nTotal deferred tax assets\n3,287\n \n3,694\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nIntangibles amortization (excluding goodwill)\n486\n \n726\n \nDerivatives\n193\n \n156\n \nCapitalized contract costs\n249\n \n131\n \nEquity method investments\n88\n \n93\n \nGoodwill\n56\n \n40\n \nDebt discount amortization\n—\n \n26\n \nEmissions allowances\n16\n \n18\n \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n1,088\n \n1,190\n \nTotal deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities \n2,199\n \n2,504\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n144\n)\n(\n275\n)\nTotal net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n$\n2,055\n \n$\n2,229\n \nThe following table summarizes NRG's net deferred tax position as presented in the consolidated balance sheets:\n \nAs of December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nDeferred tax asset \n$\n2,067\n \n$\n2,251\n \nDeferred tax liability\n(\n12\n)\n(\n22\n)\nNet deferred tax asset\n$\n2,055\n \n$\n2,229\n \nThe primary drivers for the decrease in the net deferred tax asset from $\n2.2\n billion as of December 31, 2023 to $\n2.1\n billion as of December 31, 2024 is due to utilization of net operating losses, partially offset by the decrease of certain state valuation allowances.\nDeferred tax assets and valuation allowance\nNet deferred tax balance\n — As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, NRG recorded a net deferred tax asset, excluding valuation allowance, of $\n2.2\n billion and $\n2.5\n billion, respectively. The Company believes certain state net operating losses may not be realizable under the more-likely-than-not measurement and as such, a valuation allowance was recorded as of December 31, 2024 as discussed below. \n152\n                                                     \nNOL carryforwards\n — As of December 31, 2024, the Company had tax-effected cumulative U.S. NOLs consisting of carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $\n1.5\n billion and $\n341\n million, respectively. In addition, NRG has tax-effected cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $\n106\n million.

There were \n7,188,824\n and \n7,717,139\n shares of common stock remaining available for grants under the NRG LTIP as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The NRG LTIP is subject to adjustments in the event of reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, and a combination of shares, merger or similar change in NRG's structure or outstanding shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2024, the outstanding awards under the NRG LTIP include restricted stock units, deferred stock units and relative performance stock units.\n153\n                                                     \nRestricted Stock Units\nAs of December 31, 2024, RSUs granted under the NRG LTIP typically have \nthree\n-year graded vesting schedules beginning on the grant date. Fair value of the RSUs granted during 2024 and 2023 is derived from the closing price of NRG common stock on the grant date. \nThe following table summarizes the Company's non-vested RSU awards and changes during the year:\nUnits\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Unit\nNon-vested at December 31, 2023\n1,210,840\n \n$\n37.88\n \nGranted\n413,872\n \n51.89\n \nForfeited\n(\n49,082\n)\n39.43\n \nVested\n(\n525,470\n)\n38.38\n \nNon-vested at December 31, 2024\n1,050,160\n \n42.95\n \nThe total fair value of RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n47\n million, $\n20\n million and $\n10\n million, respectively.

DSUs granted under the NRG LTIP are fully vested at the date of issuance. Fair value of the DSUs, which is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant, is recorded as compensation expense in the period of grant.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's outstanding DSU awards and changes during the year:\nUnits\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Unit\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n443,287\n \n$\n29.07\n \nGranted\n46,617\n \n76.31\n \nConverted to Common Stock\n(\n112,784\n)\n30.73\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n377,120\n \n33.91\n \nThe aggregate intrinsic values for DSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $\n34\n million, $\n23\n million and $\n13\n million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values for DSUs converted to common stock for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n10\n million, $\n3\n million and $\n1\n million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of DSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n76.31\n, $\n34.40\n and $\n45.49\n, respectively.\nRelative Performance Stock Units\nRPSUs entitle the recipient to stock upon vesting. The amount of the award is subject to the Company's achievement of certain performance measures over the vesting period. RPSUs are restricted grants where the quantity of shares increases and decreases alongside the Company's Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\"), relative to the TSR of the Company's current proxy peer group and the total returns of select indexes, or Peer Group. The peer group consists of the companies that comprise the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index on the first day of the performance period. Each RPSU represents the potential to receive NRG common stock after the completion of the performance period, typically \nthree\n years of service from the date of grant. The number of shares of NRG common stock to be paid (if any) as of the vesting date for each RPSU will depend on the Company’s percentile rank within the Peer Group. The number of shares of common stock to be paid as of the vesting date for each RPSU is linearly interpolated for TSR performance between the following points: (i) \n0\n% if ranked below the 25th percentile; (ii) \n25\n% if ranked at the 25th percentile; (iii) \n100\n% if ranked at the 55th percentile (or the 65th percentile if the Company's absolute TSR is less than negative \n15\n%); and (iv) \n200\n% if ranked at the 75th percentile or above. \n154\n                                                     \nThe following table summarizes the Company's non-vested RPSU awards and changes during the year:\nUnits\nWeighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value per Unit\nNon-vested at December 31, 2023\n671,889\n \n$\n46.27\n \nGranted\n380,370\n \n62.48\n \nForfeited\n(\n22,623\n)\n52.55\n \nVested\n(\n316,685\n)\n49.50\n \nNon-vested at December 31, 2024\n712,951\n \n53.10\n \nThe weighted average grant date fair value of RPSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $\n62.48\n, $\n39.46\n and $\n57.41\n, respectively. \nThe fair value of RPSUs is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and expensed over the service period, which equals the vesting period. \nSignificant assumptions used in the fair value model with respect to the Company's RPSUs are summarized below:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nExpected volatility\n34.46\n \n%\n41.35\n \n%\n37.54\n \n%\nExpected term (in years)\n3\n3\n3\nRisk free rate\n4.05\n \n%\n4.18\n \n%\n0.97\n \n%\nThe expected volatility is calculated based on NRG's historical stock price volatility data over the period commensurate with the expected term of the RPSU, which equals the vesting period.\nNRG Energy, Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Legacy Vivint)\nEffective March 10, 2023, in connection with the Vivint Smart Home Acquisition, as discussed in Note 4, \nAcquisitions and Dispositions, \nNRG assumed the NRG Energy, Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Legacy Vivint) (formerly known as Vivint Smart Home, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan) or Vivint LTIP. In addition to the rollover awards converted as part of the Acquisition, the Vivint LTIP provides for issuances of time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, \n17,500,000\n shares of NRG common stock were authorized for issuance under the Vivint LTIP. There were \n12,557,143\n and \n12,749,736\n shares of common stock remaining available for grants under the Vivint LTIP as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nRestricted Stock Units\nAs of December 31, 2024, RSUs under the Vivint LTIP include RSUs which were granted prior to the Acquisition and were converted into awards that vest as NRG common stock (\"Rollover RSUs\"). These awards typically had \nfour-year\n graded vesting schedules beginning on the grant date. The fair value of the Rollover RSUs is based on the fair value of NRG common stock on the Acquisition date after applying the conversion ratio as per the Merger Agreement. The RSUs that were granted following the Acquisition date are typically subject to the same terms as the RSUs under the NRG LTIP.\nThe following table summarizes the non-vested RSUs under the Vivint LTIP and changes during the year:\nRollover RSUs\nRSUs granted following the Acquisition\nUnits\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Unit\nUnits\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Unit\nNon-vested at December 31, 2023\n2,984,901\n \n$\n31.63\n \n780,298\n \n$\n35.24\n \nGranted following the Acquisition date\n—\n \n—\n \n800,032\n \n56.02\n \nForfeited\n(\n194,314\n)\n31.63\n \n(\n82,973\n)\n41.38\n \nVested\n(\n1,440,844\n)\n31.63\n \n(\n318,774\n)\n39.52\n \nNon-vested at December 31, 2024\n1,349,743\n \n31.63\n \n1,178,583\n \n47.19\n \nThe total fair value of RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n159\n million and $\n66\n million, respectively.

These contracts are not included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's minimum commitments under such outstanding agreements are estimated as follows:\nPeriod\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n2,414\n \n2026\n2,422\n \n2027\n1,392\n \n2028\n941\n \n2029\n624\n \nThereafter\n1,190\n \nTotal\n(a)\n$\n8,983\n \n(a)\nThe year 2025 does not include an additional $\n1.5\n billion of short-term commitments. Increase from 2023 is primarily due to NPNS election for certain existing derivative contracts. For further discussion, see Note 6, \nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company's actual costs may be significantly higher than these estimated minimum unconditional long-term firm commitments with remaining term in excess of one year. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the costs of fuel and purchased energy were $\n12.2\n billion, $\n13.4\n billion and $\n19.6\n billion, respectively.\nFirst Lien Structure\nNRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of property and assets owned by NRG and the guarantors of its senior debt. NRG uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedges. To the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are out-of-the-money to NRG, the counterparty would have a claim under the first lien program. As of December 31, 2024, all hedges under the first liens were in-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.\nContingencies\nThe Company's material legal proceedings are described below. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to these legal proceedings and intends to defend them vigorously. NRG records accruals for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. As applicable, the Company has established an adequate accrual for the applicable legal matters, including regulatory and environmental matters as further discussed in Note 23, \nRegulatory Matters\n, and Note 24, \nEnvironmental Matters\n. In addition, legal costs are expensed as incurred. Management has assessed each of the following matters based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought, and the probability of success. Unless specified below, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings or reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities. As additional information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment and estimates of such contingencies accordingly. Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Company's liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from its currently recorded accruals and that such difference could be material.\nIn addition to the legal proceedings noted below, NRG and its subsidiaries are party to other litigation or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In management's opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEnvironmental Lawsuits\nSierra club et al. v. Midwest Generation LLC\n — In 2012, several environmental groups filed a complaint against Midwest Generation with the Illinois Pollution Control Board (\"IPCB\") alleging violations of environmental law resulting in groundwater contamination. In June 2019, the IPCB found in an interim order that Midwest Generation violated the law because it had improperly handled coal ash at \nfour\n facilities in Illinois and caused or allowed coal ash constituents to impact groundwater. On September 9, 2019, Midwest Generation filed a Motion to Reconsider numerous issues, which the court \n157\n                                                     \ngranted in part and denied in part on February 6, 2020. In 2023, the IPCB held hearings regarding the appropriate relief. Midwest Generation has been working with the Illinois EPA to address the groundwater issues since 2010.\nConsumer Lawsuits\nSimilar to other energy service companies (\"ESCOs\") operating in the industry, from time-to-time, the Company and/or its subsidiaries may be subject to consumer lawsuits in various jurisdictions where they sell natural gas and electricity.\nVariable Price Case \nMirkin v. XOOM Energy (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 2019)\n — XOOM Energy is a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit pending in New York, alleging that XOOM Energy promised that consumers would pay the same or less than they would have paid if they stayed with their default utility or previous energy supplier. The Court denied XOOM's motion for summary judgment and granted class certification. The Second Circuit denied XOOM's request to appeal the class certification grants. XOOM prevailed in its challenge to Mirkin's expert reports. The Court granted XOOM's motion to exclude both reports on damages. As a result, Mirkin has no method to establish damages for its class. The Court asked for further briefing on whether class certification can stand in light of the recent ruling. This matter was known and accrued for at the time of the XOOM acquisition.\nTelephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\") Cases \n— In the cases set forth below, referred to as the TCPA Cases, such actions involve consumers alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended, by receiving calls, texts or voicemails without consent in violation of the federal Telemarketing Sales Rule, and/or state counterpart legislation. The underlying claims of each case are similar. The Company denies the allegations asserted by plaintiffs and intends to vigorously defend these matters. These matters were known and accrued for at the time of the Direct Energy acquisition.\nThere are \ntwo\n putative class actions pending against Direct Energy: (1) Holly Newman v. Direct Energy, LP (D. Md Sept 2021) - Direct Energy filed its Motion to Dismiss asserting the ruling in the Brittany Burk v. Direct Energy (S.D. Tex. Feb 2019) preempts the Plaintiff's ability to file suit based on the same facts. The Court denied Direct Energy's motion stating the Court does not have the benefit of all of the facts that were in front of the Burk court to issue a similar ruling. On April 12, 2023, the Court granted Direct Energy’s Motion to Transfer Venue, moving to the case to the Southern District of Texas. The parties are proceeding with written discovery; and (2) Matthew Dickson v. Direct Energy (N.D. Ohio Jan. 2018) - The case was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal to the Sixth Circuit based on the unconstitutionality of the TCPA during the period from 2015-2020. The Sixth Circuit found the TCPA was in effect during that period and remanded the case back to the trial court. Direct Energy refiled its motions along with supplements. On March 25, 2022, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Direct Energy and dismissed the case. Dickson appealed. The Sixth Circuit found that Dickson has standing and reversed the trial court's dismissal of the case. The matter is back at the trial court. The parties conducted fact and expert discovery and Direct Energy submitted its motion for summary judgment in August 2024.\nSales Practice Lawsuit\nA Vivint Smart Home competitor has made a claim against Vivint Smart Home alleging, among other things, that Vivint Smart Home's sales representatives used deceptive sales practices. This matter was known and accrued for at the time of the Vivint Smart Home acquisition. CPI Security Systems, Inc. (\"CPI\") v. Vivint Smart Home, Inc. (W.D.N.C. Sept. 2020) was filed in 2020, went to trial, and in February 2023, the jury issued a verdict against Vivint Smart Home, in favor of CPI for $\n50\n million of compensatory damages and an additional $\n140\n million of punitive damages. Vivint Smart Home has fully briefed the appeal and oral argument was conducted on January 28, 2025. While Vivint Smart Home believes the CPI jury verdict is not legally or factually supported and awaits the issuance of the appellate court’s opinion, there can be no assurance that such defense efforts will be successful. This matter was adequately accrued for as of December 31, 2024.\nSB IP Holdings LLC (“Skybell”) v. Vivint Smart Home, Inc. \n— O\nn October 23, 2023, a jury in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division, issued a verdict against the Company in favor of Skybell for $\n45\n million in damages for patent infringement. The patents that were the basis for the claims made by Skybell were ruled invalid by the U.S. International Trade Commission in November 2021. The Company does not believe the verdict is legally supported and is pursuing appellate remedies along with any other legal options available. At the time of the Vivint Smart Home acquisition, this matter was known and accrued for at the amount that was determined to be probable and reasonably estimable.\nContract Dispute\nSTP — \nIn July 2023, the partners in STP, CPS and Austin Energy, initiated a lawsuit and filed to intervene in the license transfer application with the NRC, claiming a right of first refusal exists in relation to the proposed sale of NRG South Texas' 44% interest in STP to Constellation. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in May 2024, and the litigation was dismissed. There was no incremental impact to NRG as a result of the settlement.\n158\n                                                     \nWinter Storm Uri Lawsuits\nThe Company has been named in certain property damage and wrongful death claims that have been filed in connection with Winter Storm Uri in its capacity as a generator and a REP. Most of the lawsuits related to Winter Storm Uri are consolidated into a single multi-district litigation matter in Harris County District Court. NRG's REPs have since been dismissed from the multi-district litigation. As a power generator, the Company is named in various cases with claims ranging from: wrongful death; personal injury only; property damage and personal injury; property damage only; and subrogation. The First Court of Appeals conditionally granted the generators' mandamus relief, ordering the trial court to grant the generator defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The plaintiffs challenged the ruling and the matters are stayed pending appeals by the various parties. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters.\nNote 23 — \nRegulatory Matters\n \nEnvironmental regulatory matters are discussed within Note 24, \nEnvironmental Matters\n.\nNRG operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to regulation by various federal, state and provincial agencies. As such, NRG is affected by regulatory developments at the federal, state and provincial levels and in the regions in which NRG operates. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures, and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which NRG participates. These power markets are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes that may impact NRG's wholesale and retail operations.\nIn addition to the regulatory proceedings noted below, NRG and its subsidiaries are parties to other regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or have other regulatory exposure. In management's opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCalifornia Station Power \n—\n \nAs the result of unfavorable final and non-appealable litigation, the Company accrued a liability associated with consumption of station power at the Company's Encina power plant facility in California after August 30, 2010. The Company has established an appropriate accrual pending potential regulatory action by San Diego Gas & Electric regarding the Company's Encina facility.\nFederal Trade Commission Investigation\n — In 2019, Vivint Smart Home received a civil investigative demand from the staff of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) concerning potential violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the “Red Flags Rule” thereunder, and the FTC Act. In April 2021, Vivint Smart Home entered into a settlement with the FTC that resolved this investigation. As part of this settlement, Vivint Smart Home paid $\n20\n million and agreed to implement various additional compliance related measures (\"Stipulated Order\"). The Company is engaged in ongoing discussions with the staff of the FTC regarding the Company’s compliance with the terms of the Stipulated Order. Under the terms of the Stipulated Order, Vivint Smart Home is required to undertake biennial assessments by an independent third-party assessor (the \"Assessor\"), which reviews Vivint Smart Home’s compliance program and provides a report on Vivint Smart Home’s ongoing compliance with the Stipulated Order. Since its inception until December 31, 2023, Vivint Smart Home has completed its initial assessment and its first biennial assessment as required by the Stipulated Order. In addition, Vivint Smart Home has voluntarily undertaken nine quarterly audits by the appointed Assessor. In all the assessments, Vivint Smart Home received a report from the Assessor with no findings of non-compliance of any kind.\nNew York State Public Service Commission (\"NYSPSC\") - Notice of Apparent Violation \n— The NYSPSC issued an order referred to as the Retail Reset Order in December 2019 that limited ESCO's offers for electric and natural gas to three compliant products: guaranteed savings from the utility default rate, a fixed rate commodity product that is priced at no more than 5% greater than the trailing 12-month average utility supply rate or New York-sourced renewable energy that is at least 50% greater than the prevailing New York Renewable Energy Standard for load serving entities. The order effectively limited ESCO offers to natural gas customers to only the guaranteed savings and capped fixed term compliant products because no equivalent renewable energy product exists for natural gas. NRG took action to comply with the order when it became effective April 16, 2021. On January 8, 2024, the NYSPSC notified \neight\n of NRG's retail energy suppliers (serving both electricity and natural gas) of alleged non-compliance with New York regulatory requirements. Among other items, the notices allege that the NRG suppliers did not transition existing residential customers to \none\n of the \nthree\n compliant products authorized by the NYSPSC following the effective date of the order. NRG responded to the notices in February 2024. The Company believes it has complied with the Retail Reset Order and does not agree with the NYSPSC's assertions made in the notice. The outcome of this process has the potential to negatively impact the retail business in New York.\nNote 24 — \nEnvironmental Matters\nNRG is subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of power plants. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and maintained during operation of power plants. The electric generation industry has been facing increasingly stringent \n159\n                                                     \nrequirements regarding air quality, GHG emissions, combustion byproducts, water use and discharge, and threatened and endangered species including \nfour\n rules promulgated during the second quarter of 2024. In general, future laws are expected to require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or to impose additional restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company has elected to use a $\n1\n million disclosure threshold, as permitted, for environmental proceedings to which the government is a party.\nAir\nCPP/ACE Rules\n — The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal and state regulations. In 2019, the EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO\n2\n emissions from the power sector. The ACE rule required states that have coal-fired EGUs to develop plans to seek heat rate improvements from coal-fired EGUs. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the \"generation shifting\" approach in the CPP exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress. The Court did not address the related issues of whether the EPA may adopt only measures applied at each source. On May 9, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that repealed the ACE rule and significantly revised the manner in which new combustion-turbine and existing steam EGU's GHG emissions will be regulated including capturing and storing/sequestering CO\n2\n in some instances. This rule has been challenged by numerous parties in the D.C. Circuit including 27 states with 22 states intervening in support of the rule. The DC Circuit held oral arguments related to this rule in December 2024. On February 5, 2025, the DOJ filed a motion asking the court to hold proceedings in abeyance while the new administration evaluates the rule. The court granted the motion on February 19, 2025.\nCSAPR\n — On March 15, 2023, the EPA signed and released a prepublication version of a final rule that sought to significantly revise the CSAPR to address the good-neighbor obligations of the 2015 ozone NAAQS for 23 states after earlier having disapproved numerous state plans to address the issue. Several states, including Texas, challenged the EPA's disapproval of their state plans. On May 1, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the EPA's disapproval of Texas' and Louisiana's state plans, which disapprovals are a condition precedent to the EPA imposing its plan on Texas and Louisiana. Several other states are also similarly situated because of similar stays. Nonetheless, on June 5, 2023, the EPA promulgated this rule. On July 31, 2023, the EPA promulgated an interim final rule that addresses the various judicial orders that have stayed several State-Implementation-Plan disapprovals by limiting the effectiveness of certain requirements of the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023 in Texas and several other states. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the final rule in the 11 states where the rule had not already been stayed. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the legal challenges to the: (i) various state disapprovals; (ii) the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023; and (iii) the interim final rule promulgated on July 31, 2023 that seeks to address the judicial orders. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule.\nRegional Haze Proposal\n — In May 2023, the EPA proposed to withdraw the existing Texas Sulfur Dioxide Trading Program and replace it with unit-specific SO\n2 \nlimits for 12 units in Texas to address requirements to improve visibility at National Parks and Wilderness areas. If finalized as proposed, it would result in more stringent SO\n2\n limits for \ntwo\n of the Company's coal-fired units in Texas. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this proposal.\nMercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”) — \nOn May 7, 2024, the EPA promulgated a final rule that amends the MATS rule by, among other things, increasing the stringency of the filterable particulate matter standard at coal-burning units. The deadline for complying with this more stringent standard is 2027. \nTwenty-three\n states have challenged this rule in the D.C. Circuit. Accordingly, the outcome of this rulemaking is uncertain. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule.\nWater\nELG \n— In 2015, the EPA revised the ELG for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas mercury control. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that, among other things, postponed the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for bottom ash transport water; and (iii) changing several deadlines. In 2021, NRG informed its regulators that the Company intends to comply with the ELG by ceasing combustion of coal by the end of 2028 at its domestic coal units outside of Texas, and installing appropriate controls by the end of 2025 at its \ntwo\n plants that have coal-fired units in Texas. On May 9, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that revises the ELG by, among other things, further restricting the discharge of (i) FGD wastewater, (ii) bottom ash transport water, and (iii) combustion residual leachate. The rule was challenged in numerous courts, but the cases have been consolidated in the Eighth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. The outcome of the legal challenges is uncertain. On February 19, 2025, the DOJ filed a motion asking \n160\n                                                     \nthe court to hold proceedings in abeyance while the new administration evaluates the rule. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule. \nByproducts\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had not adequately regulated unlined ponds and legacy surface impoundments. On August 28, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Close Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure,\" which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some of the deadlines. On November 12, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part B: Alternative Demonstration for Unlined Surface Impoundments,\" which further amended the April 2015 Rule to, among other things, provide procedures for requesting approval to operate existing ash impoundments with an alternate liner. On May 8, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that establishes requirements for: (i) inactive (or legacy) surface impoundments at inactive facilities and (ii) CCR management units (regardless of how or when the CCR was placed) at regulated facilities. The rule also creates an obligation to conduct site assessments (at all active and certain inactive facilities) to determine whether CCR management units are present. The rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit and the outcome of the legal challenges is uncertain. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule.\nNote 25 — \nCash Flow Information\n \nDetail of supplemental disclosures of cash flow and non-cash investing and financing information was:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n (In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest paid, net of amount capitalized\n$\n626\n \n$\n548\n \n$\n383\n \nIncome taxes paid, net of refunds\n182\n \n48\n \n66\n \nNon-cash investing and financing activities:\nDecreases to fixed assets for accrued capital expenditures\n(\n76\n)\n—\n \n(\n68\n)\nExcise tax accrued on share repurchases\n9\n \n10\n \n—\n \nNote 26 — \nGuarantees\n \nNRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company's business activities. Examples of these contracts include asset purchases and sale agreements, commodity sale and purchase agreements, retail contracts, joint venture agreements, EPC agreements, operation and maintenance agreements, service agreements, settlement agreements, and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties, as well as affiliates. These contracts generally indemnify the counterparty for tax, environmental liability, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these agreements. The Company is obligated with respect to customer deposits associated with the Company's retail operations. In some cases, NRG's maximum potential liability cannot be estimated, since the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential liability. \nThe following table summarizes the maximum potential exposures that can be estimated for NRG's guarantees, indemnities, and other contingent liabilities by maturity:\n \nBy Remaining Maturity at December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n \nGuarantees\nUnder\n1 Year\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\nOver\n5 Years\nTotal\n2023 Total\nLetters of credit and surety bonds\n$\n3,996\n \n$\n181\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4,188\n \n$\n4,592\n \nAsset sales guarantee obligations\n11\n \n20\n \n18\n \n53\n \n102\n \n126\n \nOther guarantees\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n27\n \n27\n \n27\n \nTotal guarantees\n$\n4,007\n \n$\n201\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n80\n \n$\n4,317\n \n$\n4,745\n \nLetters of credit and surety bonds\n — As of December 31, 2024, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently obligated for a total of $\n4.2\n billion under letters of credit and surety bonds. Most of these letters of credit and surety bonds are issued in support of the Company's obligations to perform under commodity agreements and obligations associated with future closure and maintenance of ash sites, as well as for financing or other arrangements. A majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds expire within \none\n year of issuance, and it is typical for the Company to renew them on similar terms.\n161\n                                                     \nThe material indemnities, within the scope of ASC 460, are as follows:\nAsset sales\n — The purchase and sale agreements which govern NRG's asset or share investments and divestitures customarily contain guarantees and indemnifications of the transaction to third parties. The contracts indemnify the parties for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the indemnifying party, changes in tax laws or for pre-existing environmental matters. These obligations generally have a discrete term and are intended to protect the parties against risks that are difficult to predict or estimate at the time of the transaction. In several cases, the contract limits the liability of the indemnifier. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company currently has any material liability relating to such routine indemnification obligations included in the table above, except for the California property tax indemnity for estimated increases in California property taxes of certain solar properties that the Company agreed to indemnify, as part of the agreement to sell NRG Yield and the Renewables Platform. The California property tax indemnity is estimated to be $\n102\n million as of December 31, 2024 and is included in the above table under asset sales guarantee obligations.\nOther guarantees\n — NRG has issued other guarantees of obligations including payments under certain agreements with respect to certain of its unconsolidated subsidiaries, payment or performance by fuel providers and payment or reimbursement of credit support and deposits. The Company does not believe that it will be required to perform under these guarantees.\nOther indemnities\n — Other indemnifications NRG has provided cover operational, tax, litigation and breaches of representations, warranties and covenants. NRG has also indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of business, consultants or other vendors who have provided services to the Company. NRG's maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an indeterminate amount, depending on the nature of the transaction. Total maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved. NRG does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.\nBecause many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to third parties and affiliates do not limit the amount or duration of its obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk that the Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts described above. For those guarantees and indemnities that do not limit the Company's liability exposure, it may not be able to estimate what the Company's liability would be, until a claim is made for payment or performance, due to the contingent nature of these contracts.\nNote 27 — \nJointly Owned Plant\n \n    \nNRG owns an undivided interest in Cedar Bayou. Cedar Bayou is maintained and operated pursuant to its joint ownership participation and operating agreement. NRG is responsible for its subsidiary’s share of operating costs and direct expenses and includes its proportionate share of the facility and related revenues and direct expenses in the jointly-owned
