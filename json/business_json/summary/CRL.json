We believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results . The scope of studies or projects may change, which may either increase or decrease their value .\n Delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue, modify or cancel the study has been made . We may not be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year . Delays include failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements, or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary ."
