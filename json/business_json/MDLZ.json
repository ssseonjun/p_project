Our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on four strategic priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence, creating a winning growth culture and scaling sustainable snacking. We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our attractive global footprint, strong core of iconic global and local brands, marketing, sales, distribution and cost excellence capabilities, and top talent with a growth mindset, will drive consistent top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. \nFor more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to Item 1, \nBusiness.\nRecent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability\nMacroeconomic environment\nWe continue to observe significant market and geopolitical uncertainty, fluctuating consumer demand, inflationary pressures, supply constraints, trade and regulatory uncertainty and exchange rate volatility. As a result, we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, labor and energy costs that have continued to rise. In particular, we expect to continue to face higher cocoa costs, as the market price for cocoa beans has increased significantly year-over-year and it is likely that prices will remain elevated for some time. Refer to \nCommodity Trends\n for additional information.\nOur overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong; however, we anticipate ongoing volatility. We will continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving global economic environment, related uncertainty and business risks while also prioritizing and supporting our employees and customers. We continue to take steps to mitigate impacts to our supply chain, operations, technology and assets.\nAdditionally, we provide more information on risks related to trade and regulatory uncertainty in our \nFinancial Outlook\n section and under",

In 2024, Organic Net Revenue increased due to higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. In 2023, Organic Net Revenue grew due to higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. Refer to \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n for the definition of Organic Net Revenue and \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n for our reconciliation with net revenues.\n•\nDiluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International decreased 5.5% to $3.42 in 2024 and increased 84.7% to $3.62 in 2023. \n–\nDiluted EPS decreased in 2024 driven by lapping prior-year gain on marketable securities, lapping prior-year gain on equity method investment transactions, 2024 net loss on equity method transactions including an impairment, lapping prior-year gain and operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, higher intangible asset impairment charges and costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program. These unfavorable items were partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EPS, favorable year-over-year change in acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from commodity and currency derivatives, lower divestiture-related costs, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, favorable year-over-year change in initial impacts from enacted tax law changes and lapping prior-year impact from the European Commission legal matter. \n–\nDiluted EPS increased in 2023 driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, a gain on marketable securities, favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, higher net gain on equity method investment transactions, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, lapping prior year incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine, a gain on divestiture, lapping prior year loss on debt extinguishment, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges. These favorable items were partially offset by lower operating results from divestitures, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher negative initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position, higher divestiture-related costs, lapping prior year 2017 malware incident net recoveries and higher Simplify to Grow program costs. \n•\nAdjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 9.1% to $3.36 in 2024 and increased 15.4% to $3.08 in 2023. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 13.0% to $3.48 in 2024 and increased 20.2% to $3.21 in 2023. Refer to \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n for the definition of Adjusted EPS and \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n for our reconciliation with diluted EPS. \n–\nAdjusted EPS increased in 2024, driven by operating gains, fewer shares outstanding, lower taxes, lower interest expense, impact from an acquisition and higher benefit plan non-service income, partially offset by unfavorable currency-related items and lapping prior year dividend income related to our former KDP investment. \n–\nAdjusted EPS increased in 2023, driven by operating gains, impact from acquisitions, lower interest expense, fewer shares outstanding, dividend income from marketable securities and higher equity method investment earnings, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, higher taxes and lower benefit plan non-service income.\n36\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion and Analysis of Historical Results\nItems Affecting Comparability of Financial Results\nThe following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our results of operations and our effective tax rates.

Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2024. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was driven by volume declines, reflecting the impacts of expected customer price negotiation disruptions in Europe primarily in the second quarter, consumer demand softness in the U.S. and Mexico in the first half of the year and geopolitical impacts in parts of AMEA, which were partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected in Europe and Latin America, partially offset by a gain in AMEA, while North America was essentially flat. The November 1, 2024 acquisition of Evirth added incremental net revenues of $72 million (constant currency basis) in 2024. Currency-related items decreased net revenues by $710 million, driven by unfavorable currency \n38\nTable of Contents\ntranslation rate changes, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina. Refer to \nRecent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability \nfor additional information. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, primarily the Argentinean peso, as well as the Brazilian real, Nigerian naira, Turkish Lira, Russian ruble, Egyptian pound, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Polish zloty, euro and Colombian peso. The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $484 million in 2024.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2024, was reflected across all regions. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs, as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, grains, dairy and packaging costs. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was due to volume declines partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was experienced in all regions.\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $563 million from 2023, which was net of benefits from a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, favorable contingent consideration adjustments related to the Clif Bar acquisition and lower acquisition integration costs, lapping prior-year divestiture-related costs, the elimination of costs from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, a favorable currency translation impact related to expenses and lapping prior-year impact from the European Commission legal matter, marginally offset by costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program and higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $215 million from 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher overhead costs in part due to increased investments in route to market capabilities.\nUnfavorable currency-related items, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, decreased\n \noperating income by $191 million primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Brazilian real, Egyptian pound, Turkish lira, Chinese yuan and Nigerian naira, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling and Polish zloty.\nOperating income margin increased from 15.3% in 2023 to 17.4% in 2024. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by favorable year-over-year change in acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from commodity and currency hedging activities, higher Adjusted Operating Income margin, lower divestiture-related costs, lapping prior-year impact from the European Commission legal matter and lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, partially offset by higher intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prior-year gain and the impact from the developed market gum business divested in 2023 and costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.9% in 2023 to 16.2% in 2024. The increase was driven primarily by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and overhead cost leverage, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.\n40\nTable of Contents\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International\nNet earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $4,611 million decreased by $(348) million (7.0%) in 2024.

Overall, we continued to see strong demand for our snack category products across most regions. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2022 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2023. Favorable volume/mix was driven by AMEA, Latin America and Europe reflecting both improved product mix and volume gains, while volume/mix was essentially flat in North America. The November 1, 2022 acquisition of Ricolino added incremental net revenues of $507 million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. The August 1, 2022 acquisition of Clif Bar added incremental net revenues of $529 million through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of $22 million. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,096 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, primarily due to the Argentinean peso and Russian ruble as well as the Turkish lira, Egyptian pound, Indian rupee, Chinese yuan, Nigerian naira, Australian dollar, \n43\nTable of Contents\nSouth African rand, Pakistan rupee and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Mexican peso, euro, Brazilian real, Polish zloty and British pound sterling.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2022 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2023, was reflected across all regions. Overall, volume/mix benefited from improved product mix and continued strong demand for our snack category products across most regions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by AMEA, Latin America and Europe, which was marginally offset by slightly unfavorable volume/mix in North America. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, slightly offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher energy, sugar, grains, dairy, cocoa, packaging, edible oils and other ingredients costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials. \nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses increased $618 million from 2022, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the impact of acquisitions, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher divestiture-related costs, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position and lapping prior-year 2017 malware incident net recoveries, which were offset by a lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, a favorable currency impact related to expenses, lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program, the impact from divestitures and lower incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $947 million from 2022. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher overhead costs in part due to increased investments in route to market capabilities.\nUnfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $190 million, primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Russian ruble, Argentinean peso, Egyptian pound, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Turkish lira, Australian dollar and South African rand, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Polish zloty.\nOperating income margin decreased from 11.2% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lower incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine, gain on the sale of our developed market gum business, lower intangible asset impairment charges, higher Adjusted Operating Income margin and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges, partially offset by higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher divestiture-related costs, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position and lapping prior year 2017 malware incident net recoveries. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.8% in 2022 to 15.9% in 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher net pricing, overhead cost leverage, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and favorable product mix, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.\n45\nTable of Contents\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International\nNet earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $4,959 million increased by $2,242 million (82.5%) in 2023.

Currency-related items were unfavorable, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, due to currency translation rate changes. Unfavorable currency translation impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Chilean peso, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Colombian peso. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix reflected volume declines due to consumer softness, primarily in Mexico and Argentina, partially offset by favorable product mix. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in chocolate, candy, cheese & grocery and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits & baked snacks and gum. Higher net pricing, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, was driven by input cost-driven pricing actions and reflected across all categories, primarily in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. \nSegment operating income increased $3 million (0.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower remeasurement loss on net monetary position, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity, lower acquisition integration costs and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses. These favorable items were mostly offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency-related items, unfavorable volume/mix, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and intangible asset impairment charges incurred in 2024. \n2023 compared with 2022\nNet revenues increased $1,377 million (37.9%), due to higher net pricing (31.0 pp), the impact of acquisitions (14.0 pp) and favorable volume/mix (3.8 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (10.0 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.9 pp). Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina as well as Brazil and Mexico. The November 1, 2022 acquisition of Ricolino added incremental net revenues of $507 million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2023. Favorable volume/mix reflected strong volume growth as the region continued to see increased demand for most of our snack category products. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in gum, biscuits & baked snacks, candy and cheese & grocery, partially offset by declines in refreshment beverages and chocolate. Unfavorable currency impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Mexican peso and Brazilian real. The impact of our 2022 divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $22 million.\nSegment operating income increased $141 million (36.3%), primarily due to higher net pricing, the impact of our Ricolino acquisition, favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher remeasurement loss on net monetary position and higher acquisition integration costs.\n49\nTable of Contents\nAMEA\n \n \nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\n \n(in millions)\n \nNet revenues\n$\n7,296 \n$\n7,075 \n$\n221 \n3.1 \n%\nSegment operating income\n1,192 \n1,113 \n79 \n7.1 \n%\n \nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n2023\n2022\n$ Change\n% Change\n \n(in millions)\n \nNet revenues\n$\n7,075 \n$\n6,767 \n$\n308 \n4.6 \n%\nSegment operating income\n1,113 \n929 \n184 \n19.8 \n%\n2024 compared with 2023\nNet revenues increased $221 million (3.1%), due to higher net pricing (5.5 pp) the impact of an acquisition (1.0 pp), and favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp), partly offset by unfavorable currency translation rate changes (4.1 pp).

The November 1, 2024 acquisition of Evirth added incremental net revenues of $72 million (constant currency basis) in 2024. Overall, favorable volume/mix reflected favorable product mix, partially offset by volume declines reflecting the impact of geopolitical events in the region. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in gum, biscuits & baked snacks, chocolate and cheese & grocery, partially offset by declines in refreshment beverages and candy. Unfavorable currency translation impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Nigerian naira, Egyptian pound, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Vietnam dong, Philippine peso and Japanese yen.\nSegment operating income increased $79 million (7.1%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and the impact from our Evirth acquisition.

Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories except cheese & grocery. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix reflected volume declines due to the impact from customer price negotiation disruptions primarily in the second quarter, partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in chocolate, biscuits & baked snacks, refreshment beverages, candy and gum, partially offset by a gain in cheese & grocery. The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $174 million. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies across the region, including the Turkish lira, Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnya, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Polish zloty and euro.\nSegment operating income increased $90 million (4.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower divestiture-related costs, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower remeasurement loss on net monetary position. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, lapping prior-year operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency translation rate changes, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and higher fixed asset impairment costs. \n2023 compared with 2022\nNet revenues increased $1,437 million (12.6%), due to higher net pricing (13.8 pp), favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp) and the impact from short-term distributor agreements (0.2 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (1.9 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.2 pp). Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. Overall, volume/mix was favorable driven by improved product mix. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in biscuits & baked snacks, chocolate, gum and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in cheese & grocery and candy. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of $22 million. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies across the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone, Ukrainian hryvnya and Swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Polish zloty, British pound sterling and Swiss franc. The impact of divestitures reflected a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $4 million from our 2023 divested developed market gum business.\nSegment operating income increased $497 million (33.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lapping the prior year incremental costs incurred due to the war in Ukraine, lower acquisition integration costs and favorable volume/mix.

The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $310 million. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Volume/mix was flat for the year as volume trends improved in the second half of 2024 offsetting consumer softness experienced in the U.S. in the first half of 2024. Overall, a volume/mix gain in chocolate was offset by declines in biscuits & baked snacks and candy. Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. \nSegment operating income increased $400 million (19.1%), primarily due to a favorable contingent consideration adjustment related to Clif Bar as well as lower acquisition integration costs, higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower divestiture-related costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and lower fixed asset impairment charges. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lapping prior-year operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, unfavorable volume/mix, higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program. \n2023 compared with 2022\nNet revenues increased $1,398 million (14.4%), due to higher net pricing (9.5 pp), the impact of acquisitions (5.6 pp) and flat volume/mix (- pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (0.4 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.3 pp). Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. The August 1, 2022 acquisition of Clif Bar added incremental net revenues of $529 million through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2023. Overall, volume/mix was flat as slight volume gains were offset by unfavorable mix. Flat volume/mix was driven by gains in candy and chocolate offset by a decline in biscuits & baked snacks. While the impact of divestitures reflected a year-over-year increase in net revenues of $12 million (net of the loss of revenue for the fourth quarter) from our 2023 divested developed market gum business, it had a negative impact on the net revenue growth rate as the divested business did not grow as fast as the remaining segment. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. \nSegment operating income increased $323 million (18.3%), primarily due to higher net pricing, the impact of our Clif Bar acquisition, higher operating results from the divested developed market gum business, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, an intangible asset impairment charge incurred in 2023, divestiture-related costs incurred in 2023, unfavorable volume/mix and unfavorable currency.\n53\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nWe believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. We expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed. We continually evaluate long-term debt issuances to meet our short- and longer-term funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, and we continue to monitor our global operations including the impact of ongoing or new conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. To date, we have been successful in generating cash and raising financing as needed. However, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues or other adverse developments arise, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, tax liabilities, benefit plan obligations and lease expenses) as well as periodic expenditures for acquisitions, shareholder returns (such as dividend payments and share repurchases), property, plant and equipment and any significant one-time non-operating items. \nLong-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (refer to Note 9, \nDebt and Borrowing Arrangements\n), our U.S. tax reform transition tax liability and deferred taxes (refer to Note 16, \nIncome Taxes\n), our long-term benefit plan obligations (refer to Note 11, \nBenefit Plans\n)\n \nand commodity-related purchase commitments and derivative contracts (refer to Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments\n). \nWe generally fund short- and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities as well as cash proceeds from short- and long-term debt financing (refer to \nDebt\n below). We generally do not use equity to fund our ongoing obligations.\nFor a full discussion related to the financial condition for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, including a year-to-year comparison between 2023 and 2022, see Part II, Item 7 - \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\n and \nResults of Operations\n in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nCash Flow\nWe believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily access capital markets and secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths and give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments. Our cash flow activity over the last three years is noted below:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by/(used in):\n Operating activities\n$\n4,910 \n$\n4,714 \n$\n3,908 \n Investing activities\n526 \n2,812 \n(4,888)\n Financing activities\n(5,780)\n(7,558)\n(456)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in cash-basis net earnings, largely due to operating gains, partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year working capital movements, including the payment of the European Commission matter. Refer to Note 14, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n for additional information.\nNet Cash Used in/Provided by Investing Activities\nThe reduction in net cash provided by investing activities was largely driven by lapping prior year proceeds from the developed market gum divestiture combined with lower proceeds from the current year JDEP share sale as compared to the prior year KDP and JDEP share sales, higher capital expenditures and cash consideration paid for the Evirth acquisition. Refer to Note 2, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures \nand\n \nNote 7, \nInvestments \nfor more information.\n54\nTable of Contents\nCapital expenditures were $1,387 million in 2024, $1,112 million in 2023 and $906 million in 2022. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2025 capital expenditures to be up to $1.4 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our ERP System Implementation program and for funding our strategic priorities. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher debt proceeds combined with lower debt repayments, partially offset by higher share repurchases and an increase in dividends paid to shareholders in 2024.\nDividends\nWe paid dividends of $2,349 million in 2024, $2,160 million in 2023 and $1,985 million in 2022. On July 30, 2024, the Audit Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.470 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 11 percent, which would be $1.88 per common share on an annualized basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.\nFor U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2024 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. See Note 13, \nCapital Stock\n, to the consolidated financial statements and Item 5, \nMarket for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n, for information on our share repurchase program.\nGuarantees\nAs discussed in Note 14, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.\nDebt\nThe nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.\nAt our July 2024 meeting, the Board of Directors approved a new $2 billion long-term financing authorization that replaced the prior long-term financing authorization of $2 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $1.5 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available.\nOur total debt was $17.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and $19.4 billion at December 31, 2023. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.40 at December 31, 2024 and 0.41 at December 31, 2023. The weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 7.7 years at December 31, 2024 and 7.8 years at December 31, 2023. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $1.1 billion in 2024, $2.1 billion in 2023 and $1.6 billion in 2022.\nOne of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), has outstanding debt. Refer to Note 9, \nDebt and Borrowing Arrangements\n. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 73.1% (or $26.6 billion) of the $36.4 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2024 and represented approximately 81.9% (or $22.1 billion) of the $27.0 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2024.\nRefer to Note 9, \nDebt and Borrowing Arrangements\n, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCommodity Trends\nWe regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2024, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, grains, dairy and packaging costs. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, generally we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will broadly remain available.\nA number of external factors such as the current macroeconomic environment, including global inflation, effects of geopolitical uncertainty, climate and weather conditions, commodity, transportation and labor market conditions, exchange rate volatility and the effects of local and global regulations, including trade policies, governmental agricultural or other programs affect the availability and cost of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. In particular, the supply of cocoa is exposed to many of these factors, including climate change and weather events, local regulations in cocoa-producing countries, and global regulations such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (which requires companies to ensure that the products they place on the EU market or export from it are not associated with deforestation). These factors could impact the supply of cocoa, which could potentially limit our ability to produce our products and significantly impact profitability.\nDuring 2024, price volatility and the higher aggregate cost environment increased due to international supply chain and labor market disruptions and generally higher commodity, transportation and labor costs. We expect these conditions to continue to impact our aggregate commodity costs. In particular, we expect to face higher cocoa costs in the near- and medium-term due to these factors. For example, the market price for cocoa beans on the Intercontinental Exchange in London was 161% higher on the last trading day of the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same day in the fourth quarter of 2023 and it is likely that prices will remain elevated for some time. It is possible that we may not be able to increase prices sufficiently to fully cover the incremental costs of cocoa prices in this environment and/or our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in cocoa costs, which could result in a significant impact on our profitability. \nWe address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible future price decreases. Additionally, our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.\n56\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures along with a discussion of our underlying GAAP results throughout our \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n in this Form 10-K.\nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis \n(1)\n.\n•\n“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures \n(2)\n, short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business \n(3)\n, and currency rate fluctuations \n(4)\n. We believe that Organic net revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP above.\n•\nOur emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Türkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. \n•\nOur developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.\n•\n“Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program\n (5)\n; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture\n (2)\n or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs\n (6)\n, acquisition-related costs \n(7)\n, and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments\n (8)\n; inventory step-up charges \n(9)\n; the operating results of divestitures\n (2)\n; operating results from short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business \n(3)\n; remeasurement of net monetary position\n (10)\n; mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts\n (11)\n; impact from resolution of tax matters\n (12)\n; 2017 malware incident net recoveries; incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine \n(13)\n; impact from the European Commission legal matter \n(14)\n; the impact from pension participation changes\n (15)\n; and operating costs from the ERP System Implementation program \n(16)\n. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis\n (4)\n. We believe these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results.\n•\n“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities \n(17)\n; initial impacts from enacted tax law changes \n(18)\n; and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions \n(19)\n. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis \n(4)\n. We believe Adjusted EPS provides improved comparability of underlying operating results.\n57\nTable of Contents\n(1)\nWhen items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-GAAP definitions. Beginning in Q1 2024, due to a significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso that occurred in December 2023 and the resulting distortion it would cause on our non-GAAP constant currency growth rate measures, we now exclude the impact of pricing in excess of 26% year-over-year (\"extreme pricing\") in Argentina, which is the level at which hyperinflation generally occurs cumulatively over a 3-year period. We have excluded the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from our calculation of Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding adjustment to changes in currency exchange rates. We made this change on a prospective basis due to the distorting effect expected in the current period and future periods following the Argentinian peso devaluation that occurred in December 2023 and did not revise our historical non-GAAP constant currency growth measures. Beginning in Q2 2024, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation program as they represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations (see footnote (16) below).\n(2)\nDivestitures include completed sales of businesses, exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement, the partial or full sale of an equity method investment and changes from equity method investment accounting to accounting for marketable securities. \n(3)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we began to exclude the operating results from short-term distributor agreements that have been executed in conjunction with the sale of a business. We exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\n(4)\nConstant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we also now include within our currency-related impacts a corresponding adjustment associated with the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina.\n(5)\nNon-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments.\n(6)\nDivestiture-related costs, which includes costs incurred in relation to the preparation and completion (including one-time costs such as severance related to the elimination of stranded costs) of our divestitures as defined in footnote (2), also includes costs incurred associated with our publicly-announced processes to sell businesses. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. \n(7)\nAcquisition-related costs, which includes transaction costs such as third party advisor, investment banking and legal fees, also includes one-time compensation expense related to the buyout of non-vested employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) shares and realized gains or losses from hedging activities associated with acquisition funds. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\n(8)\nAcquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments include one-time costs related to the integration of acquisitions as well as any adjustments made to contingent compensation liabilities for earn-outs related to acquisitions that do not relate to recurring employee compensation expense. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. See Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments - Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\n for additional information.\n(9)\nIn the third quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the one-time inventory step-up charges associated with acquired companies related to the fair market valuation of the acquired inventory. We exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\n(10)\nIn connection with our applying highly inflationary accounting (refer to Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n), for Argentina (beginning in the third quarter of 2018), Türkiye (beginning in the second quarter of 2022) and Egypt and Nigeria (beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024), we exclude the related remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in the local currency to the U.S. dollar during the periods presented and the realized gains and losses from derivatives that mitigate the foreign currency volatility related to the remeasurement of the respective net monetary assets or liabilities during the periods presented.\n(11)\nWe exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures. The mark-to-market impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We exclude equity method investment transaction derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures.\n(12)\nSee Note 14, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(13)\nIn February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine and we stopped our production and closed our facilities in Ukraine for a period of time due to damage incurred to our facilities during the invasion. We began to incur incremental costs directly related to the war including asset impairments, such as property and inventory losses, higher expected allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and committed compensation. We have isolated and exclude these costs and related impacts as well as subsequent recoveries from our operating results to facilitate evaluation and comparisons of our ongoing results. Incremental costs related to increasing operations in other primarily European facilities are not included with these costs.\n(14)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the impact from the European Commission legal matter. In November 2019, the European Commission informed us that it initiated an investigation into our alleged infringement of European Union competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the European Economic Area. On January 28, 2021, the European Commission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. As of December 31, 2022, we recorded an estimate of the possible cost to resolve this matter. We have cooperated with the investigation and reached a negotiated, resolution to this matter. We subsequently adjusted our accrual accordingly and fulfilled our payment obligation in August 2024. Due to the unique nature of this matter, we believe it to be infrequent and unusual and therefore exclude it to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. Refer to Note 14, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n for additional information.\n(15)\nThe impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from \n58\nTable of Contents\nour non–GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 11, \nBenefit Plans\n, for additional information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.\n(16)\nIn July 2024, our Board of Directors approved funding of $1.2 billion for a multi-year systems transformation program to upgrade our global ERP and supply chain systems (the “ERP System Implementation”), which is comprised of both capital expenditures and operating expenses, of which a majority is expected to be operating expenses. The ERP System Implementation program will be implemented in several phases with spending occurring over the next five years, with expected completion by year-end 2028. The operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations. These expenses include third-party consulting fees, direct labor costs associated with the program, accelerated depreciation of our existing SAP financial systems and various other expenses, all associated with the implementation of our information technology upgrades. These operating expenses will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures as they are nonrecurring and excluding those costs will better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\n(17)\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we began to exclude mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses, as well as realized gains or losses, associated with our marketable securities from our non-GAAP earnings measures. These marketable securities gains or losses are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\n(18)\nWe have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes. Initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 U.S. tax reform. We exclude initial impacts from enacted tax law changes from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law.\n(19)\nWe exclude gains and losses on equity method transactions including impairments of our equity method investments. In addition, we also exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures any gains or losses realized on economic hedges on sales proceeds from our equity method investment transactions, which have been recorded in \nInterest and other expense, net\n. These items are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measures. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K, which can be found above under \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n.\n59\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets\nWe review our operating segment and reporting unit structure annually or as significant changes in the organization occur for goodwill testing throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. Annually, on July 1, we test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment and may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2024 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.\nAnnually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets. If potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.\nIn 2024, we recorded $153 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to two biscuit brands in the Europe segment, one biscuit brand in the AMEA segment and one candy and one biscuit brand in the Latin America segment. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within \nasset impairment and exit costs\n. We use several accepted valuation methods, including relief from royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. We identified thirteen brands, as part of our annual test, that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. The aggregate value of the thirteen brands was $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2024. We believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to not be impaired, but if plans to grow brand revenue and earnings, and expand margin are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2023, we recorded $26 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a chocolate brand in North America and a biscuit brand in Europe. In 2022, we recorded $101 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to two biscuit brands in AMEA.\nRefer to Note 6, \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n, for additional information.\n60\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combinations\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. We engage third-party valuation specialists to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In determining fair value, we utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being valued. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon the best information available at the date of acquisition. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: expected future cash flows of the acquired business, discount and royalty rates and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names and fixed assets. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates.\nFurther, certain of our acquisitions may include earn-out provisions or other forms of contingent consideration. As of the acquisition date, we record contingent consideration, as applicable, at the estimated fair value of expected future payments associated with the earn-out. Any changes to the recorded fair value of contingent consideration will be recognized as expenses or earnings in the period in which they occur. Such contingent consideration liabilities are based on best estimates of future expected payment obligations, which are subject to change due to many factors outside of our control. Changes to the estimate of expected future contingent consideration payments may occur, from time to time, due to various reasons, including changing discount rates as well as actual results differing from estimates and adjustments to the revenue or earnings assumptions used as the basis for the liability based on historical experience. \nTrade and Marketing Programs\nWe promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. Trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor various employee benefit plans worldwide, including primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.\nWe amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods to reflect the cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost). These changes are deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.\nSince pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. For plans that have assets held in trust, the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 11, \nBenefit Plans\n, along with additional information on our employee benefit plans.\n61\nTable of Contents\nAs a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs:\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n \nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\nFifty-Basis-Point\nFifty-Basis-Point\n \nIncrease\nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\n \n(in millions)\nEffect of change in discount rate on\n   pension costs\n$\n2 \n$\n(2)\n$\n(14)\n$\n19 \nEffect of change in expected rate of return on\n   plan assets on pension costs\n(7)\n7 \n(36)\n36 \nEffect of change in discount rate on\n   postretirement health care costs\n(1)\n1 \n— \n— \nIncome Taxes\nAs a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We review the realizability assessment on a quarterly basis, including impacts from our latest estimates of future taxable income.\nWe believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.\nSee Note 16, \nIncome Taxes\n, for additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.\nContingencies\nSee Note 14, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Guidance\nSee Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.\n62\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. \nAs we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results.\nWe principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments\n.\nMany of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n and \nResults of Operations by Operating Segment\n under \nDiscussion and Analysis of Historical Results\n for currency exchange effects on our financial results. Throughout our discussion and analysis of results, we isolate currency impacts and supplementally provide net revenues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n \n– Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting\n.\nWe also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and the macroeconomic environment. Refer to \nRecent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability\n and \nFinancial Outlook\n above for updates on recent supply chain, labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and impacting our results. To manage input cost volatility and inflation, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.\nWe regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to Secured Overnight Financing Rates (“SOFR”). We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed-rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. For more information on our debt activity, see Note 9, \nDebt and Borrowing Arrangements\n.\nSee Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments\n, for more information on our derivative activity. \nValue at Risk\nWe use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately as of each quarter end for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios using historical market movements. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.\n63\nTable of Contents\nThe VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: \n \nPre-Tax Earnings Impact\nFair Value Impact\n \nAt 12/31/24\nAverage\nHigh\nLow\nAt 12/31/24\nAverage\nHigh\nLow\n \n(in millions)\nInstruments sensitive to:\nInterest rates\n$\n76 \n$\n84 \n$\n95 \n$\n76 \nForeign currency rates\n$\n22 \n$\n34 \n$\n46 \n$\n22 \nCommodity prices\n21 \n49 \n99 \n14 \n \nPre-Tax Earnings Impact\nFair Value Impact\n \nAt 12/31/23\nAverage\nHigh\nLow\nAt 12/31/23\nAverage\nHigh\nLow\n \n(in millions)\nInstruments sensitive to:\nInterest rates\n$\n119 \n$\n144 \n$\n234 \n$\n89 \nForeign currency rates\n$\n14 \n$\n17 \n$\n18 \n$\n14 \nCommodity prices\n21 \n40 \n86 \n18 \nThis VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.\n64\nTable of Contents\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Mondelēz International, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mondelēz International, Inc. and its subsidiaries\n \n(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024\n \nand 2023,\n \nand the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).\n \nWe also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024\n \nand 2023\n, \nand the results of its\n \noperations and its\n \ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023\n \nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated\n \nfinancial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audits of the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Evirth (Shanghai) Industrial Co., Ltd (“Evirth”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded Evirth from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Evirth is a majority-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total net revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 0.37% and 0.19%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n65\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nIndefinite-Life Intangible Assets Annual Impairment Assessments for Certain Brand Names \nAs described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated indefinite-life intangible assets balance was $17.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, which consists principally of brand names. At least annually management assesses indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment and if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, management quantitatively tests the asset for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. Management estimates fair value using several accepted valuation methods, including relief from royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates to determine a brand name’s fair value. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-life intangible assets annual impairment assessments for certain brand names is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible assets for certain brand names; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates for certain brand names; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the indefinite-life intangible assets impairment assessments, including controls over the annual valuation of certain brand names. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible assets for certain brand names; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the valuation methods; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to estimates of future sales and earnings growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the certain brand names; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with \n66\nTable of Contents\nspecialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation methods and (ii) the reasonableness of the royalty rate and discount rate significant assumptions.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 5, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\n67\nTable of

Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nDescription of Business\nMondelēz International, Inc. was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Mondelēz International, Inc., through its subsidiaries (collectively “Mondelēz International,” “we,” “us” and “our”), sells food and beverage products to consumers in over \n150\n countries.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include Mondelēz International, Inc. as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries, except our Venezuelan subsidiaries that were deconsolidated in 2015. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. The noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling investors’ interests in the results of subsidiaries that we control and consolidate. We account for investments over which we exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. Investments over which we do not have significant influence or control are not material and as there is no readily determinable fair value for the equity interests, these investments are carried at cost with changes in the investment recognized to the extent cash is received.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates include valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, restructuring program liabilities, contingent consideration, marketing program accruals, insurance and self-insurance reserves, pension and benefit plan assumptions and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, expectations of future impacts and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment, our estimates could be significantly different than future performance. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the updates in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known.\n \nWar in Ukraine\nIn February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine and we closed our operations and facilities in Ukraine. In March 2022, our \ntwo\n Ukrainian manufacturing facilities in Trostyanets and Vyshhorod were significantly damaged. During the first quarter of 2022, we evaluated and impaired these and other related assets. We recorded $\n143\n million of total expenses ($\n145\n million after-tax) incurred as a direct result of the war. We reversed $\n22\n million during the remainder of 2022 of previously recorded charges primarily as a result of higher than expected collection of trade receivables and inventory recoveries. In the second quarter of 2024, we fully resumed production at both facilities after completing targeted repairs. We continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries and continue to evaluate our ability to control our operating activities and businesses on an ongoing basis. We continue to evaluate the uncertainty of the ongoing effects of the war in Ukraine and its impact on the global economic environment, and we cannot predict if it will have a significant impact in the future.\nCurrency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting\nWe translate the results of operations of our subsidiaries from multiple currencies using average exchange rates during each period and translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency translation adjustments as a component of equity (except for highly inflationary currencies) and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.\nHighly inflationary accounting is triggered when a country’s three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100%. It requires the remeasurement of financial statements of subsidiaries in the country, from the functional currency of the subsidiary to our U.S. dollar reporting currency, with currency remeasurement gains or losses recorded in earnings. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily based on published estimates indicating three-year cumulative inflation rates exceeding 100% for Egypt and Nigeria, we concluded that both countries became highly inflationary economies for accounting purposes. We began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our subsidiaries operating in Egypt and Nigeria and changed their functional currencies from the Egyptian Pound and Nigerian Naira, respectively, to the U.S. dollar during the fourth quarter of 2024. \n73\nTable of Contents\nAt this time, within our consolidated entities, Argentina, Türkiye, Egypt and Nigeria\n \nare accounted for as highly inflationary economies.\n Argentina, Türkiye, Egypt and Nigeria represent \n1.5\n%, \n0.7\n%, \n0.4\n% and \n0.2\n%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. Given the continued volatility of these currencies, impacts to our financial statements in future periods could be significantly different from historical levels.\nThe share of our remeasurement gains/(losses) for the highly inflationary countries are summarized as follows \n(1)\n:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions)\nArgentina\n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n(\n79\n)\n$\n(\n39\n)\nTürkiye\n(\n15\n)\n(\n19\n)\n(\n1\n)\n  Total losses\n$\n(\n32\n)\n$\n(\n98\n)\n$\n(\n40\n)\n(1)\nRemeasurement gains for Egypt and Nigeria were \nnot\n material in 2024.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash primarily includes cash held on behalf of financial institutions in accordance with accounts receivable factoring arrangements and letters of credit arrangements with legally restricted cash collateral provisions.\n Restricted cash is recorded within other current assets and was $\n49\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n74\n million as of December 31, 2023. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $\n1,400\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n1,884\n million as of December 31, 2023.\nAllowances for Credit Losses\nAllowances for credit losses are recorded against our receivables. They are developed at a country and region level based on historical collection experiences, current economic condition of specific customers and the forecasted economic condition of countries using various factors such as bond default rates and consumption indexes. We write off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws.\nChanges in allowances for credit losses consisted of:\nAllowance for Trade Receivables\nAllowance for Other Current Receivables\nAllowance for Long-Term Receivables\n \n(in millions)\nBalance at January 1, 2023\n$\n(\n45\n)\n$\n(\n59\n)\n$\n(\n14\n)\nNet (provision)/recovery for expected credit losses\n(\n24\n)\n4\n \n1\n \nWrite-offs charged against the allowance\n8\n \n1\n \n—\n \nRecoveries of amounts previously written off\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nCurrency\n(\n4\n)\n4\n \n(\n1\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n(\n66\n)\n(\n50\n)\n(\n15\n)\nNet recovery/(provision) for expected credit losses\n14\n \n9\n \n(\n2\n)\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance\n3\n \n1\n \n5\n \nCurrency\n12\n \n3\n \n(\n4\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n(\n37\n)\n$\n(\n37\n)\n$\n(\n16\n)\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nWe account for transfers of financial assets, such as uncommitted revolving non-recourse accounts receivable factoring arrangements, when we have surrendered control over the related assets. We use receivable factoring arrangements periodically when circumstances are favorable to manage liquidity. We have nonrecourse factoring arrangements in which we sell eligible trade receivables primarily to financial institutions in exchange for cash. We may continue to collect the receivables sold, acting solely as a collecting agent on behalf of the financial institutions.\n The outstanding principal amount of receivables under these arrangements amounted to $\n159\n million as of December 31, 2024, $\n262\n million as of December 31, 2023 and $\n516\n million as of December 31, 2022. The \n74\nTable of Contents\nincremental costs of factoring receivables under these arrangements were not material for all periods presented. The proceeds from the sales of receivables are included in cash from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nInventories\nWe record our inventory using the average cost method and record inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets with the expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the long-lived assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from \n3\n to \n20\n years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to \n40\n years.\nWe review long-lived assets, including definite-life intangible assets, for realizability on an ongoing basis. Changes in depreciation, generally accelerated depreciation, are determined and recorded when estimates of the remaining useful lives or residual values of long-term assets change. We amortize definite-life intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and evaluate them for impairment as we do other long-lived assets. We review for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. In those circumstances, we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses for asset groups at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable to determine if an impairment exists. Any impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. Fair value is estimated based on the discounted cash flows for the asset group over the remaining useful life or based on the expected cash proceeds for the asset less costs of disposal.\nLeases\nWe determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. For short-term operating leases with terms of 12 months or less, we do not recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the lease liability, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. The non-recurring fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 as no fair value inputs are observable. As the implicit interest rate in the lease is not readily determinable, we use our country-specific incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease liabilities. \nOur leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease, which are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Many of our leases contain non-lease components (e.g., product costs, common-area or other maintenance costs) that relate to the lease components of the agreement. We account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. \nAmortization of ROU lease assets is calculated over the lease term with the expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the leased item. Interest expense is recorded over the lease term and is recorded in interest expense (based on a front-loaded interest expense pattern) for finance leases and is recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses for operating leases. Variable lease payments, which are primarily comprised of product costs, insurance and tax payments based on usage or output, are recognized when the expense is incurred. Finance lease ROU assets are presented in property, plant and equipment and the related finance lease liabilities are presented in the current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt.\n \nInternal Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed \nseven years\n.\nCloud Computing Arrangements\nWe capitalize certain implementation costs of cloud computing arrangements during the application-development stage, consistent with the capitalization criteria used for internal use software. Capitalized costs are recorded to other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and within net cash provided by operating activities on the \n75\nTable of Contents\nconsolidated statement of cash flows. Capitalized cloud computing arrangement implementation costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the contract.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nAnnually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets. If potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. During our annual testing, we use several accepted valuation methods, including relief from royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. The results of operations of an acquired business are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition. \nFurther, certain of our acquisitions may include earn-out provisions or other forms of contingent consideration. As of the acquisition date, we record contingent consideration, as applicable, at the estimated fair value of expected future payments associated with the earn-out. Any changes to the recorded fair value of contingent consideration will be recognized as expenses or earnings in the period in which they occur.\nLegal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\nEquity Method Investments\nEquity method investments consist of our investments in entities in which we maintain an equity ownership interest and apply the equity method of accounting due to our ability to exert significant influence over decisions relating to their operating and financial affairs. Revenue and expenses of our equity method investees are not consolidated into our financial statements; rather, our proportionate share of the earnings of each investee is reflected as equity method investment net earnings. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also impacted by our proportionate share of items impacting the investee's accumulated other comprehensive income or losses and other items, such as our share of investee dividends.\nInsurance and Self-Insurance\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee healthcare benefits. We estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis by evaluating and making judgments about historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions and the estimated impact on future results.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when control over the products transfers to our customers, which generally occurs upon delivery or shipment of the products. We account for product shipping, handling and insurance as fulfillment activities with revenues for these activities recorded within net revenue and costs recorded within cost of sales. Any taxes collected on behalf of government authorities are excluded from net revenues. \n76\nTable of Contents\nRevenues are recorded net of trade and sales incentives and estimated product returns. Known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. We base these estimates of expected amounts principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. Estimates that affect revenue, such as trade incentives and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentives or product returns are realized.\nKey sales terms, such as pricing and quantities ordered, are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one year or shorter duration. As such, we do not capitalize contract inception costs and we capitalize product fulfillment costs. Deferred revenues are not material and primarily include customer advance payments typically collected a few days before product delivery, at which time deferred revenues are reclassified and recorded as net revenues. We generally do not receive non-cash consideration for the sale of goods nor do we grant payment financing terms greater than one year.\nMarketing, Advertising and Research and Development\nWe promote our products with marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. For interim reporting purposes, advertising, consumer promotion and marketing research expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.\n Advertising expense was $\n2,112\n million in 2024, $\n2,057\n million in 2023 and $\n1,670\n million in 2022. We expense product research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $\n400\n million in 2024, $\n380\n million in 2023 and $\n346\n million in 2022. We record marketing and advertising as well as research and development expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe maintain a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives, including stock options (including stock appreciation rights), deferred stock units (DSUs) and performance share units (PSUs). Stock compensation expense is amortized to expense over the vesting period, generally \nthree years\n. \nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our Common Stock on the grant date. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in \nthree\n annual installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire \n10\n years from the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes Model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is based on the implied and historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.\nDSUs are typically granted to selected management employees on an annual basis and vest over \nthree years\n. Dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period for DSUs granted prior to February 27, 2024. For DSUs granted on or after February 27, 2024, dividend equivalents accumulated over the vesting period are paid after vesting. The fair value of our DSUs and other stock-based awards is measured at the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date.\nPSUs vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions. Dividend equivalents accumulated over the vesting period are paid after vesting. The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based component and the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date for performance-based components. The final award may equal \n0\n-\n200\n percent of the target grant, based on the achievement of the performance and market-based components\n.\nForfeitures are estimated on the grant date for all of our stock-based compensation awards.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees including pension benefits, defined contribution plan benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment primarily severance-related benefits depending upon local statutory requirements, employee tenure and service requirements as well as other factors. The cost for these plans is recognized in earnings primarily over the working life of the covered employee.\n77\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Instruments\nWe use financial instruments to manage our currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. A principal objective of our risk management strategies is to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments, derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our instruments are recorded within other current assets, other assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nMark-to-market gains or losses related to our economic hedges are separately presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as hedges of net investments in non-U.S. operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. Cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated or settled economic hedges are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities.\nCommodity derivatives\n. We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward, futures, option and swap contracts. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We sell commodity futures to hedge future purchase commitments. We occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes. Any mark-to-market gains or losses are recorded in earnings (see Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments\n, for additional information). \nCurrency exchange derivatives\n. We enter into currency exchange forward, futures, option and swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. Any mark-to-market gains or losses are recorded in earnings (see Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments\n, for additional information). \nInterest rate cash flow hedges\n. We manage interest rate volatility by modifying the pricing or maturity characteristics of certain liabilities so that the net impact on expense is not, on a material basis, adversely affected by movements in interest rates. We use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps that have indices related to the pricing of specific liabilities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. We use cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge interest payments on newly issued debt denominated in a different currency than the functional currency of the borrowing entity. Substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses), net of deferred taxes, and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings (see Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments\n, for additional information). \nHedges of net investments in non-U.S. operations\n. We have numerous investments outside the United States. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to changes and volatility in currency exchange rates. We use local currency denominated debt to hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. We may designate non-U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings in the U.S. as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall non-U.S. operations. The gains and losses on our net investment in these designated non-U.S. operations are economically offset by losses and gains designated dollar-denominated borrowings. The revaluation of designated borrowings, net of deferred taxes, is recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) (see Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments\n, for additional information).\n78\nTable of Contents\nWe use derivatives instruments to hedge certain investments in our non-U.S. operations against movements in exchange rates. These instruments may include cross-currency interest rate swaps, forwards and options. The after-tax gain/(loss) on these net investment hedge contracts, net of deferred taxes, is recorded within cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) (see Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments\n, for additional information).\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes includes amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effects of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of our assets and liabilities, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse.\nThe realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider any carryback potential, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences (including liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits), future taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nWe recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. Future changes related to the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions could affect tax expense in the period when the change occurs.\nWe monitor for changes in tax laws and reflect the impacts of tax law changes in the period of enactment. When there is refinement to tax law changes in subsequent periods, we account for the new guidance in the period when it becomes known.\nSupply Chain Financing\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers are from \n30\n to \n180\n days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We also facilitate voluntary supply chain financing (“SCF”) programs through several participating financial institutions. Under these programs, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine invoices that they want to sell to participating financial institutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in SCF programs has no bearing on our payment terms or amounts due. Our responsibility is limited to making payments based upon the agreed-upon contractual terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF programs and we have no economic interest in the suppliers’ decision to participate in the SCF programs. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in \naccounts payable\n in our consolidated balance sheets.\n \nThe roll-forward of our outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under our SCF program are as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n(in millions)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the beginning of the year\n$\n2,387\n \nNew invoices confirmed during the year\n10,378\n \nConfirmed invoices paid during the year \n(\n9,133\n)\nCurrency\n(\n123\n)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the end of the year\n$\n3,509\n \n79\nTable of Contents\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued an ASU which enhances the transparency of supplier finance programs by requiring additional disclosure about the key terms of these programs and a roll-forward of the related obligations to understand the effects of these programs on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the roll-forward requirement, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted, with the exception of the roll-forward requirement in the first quarter of 2023 and the subsequent roll-forward requirement on a prospective basis in the fourth quarter of 2024. This adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued an ASU which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this standard, retrospectively to all comparative periods, in the fourth quarter of 2024 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related segment disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued an ASU which enhances the transparency of income tax disclosures, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued an ASU which requires incremental disclosures in the notes to the financial statements to disaggregate certain income statement expense line items. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n80\nTable of Contents\nNote 2.   Acquisitions and Divestitures\n \nAcquisitions\nEvirth\nOn November 1, 2024, we acquired Evirth (Shanghai) Industrial Co., Ltd. (“Evirth”), a leading manufacturer of cakes and pastries in China. The acquisition will continue to expand our growth in the cakes and pastries categories. The cash consideration paid for Evirth totaled ¥\n1.7\n billion ($\n240\n million), net of cash received.\nWe are working to complete the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and have recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2024.\nWithin definite-lived intangible assets, we allocated $\n117\n million to customer relationships which have an estimated useful life of \n17\n years. The fair value of customer relationships at the acquisition date was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. The fair value measurements are based on significant unobservable inputs, and thus represent Level 3 inputs. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair values of the intangible assets include discounted cash flows, customer attrition rates and discount rates.\nGoodwill of $\n122\n million was determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and arises principally as a result of expansion opportunities and synergies across China. \nNone\n of the goodwill recognized will be deductible for income tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to the AMEA operating segment. For further detail, refer to \nNote 6. Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\nWe incurred acquisition integration and contingent consideration adjustment costs of $\n8\n million, acquisition-related costs of $\n3\n million and an inventory step-up charge of $\n3\n million in 2024.\nRicolino\nOn November 1, 2022, we acquired \n100\n% of the equity of Grupo Bimbo's confectionery business, Ricolino, located primarily in Mexico. The acquisition of Ricolino builds on our continued prioritization of fast-growing snacking segments in key geographies. The cash consideration paid for Ricolino totaled \n26\n billion Mexican pesos ($\n1.3\n billion), net of cash received. \nWe incurred acquisition integration costs of $\n21\n million in 2024, $\n50\n million in 2023 and $\n11\n million in 2022. In 2022, we also incurred an inventory step-up charge of $\n5\n million and recorded several items within acquisition-related costs that resulted in income of $\n64\n million as realized gains related to hedging contracts associated with acquisition funds more than offset other acquisition transaction costs.\n \nClif Bar\nOn August 1, 2022, we acquired \n100\n% of the equity of Clif Bar & Company (“Clif Bar”), a leading U.S. maker of nutritious energy bars with organic ingredients. The acquisition expands our global snack bar business and complements our refrigerated snacking and performance nutrition bar portfolios. The total cash payment of $\n2.9\n billion includes purchase price consideration of $\n2.6\n billion, net of cash received, and one-time compensation expense of $\n0.3\n billion related to the buyout of the non-vested employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") shares. This compensation expense is considered an acquisition-related cost. We also incurred a contingent consideration liability with an acquisition date fair value of $\n440\n million.\nWe recorded a net gain in acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments of $\n393\n million in 2024 and incurred acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments of $\n164\n million in 2023 and $\n30\n million in 2022. Refer to Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments\n for additional information on the changes to the contingent consideration liability. We also incurred acquisition-related costs of $\n296\n million, primarily related to the buyout of the non-vested ESOP shares, and an inventory step-up charge of $\n20\n million in 2022. \nChipita\nOn January 3, 2022, we acquired \n100\n% of the equity of Chipita Global S.A. (“Chipita”), a leading croissants and baked snacks company in the Central and Eastern European markets. The acquisition of Chipita offers a strategic complement to our existing portfolio and advances our strategy to become the global leader in broader snacking. The cash consideration paid for Chipita totaled €\n1.2\n billion ($\n1.4\n billion), net of cash received, plus the assumption of Chipita’s debt of €\n0.4\n billion ($\n0.4\n billion) for a total purchase price of €\n1.7\n billion ($\n1.8\n billion). \n81\nTable of Contents\nWe incurred acquisition integration costs of $\n20\n million in 2024, $\n17\n million in 2023 and $\n90\n million in 2022. We incurred acquisition-related costs of $\n22\n million in 2022.\nDivestitures\nDeveloped Market Gum \nOn October 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our developed market gum business in the United States, Canada and Europe to Perfetti Van Melle Group, excluding the Portugal business which we retained pending regulatory approval. After obtaining the regulatory approval, we completed the sale of the Portugal business to Perfetti Van Melle Group on \nOctober 23, 2023\n. We received cash proceeds of $\n1.4\n billion. We recorded a \npre-tax gain\n of $\n108\n million on the sale. We recorded divestiture-related costs of \n$\n1\n million in 2024,\n $\n83\n million in \n2023\n and $\n15\n million in \n2022\n.\nThis disposition was not considered a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations or financial results; therefore, the results of the disposed business were not classified as discontinued operations.\nNote 3.

Definite-life intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, customer-related intangibles, process technology, licenses and non-compete agreements. \nAmortization expense for intangible assets was $\n153\n million in 2024, $\n151\n million in 2023 and $\n132\n million in 2022. For the next five years, we estimate annual amortization expense of approximately $\n135\n million in 2025, $\n110\n million in 2026, $\n90\n million in 2027 and $\n85\n million in 2028 and 2029 (reflecting December 31, 2024 exchange rates).\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were \nno\n goodwill impairments and each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of its carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.\nIn 2024, we recorded $\n153\n million of intangible asset impairment charges related to \ntwo\n biscuit brands in the Europe segment, one biscuit brand in the AMEA segment and one candy and one biscuit brand in the Latin America segment. We identified \nthirteen\n brands, as part of our annual test, that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. The aggregate value of the \nthirteen\n brands was $\n2.9\n billion as of December 31, 2024. We believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to not be impaired, but if plans to grow brand revenue and earnings, and expand margin are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future.\nIn 2023, we recorded $\n26\n million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a chocolate brand in North America and a biscuit brand in Europe. In 2022, we recorded $\n101\n million of intangible asset impairment charges related to \ntwo\n biscuit brands in AMEA.\n85\nTable of Contents\nNote 7.   Investments\nEquity Method Investments\nOur equity method investments include, but are not limited to, our ownership interests in Dong Suh Foods Corporation and Dong Suh Oil & Fats Co. Ltd. Our ownership interests may change over time due to investee stock-based compensation arrangements, share issuances or other equity-related transactions. As of December 31, 2024, we owned \n50.0\n% and \n49.0\n%, respectively, of these companies' outstanding shares.\nOn November 29, 2024, we sold our remaining \n85.9\n million shares in JDE Peet’s (Euronext Amsterdam: “JDEP”) to JAB Holdings Company. We received €\n2.2\n billion ($\n2.3\n billion) of proceeds at a price of €\n25.10\n per share and recorded a gain on equity method investment transactions of €\n313\n million ($\n332\n million) during 2024. As a result of this transaction, we have fully exited our investment in the company.\nOur investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting totaled\n \n$\n0.6\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n3.2\n billion as of December 31, 2023. The investment balance as of December 31, 2023 is inclusive of our prior investment in JDEP. We recorded equity earnings and cash dividends of $\n168\n million and $\n115\n million in 2024, equity earnings and cash dividends of $\n160\n million and $\n137\n million in 2023 and equity earnings and cash dividends of $\n385\n million and $\n184\n million in 2022.\nAdditional JDEP Transactions\nIn 2024, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment for JDEP based on the period of time for which the quoted market price fair value had been less than the carrying value of the investment and the uncertainty surrounding JDEP's stock price recovering to the carrying value. As a result, the investment was written down to its estimated fair value based on the closing price of the underlying equity security of €\n19.46\n per share on March 28, 2024, resulting in an impairment charge of €\n612\n million ($\n665\n million). This charge was included within \n(Loss)/gain on equity method investment transactions \nin the consolidated statement of earnings.\nIn 2023, we sold approximately \n9.9\n million shares of JDEP, which reduced our ownership interest by \n2.0\n percentage points, from \n19.7\n% to \n17.7\n%. We received cash proceeds of €\n255\n million ($\n279\n million) and recorded a loss of €\n21\n million ($\n23\n million). \nIn 2022, we sold approximately \n18.6\n million of our JDEP shares back to JDEP, which reduced our ownership interest by approximately \n3.0\n percentage points. We received cash proceeds of €\n500\n million ($\n529\n million) and recorded a loss of €\n8\n million ($\n8\n million) on this sale during 2022.\nMarketable Securities\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, our ownership in Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (Nasdaq: \"KDP\") fell to below \n5\n% of the outstanding shares, resulting in a change of accounting for our KDP investment, from equity method investment accounting to accounting for equity interests with readily determinable fair values (\"marketable securities\") as we no longer retained significant influence. Marketable securities are measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1).\nSubsequently in 2023, we sold the remainder of our shares of KDP and exited our investment in the company. In total during 2023, we sold approximately \n76\n million shares and received proceeds of $\n2.4\n billion.\n86\nTable of Contents\nPre-tax gains for marketable securities are summarized below:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n \n(in millions)\nGain on marketable securities sold during the period\n$\n593\n \nDividend income and other\n13\n \nTotal gain on marketable securities\n$\n606\n \nIn the table above, gain on marketable securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the date of the change of accounting for our investment in KDP.\nPrior to the change of accounting for our KDP investment, we recorded a pre-tax gain on equity method transactions of $\n493\n million ($\n368\n million after-tax) during 2023.\nNote 8.   Restructuring Program \nOn May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a $\n3.5\n billion 2014-2018 restructuring program and up to $\n2.2\n billion of capital expenditures. On August 31, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $\n600\n million reallocation between restructuring program cash costs and capital expenditures so the $\n5.7\n billion program consisted of approximately $\n4.1\n billion of restructuring program costs ($\n3.1\n billion cash costs and $\n1.0\n billion non-cash costs) and up to $\n1.6\n billion of capital expenditures. On September 6, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an extension of the restructuring program through 2022, an increase of $\n1.3\n billion in the program charges and an increase of $\n700\n million in capital expenditures. On October 21, 2021, our Board of Directors approved an extension of the restructuring program through 2023, and on July 25, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a further extension of the restructuring program through December 31, 2024. The total $\n7.7\n billion program consisted of $\n5.4\n billion of program charges ($\n4.1\n billion of cash costs and $\n1.3\n billion of non-cash costs) and total capital expenditures of $\n2.3\n billion incurred over the life of the program. This restructuring program, as increased and extended by these actions, was the Simplify to Grow Program.\nThe primary objective of the Simplify to Grow Program, which ended on December 31, 2024, was to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. The program covered severance as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing and procurement-related one-time costs. Since inception, we incurred total restructuring and related implementation charges of $\n5.4\n billion related to the Simplify to Grow Program.\nRestructuring Costs\nThe Simplify to Grow Program liability activity for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was:\nSeverance\nand related\ncosts\nAsset\nWrite-downs and Other \n(1)\nTotal\n \n(in millions)\nLiability Balance, January 1, 2023\n$\n164\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n164\n \nCharges\n (2)\n89\n \n17\n \n106\n \nCash spent\n (3)\n(\n67\n)\n—\n \n(\n67\n)\nNon-cash items \n(4)\n—\n \n(\n17\n)\n(\n17\n)\nCurrency\n5\n \n—\n \n5\n \nLiability Balance, December 31, 2023\n191\n \n—\n \n191\n \nCharges \n(2)\n56\n \n21\n \n77\n \nCash spent\n (3)\n(\n48\n)\n—\n \n(\n48\n)\nNon-cash items\n (4)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n22\n)\nCurrency\n(\n10\n)\n—\n \n(\n10\n)\nLiability balance, December 31, 2024 \n(5)\n$\n188\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n188\n \n(1)\nIncludes asset write-downs, net of gains on assets sold which were included in the restructuring program.\n(2)\nWe recorded restructuring charges of $\n77\n million in 2024, $\n106\n million in 2023 and $\n36\n million in 2022 within \nasset impairment and exit costs \nand \nbenefit plan non-service income\n. \n87\nTable of Contents\n(3)\nWe spent $\n48\n million in 2024 and $\n67\n million in 2023 in cash severance and related costs. \n(4)\nWe recognized non-cash asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments) and other non-cash adjustments, including gains on sales of restructuring program assets, which totaled a charge of $\n22\n million in 2024 and $\n17\n million in 2023.\n \n(5)\nAt December 31, 2024, $\n115\n million of our net restructuring liability was recorded within \nother current liabilities\n and $\n73\n million was recorded within \nother long-term liabilities\n.\nImplementation Costs\nImplementation costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. We believe the disclosure of implementation costs provides readers of our financial statements with more information on the total costs of our Simplify to Grow Program. Implementation costs primarily related to reorganizing our operations and facilities in connection with our supply chain reinvention program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs included incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and the simplification of our information systems. Within our continuing results of operations, we recorded implementation costs of $\n72\n million in 2024, $\n25\n million in 2023 and $\n87\n million in 2022. We recorded these costs within \ncost of sales\n and general corporate expense within \nselling, general and administrative expenses\n.\nRestructuring and Implementation Costs in Operating Income\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, and since inception of the Simplify to Grow Program, we recorded the following restructuring and implementation costs within segment operating income and earnings before income taxes:\n \nLatin\nAmerica\nAMEA\nEurope\nNorth\nAmerica\nCorporate\nTotal\n \n(in millions)\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nRestructuring Costs\n$\n16\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n77\n \nImplementation Costs\n2\n \n1\n \n20\n \n32\n \n17\n \n72\n \nTotal\n$\n18\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n50\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n149\n \nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nRestructuring Costs\n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n7\n \n$\n79\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n106\n \nImplementation Costs\n1\n \n—\n \n12\n \n8\n \n4\n \n25\n \nTotal\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n7\n \n$\n91\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n131\n \nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nRestructuring Costs\n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n13\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n36\n \nImplementation Costs\n7\n \n6\n \n25\n \n37\n \n12\n \n87\n \nTotal\n$\n1\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n41\n \n$\n49\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n123\n \nTotal Project\n(Inception to Date)\nRestructuring Costs\n$\n561\n \n$\n570\n \n$\n1,279\n \n$\n694\n \n$\n151\n \n$\n3,255\n \nImplementation Costs\n306\n \n246\n \n601\n \n630\n \n389\n \n2,172\n \nTotal\n$\n867\n \n$\n816\n \n$\n1,880\n \n$\n1,324\n \n$\n540\n \n$\n5,427\n \n88\nTable of Contents\nNote 9.

The revolving credit agreements include a covenant that we maintain a minimum shareholders' equity of at least $\n25.0\n billion, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses), the cumulative effects of any changes in accounting principles and earnings/(losses) recognized in connection with the ongoing application of any mark-to-market accounting for pensions and other retirement plans. At December 31, 2024, we complied with this covenant as our shareholders' equity, as defined by the covenant, was $\n39.4\n billion. The revolving credit facility also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default.

The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter (“OTC”) currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.\n93\nTable of Contents\nDerivative Volume\nThe gross notional values of our derivative instruments were:\n \nNotional Amount\n \nAs of December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(in millions)\nCurrency exchange contracts:\nIntercompany loans and forecasted interest payments\n$\n4,406\n \n$\n2,860\n \nForecasted transactions\n9,132\n \n5,550\n \nCommodity contracts\n16,210\n \n16,631\n \nInterest rate contracts\n5,336\n \n2,384\n \nNet investment hedges:\nNet investment hedge derivative contracts\n8,647\n \n7,456\n \nNon-U.S. dollar debt designated as net investment hedges:\nEuro notes\n3,298\n \n3,516\n \nSwiss franc notes\n220\n \n386\n \nCanadian dollar notes\n869\n \n453\n \nCash Flow Hedges\nCash flow hedge activity, net of taxes, is recorded within accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).

The possible payments range from \nzero\n to a maximum total of $\n2.4\n billion, with higher payouts requiring the achievement of targets that generate rates of returns in excess of the base financial projections. The contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value within long-term liabilities.

Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the liability include financial projections for net revenue, gross profit, and EBITDA, as well as discount and volatility rates.

Year-end discount rates for our remaining non-U.S. plans were developed from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year. \nFor the periods presented, we measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along a yield curve used to measure plan obligations to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. \nMondelēz Global LLC Retirement Plan Update\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement with \ntwo\n third party insurance companies for the Mondelēz Global LLC Retirement Plan (“MDLZ Global Plan”), the pension plan for US salaried employees. The agreement features a buy-in of the plan assets with an option to elect a future buy-out conversion. As part of the buy-in, all of the MDLZ Global Plan assets were transferred to the insurance companies in exchange for an annuity contract during the third quarter of 2024 to further reduce the risk of plan asset value volatility. The annuity contract provides all future benefit plan payments to the MDLZ Global Plan participants upon execution of the plan amendment to terminate the plan. However, we continue to retain the primary benefit obligation until the buy-out conversion is completed. Upon election of the buy-out conversion, we will transfer full responsibility of the MDLZ Global Plan obligations to the insurance companies, at which time we will derecognize the assets and liabilities of the pension plan and realize a settlement loss as a component of net periodic pension cost.\nThe plan amendment to terminate the MDLZ Global Plan was executed on December 31, 2024 and we intend to execute the buy-out conversion in 2025. \n98\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Net Periodic Pension Cost\nNet periodic pension cost consisted of the following:\n \nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions)\nService cost\n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n59\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n88\n \nInterest cost\n60\n \n64\n \n51\n \n283\n \n303\n \n172\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n89\n)\n(\n99\n)\n(\n79\n)\n(\n428\n)\n(\n403\n)\n(\n353\n)\nAmortization:\nNet loss\n—\n \n—\n \n6\n \n64\n \n42\n \n57\n \nPrior service cost/(benefit)\n1\n \n1\n \n1\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\nCurtailment expense/(credit)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n8\n \nSettlement losses and other expenses\n14\n \n17\n \n14\n \n1\n \n1\n \n2\n \nNet periodic pension benefit\n$\n(\n11\n)\n$\n(\n14\n)\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n(\n22\n)\n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n(\n28\n)\nWe determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.

Level 2 plan assets also include corporate bonds and other fixed-income securities, valued using independent observable market inputs, such as matrix pricing, yield curves and indices.\n•\nLevel 3 – includes investments valued using unobservable inputs that reflect the plans’ assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets, based on the best information available.\n•\nFair value estimates for pooled funds are calculated by the investment advisor when reliable quotations or pricing services are not readily available for certain underlying securities. The estimated value is based on either cost or last sale price for most of the securities valued in this fashion.\n•\nFair value estimates for private equity investments are calculated by the general partners using the market approach to estimate the fair value of private investments. The market approach utilizes prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions, type of security, degree of liquidity, restrictions on the disposition, latest round of financing data, company financial statements, relevant valuation multiples and discounted cash flow analyses.\n•\nFair value estimates for private debt placements are calculated using standardized valuation methods, including income-based techniques such as discounted cash flow projections or market-based techniques utilizing public and private transaction multiples as comparables.\n•\nFair value estimates for real estate investments are calculated by investment managers using the present value of future cash flows expected to be received from the investments, based on valuation methodologies such as appraisals, local market conditions, and current and projected operating performance.\n•\nFair value estimates for buy-in annuity policies (excluding the MDLZ Global Plan buy-in) are calculated on a replacement policy value basis by discounting the projected cash flows of the plan members using a discount rate based on risk-free rates and adjustments for estimated levels of insurer pricing. Fair value of the MDLZ Global Plan buy-in annuity is set equal to the estimated contract value as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nNet asset value – primarily includes equity funds, fixed income funds, real estate funds, hedge funds and private equity investments for which net asset values are normally used.\nChanges in our Level 3 plan assets included:\nAsset Category\nJanuary 1, \n2024\nBalance\nNet Realized\nand Unrealized\nGains/\n(Losses)\nNet Purchases,\nIssuances and\nSettlements\nNet Transfers\nInto/(Out of)\nLevel 3\nCurrency\nImpact\nDecember 31, \n2024\nBalance\n \n(in millions)\nBuy-in annuity contracts and other\n$\n1,471\n \n$\n(\n62\n)\n$\n702\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n29\n)\n$\n2,082\n \nReal estate\n62\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n63\n \nPrivate equity and other\n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n4\n \nTotal Level 3 investments\n$\n1,536\n \n$\n(\n62\n)\n$\n702\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n27\n)\n$\n2,149\n \nAsset Category\nJanuary 1, \n2023\nBalance\nNet Realized\nand Unrealized\nGains/\n(Losses)\nNet Purchases,\nIssuances and\nSettlements\nNet Transfers\nInto/(Out of)\nLevel 3\nCurrency\nImpact\nDecember 31, \n2023\nBalance\n \n(in millions)\nBuy-in annuity contracts and other\n$\n1,540\n \n$\n60\n \n$\n(\n227\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n98\n \n$\n1,471\n \nReal estate\n70\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n6\n)\n62\n \nPrivate equity and other\n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n3\n \nTotal Level 3 investments\n$\n1,614\n \n$\n58\n \n$\n(\n227\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n91\n \n$\n1,536\n \nThe increase in Level 3 pension plan investments during 2024 was related to net purchases, issuances and settlements, including the purchase of the MDLZ Global Plan buy-in annuity, partially offset by a decreased return on plan assets and currency impact.

For our remaining U.S. plans, our investment strategy is to reduce our funded status risk in part through appropriate asset allocation within our plan assets. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make monthly benefit payments. The strategy involves using indexed U.S. equity and international equity securities and actively managed U.S. investment grade fixed-income securities (which constitute \n95\n% or more of fixed-income securities) with smaller allocations to high yield fixed-income securities.\nFor our non-U.S. plans, the investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. In aggregate, the asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately \n13\n% equity securities, \n56\n% fixed-income securities, \n27\n% buy-in annuity contracts and \n4\n% real estate. \nEmployer Contributions\nIn 2024, we contributed $\n4\n million to our U.S. pension plans and $\n86\n million to our non-U.S. pension plans. In addition, employees contributed $\n23\n million to our non-U.S. plans. We make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local funding arrangements and statutory minimum funding requirements. Discretionary contributions are made to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability. In 2025, we estimate that our pension contributions will be $\n11\n million to our U.S. plans and $\n68\n million to our non-U.S. plans based on current tax laws. Our actual contributions may be different due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.\nFuture Benefit Payments\nThe estimated future benefit payments from our pension plans at December 31, 2024 were (in millions):\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030-2034\nU.S. Plans\n$\n945\n$\n17\n$\n18\n$\n18\n$\n19\n$\n103\nNon-U.S. Plans\n414\n414\n420\n422\n429\n2,204\nThe increase in estimated benefit payments for U.S. plans in 2025 is reflective of the expected MDLZ Global Plan buy-out.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nIn accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements, we made contributions to multiemployer pension plans for continuing participation and these amounts were not material. Our contributions are based on our contribution rates under our collective bargaining agreements, the number of our eligible employees and fund surcharges.\nOn July 11, 2019, we received a withdrawal liability assessment from the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund and recorded a discounted liability of $\n491\n million requiring pro-rata monthly payments over \n20\n years beginning in the third quarter of 2019. Within \ninterest and other expense, net\n, we recorded accreted interest of $\n10\n million in 2024, $\n10\n million in 2023 and $\n11\n million 2022.

These plans cover eligible salaried, non-union and union employees. Our contributions and costs are determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by the plans.

Year-end discount rates for our remaining non-U.S. plans were developed from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs.\n103\nTable of Contents\nFor the periods presented, we measure service and interest costs for other postretirement benefits by applying the specific spot rates along a yield curve used to measure plan obligations to the plans’ liability cash flows.

Repurchases under the program are determined by management and are wholly discretionary. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately $\n1.6\n billion of Common Stock pursuant to this authorization. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately \n36\n million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of $\n65.51\n per share, or an aggregate cost of approximately $\n2.4\n billion, all of which was paid during the period except for approximately $\n67\n million settled in January 2025. All share repurchases were funded through available cash and commercial paper issuances. On December 10, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new program authorizing the repurchase of up to $\n9.0\n billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2027. This authorization, effective January 1, 2025, replaced our prior share repurchase program.\n108\nTable of Contents\nNote 14.   Commitments and Contingencies \nLegal Proceedings\nWe routinely are involved in various pending or threatened legal proceedings, claims, disputes, regulatory matters and governmental inquiries, inspections or investigations arising in the ordinary course of or incidental to our business, including those noted below in this section. We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending legal matters when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For matters we have not provided for that are reasonably possible to result in an unfavorable outcome, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss or such amounts have been determined to be immaterial. At present we believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and regulatory and governmental matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, legal proceedings and regulatory and governmental matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could involve substantial fines, civil or criminal penalties, and other expenditures. In addition, in matters for which conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices or requiring other equitable remedies. An unfavorable outcome might result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial position.\nOn April 1, 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") filed a complaint against Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global LLC (“Mondelēz Global”) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the \"District Court\") related to the trading of December 2011 wheat futures contracts that occurred prior to the spin-off of Kraft Foods Group. The complaint alleged that Mondelēz Global: (1) manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the fall of 2011; (2) violated position limit levels for wheat futures; and (3) engaged in non-competitive trades. On May 13, 2022, the District Court approved a settlement agreement between the CFTC and Mondelēz Global. The terms of the settlement, which are available in the District Court’s docket, had an immaterial impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and did not include an admission by Mondelēz Global. Several class action complaints also were filed against Mondelēz Global in the District Court by investors who copied and expanded upon the CFTC allegations in a series of private claims for monetary damages as well as injunctive, declaratory, and other unspecified relief. In June 2015, these suits were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois as case number 15-cv-2937, Harry Ploss et al. v. Kraft Foods Group, Inc. and Mondelēz Global LLC. On January 3, 2020, the District Court granted plaintiffs' request to certify a class. In November 2022, the District Court adjourned the trial date it had previously set for November 30, 2022 and ordered the parties to brief Kraft’s motions to decertify the class and for summary judgment, which has been completed. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters; however, based on our Separation and Distribution Agreement with Kraft Foods Group dated as of September 27, 2012, we expect to bear any monetary penalties or other payments in connection with the class action.\nAs previously disclosed, in November 2019, the European Commission informed us that it initiated an investigation into our alleged infringement of European Union competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the European Economic Area. On January 28, 2021, the European Commission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. As previously disclosed, we have cooperated with the investigation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we had accrued (in accordance with U.S. GAAP), on a pre-tax basis, a liability of €\n300\n million ($\n321\n million) within\n other current liabilities\n in the consolidated balance sheet and \nselling, general and administrative expenses\n in the consolidated statement of earnings as an estimate of the possible cost to resolve this matter. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we adjusted our accrual to a liability of €\n340\n million ($\n375\n million). In the second quarter of 2024, we reached a negotiated resolution in this matter and adjusted our accrual from a liability of €\n340\n million to €\n337.5\n million ($\n376\n million), on a pre-tax basis. Pursuant to the terms of the agreed settlement, we fulfilled our payment obligation in August 2024.  We do not anticipate any modification of our business practices and agreements that would have a material impact on our ongoing business operations within the European Union.\nThird-Party Guarantees\nWe enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.\n109\nTable of Contents\nTax Matters\nWe are a party to various tax matter proceedings incidental to our business. These proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable outcomes could subject us to additional tax liabilities and could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial position.\n110\nTable of Contents\nNote 15.

Excluding these impacts, our effective tax rate was \n24.0\n%, which reflects unfavorable foreign provisions under U.S. tax laws as well as net unfavorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income and applicable tax rates in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The \n24.0\n% included a $\n150\n million net tax expense related to pre-tax gains and losses on KDP marketable securities. It also included a favorable discrete net tax benefit of $\n40\n million, driven primarily by a $\n51\n million net benefit from the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to expirations of statutes of limitations and audit settlements in several jurisdictions and a $\n24\n million benefit for the expected tax deduction on the European Commission legal matter, partially offset by a $\n63\n million expense from updating our Swiss tax reform position in Switzerland as it relates to the 2024 tax year.\nOur 2022 effective tax rate of \n26.8\n% was higher than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate due to the buyout of the Clif Bar ESOP that was recorded to earnings before income taxes and the European Commission legal matter, for which there is \nno\n associated income tax benefits. Excluding these impacts, our effective tax rate was \n22.6\n%, which reflects unfavorable provisions from the U.S. tax laws and the establishment of a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset arising from the 2022 Ukraine loss, largely offset by net favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income and applicable tax rates in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The \n22.6\n% includes a favorable discrete net tax benefit of $\n96\n million, driven by a $\n72\n million net benefit from the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to expirations of statutes of limitations and audit settlements in several jurisdictions and a $\n51\n million net benefit from the Chipita acquisition, partially offset by $\n17\n million expense from tax law changes in various jurisdictions.\n113\nTable of Contents\nTax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of:\n \nAs of December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(in millions)\nDeferred income tax assets:\nAccrued postretirement and postemployment benefits\n$\n50\n \n$\n45\n \nOther employee benefits\n154\n \n155\n \nAccrued expenses\n647\n \n632\n \nLoss carryforwards\n681\n \n701\n \nTax credit carryforwards\n736\n \n803\n \nOther\n527\n \n589\n \nTotal deferred income tax assets\n2,795\n \n2,925\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n1,291\n)\n(\n1,359\n)\nNet deferred income tax assets\n$\n1,504\n \n$\n1,566\n \nDeferred income tax liabilities:\nIntangible assets\n$\n(\n3,083\n)\n$\n(\n3,094\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment\n(\n777\n)\n(\n770\n)\nAccrued pension costs\n(\n74\n)\n(\n62\n)\nOther\n(\n662\n)\n(\n524\n)\nTotal deferred income tax liabilities\n(\n4,596\n)\n(\n4,450\n)\nNet deferred income tax liabilities\n$\n(\n3,092\n)\n$\n(\n2,884\n)\nOur significant valuation allowances are in the U.S. and Switzerland. The U.S. valuation allowance relates to excess foreign tax credits generated by the deemed repatriation under U.S. tax reform while the Swiss valuation allowance reduces the amortizable intangible assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Our total valuation allowance was $\n1,359\n million as of January 1, 2024 and $\n1,291\n million as of December 31, 2024. The $(\n68\n) million net change, which includes currency impacts, consisted of $\n65\n million additions less $\n133\n million reductions.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company has tax-effected loss carryforwards of $\n681\n million, of which $\n32\n million will expire at various dates between 2025 and 2044 and the remaining $\n649\n million can be carried forward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the company is indefinitely reinvested in unremitted earnings of approximately $\n4.5\n billion, of which approximately $\n1.4\n billion has already been subject to U.S. tax but would incur approximately $\n99\n million of local costs if repatriated, which has not been recognized in our financial statements. It is not practicable to quantify the total U.S. tax impact from all our indefinitely reinvested earnings. Future tax law changes or changes in the needs of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could require us to recognize deferred tax liabilities on a portion, or all, of our accumulated earnings that are currently indefinitely reinvested.\n114\nTable of Contents\nThe changes in our unrecognized tax benefits were:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions)\nJanuary 1\n$\n442\n \n$\n424\n \n$\n446\n \nIncreases from positions taken during prior periods\n25\n \n33\n \n16\n \nDecreases from positions taken during prior periods\n(\n7\n)\n(\n35\n)\n(\n9\n)\nIncreases from positions taken during the current period\n40\n \n55\n \n48\n \nDecreases relating to settlements with taxing authorities\n(\n20\n)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n54\n)\nReductions resulting from the lapse of the applicable\n   statute of limitations\n(\n20\n)\n(\n29\n)\n(\n22\n)\nCurrency/other\n(\n24\n)\n5\n \n(\n1\n)\nDecember 31\n$\n436\n \n$\n442\n \n$\n424\n \nAs of January 1, 2024, our unrecognized tax benefits were $\n442\n million.

Within the next 12 months, our unrecognized tax benefits could increase by approximately $\n25\n million or decrease by approximately $\n65\n million due to audit developments and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. We include accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. We had accrued interest and penalties of $\n173\n million as of January 1, 2024 and $\n190\n million as of December 31, 2024. Our 2024 provision for income taxes included $\n26\n million expense for interest and penalties.\nIn connection with the 2017 enacted U.S. tax reform, we recorded a $\n1.3\n billion transition tax liability that is payable in installments through 2026. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining liability was approximately $\n360\n million.\nOur income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities. U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three to five years; however, these statutes are often extended by mutual agreement with the tax authorities. The earliest year still open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities is 2016 and years still open to examination by non-U.S. tax authorities in major jurisdictions include (earliest open tax year in parentheses): India (2005), Switzerland (2019), China (2014), United Kingdom (2015), and Greece (2018).\n115\nTable of Contents\nNote 17.

Segment Reporting \nWe manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, as well as gum & candy, cheese & grocery and powdered beverages. \nWe manage our global business and report operating results through geographic units. We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.\nOur operations and management structure are organized into \nfour\n operating segments:\n•\nLatin America\n•\nAMEA\n•\nEurope\n•\nNorth America\nOur Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM uses segment operating income in the annual plan and forecasting process and considers actual versus plan variances in assessing the performance of the segment. The CODM also uses segment operating income as an input to the overall compensation measures for segment management under our incentive compensation plans. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net. We do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that our CODM reviews. Additionally, assets for reportable segments are not disclosed as such information is not regularly reviewed by the Company's CODM.\n \n116\nTable of Contents\nOur segment net revenue, significant segment expenses and operating income, by reportable segment were as follows:\n \nFor The Year Ended December 31, 2024\n \n(in millions)\nLatin America\nAMEA\nEurope\nNorth America\nTotal\nNet revenues\n$\n4,926\n \n$\n7,296\n \n$\n13,309\n \n$\n10,910\n \n$\n36,441\n \nSegment cost of sales\n(\n3,230\n)\n(\n4,382\n)\n(\n8,631\n)\n(\n6,491\n)\n(\n22,734\n)\nSegment selling, general and administrative expenses \n(1)\n(\n1,164\n)\n(\n1,722\n)\n(\n2,610\n)\n(\n1,927\n)\n(\n7,423\n)\nSegment operating income\n$\n532\n \n$\n1,192\n \n$\n2,068\n \n$\n2,492\n \n6,284\n \nUnrealized gains on hedging activities\n(mark-to-market impacts)\n543\n \nGeneral corporate expenses\n(\n330\n)\nAmortization of intangible assets\n(\n153\n)\nNet gain on divestitures and acquisitions\n4\n \nAcquisition-related costs\n(\n3\n)\nOperating income\n$\n6,345\n \n \nFor The Year Ended December 31, 2023\n \n(in millions)\nLatin America\nAMEA\nEurope\nNorth America\nTotal\nNet revenues\n$\n5,006\n \n$\n7,075\n \n$\n12,857\n \n$\n11,078\n \n$\n36,016\n \nSegment cost of sales\n(\n3,284\n)\n(\n4,320\n)\n(\n8,359\n)\n(\n6,474\n)\n(\n22,437\n)\nSegment selling, general and administrative expenses \n(1)\n(\n1,193\n)\n(\n1,642\n)\n(\n2,520\n)\n(\n2,512\n)\n(\n7,867\n)\nSegment operating income\n$\n529\n \n$\n1,113\n \n$\n1,978\n \n$\n2,092\n \n5,712\n \nUnrealized gains on hedging activities\n(mark-to-market impacts)\n189\n \nGeneral corporate expenses\n(\n356\n)\nAmortization of intangible assets\n(\n151\n)\nNet gain on divestitures and acquisitions\n108\n \nOperating income\n$\n5,502\n \n \nFor The Year Ended December 31, 2022\n \n(in millions)\nLatin America\nAMEA\nEurope\nNorth America\nTotal\nNet revenues\n$\n3,629\n \n$\n6,767\n \n$\n11,420\n \n$\n9,680\n \n$\n31,496\n \nSegment cost of sales\n(\n2,443\n)\n(\n4,180\n)\n(\n7,318\n)\n(\n5,888\n)\n(\n19,829\n)\nSegment selling, general and administrative expenses \n(1)\n(\n798\n)\n(\n1,658\n)\n(\n2,621\n)\n(\n2,023\n)\n(\n7,100\n)\nSegment operating income\n$\n388\n \n$\n929\n \n$\n1,481\n \n$\n1,769\n \n4,567\n \nUnrealized losses on hedging activities\n(mark-to-market impacts)\n(\n326\n)\nGeneral corporate expenses\n(\n245\n)\nAmortization of intangible assets\n(\n132\n)\nAcquisition-related costs\n(\n330\n)\nOperating income\n$\n3,534\n \n(1) SG&A for all reportable segments includes: Advertising & consumer expenses and overhead expenses.\n117\nTable of Contents\nTotal depreciation expense and capital expenditures by segment, reflecting our current segment structure for all periods presented, were:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions)\nDepreciation expense \n(2)\n:\nLatin America\n$\n151\n \n$\n152\n \n$\n111\n \nAMEA\n162\n \n155\n \n160\n \nEurope\n275\n \n241\n \n242\n \nNorth America\n177\n \n152\n \n140\n \n  Corporate\n45\n \n41\n \n37\n \nTotal depreciation expense\n$\n810\n \n$\n741\n \n$\n690\n \n(2)\nIncludes depreciation expense related to owned property, plant and equipment.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nltem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in \nInternal Control Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). The scope of Management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting excludes Evirth as it was acquired in 2024. The total assets and total net revenues of Evirth represent 0.37% and 0.19% of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nBased on this assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2024, based on the criteria in \nInternal Control Integrated Framework\n issued by the COSO.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report that appears under Item 8.\nFebruary 5, 2025 \n120\nTable of Contents\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.
