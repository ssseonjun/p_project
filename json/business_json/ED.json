Net income for common stock for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes $(46) million (after-tax) for adjustments related to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X to the financial statements in Item 8.\nInflation Reduction Act\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law and implemented a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) that imposes a 15 percent tax on modified GAAP net income. Under the IRA, a corporation is subject to the CAMT if its average annual adjusted financial statement income for the three taxable year period ending prior to the taxable year exceeds $1,000 million, and applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. \nPursuant to the IRA, corporations are entitled to a tax credit (minimum tax credit) to the extent the CAMT liability exceeds the regular tax liability. This amount can be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years when regular tax exceeds the CAMT.\nBeginning in 2024, based on the existing statue, the Companies are subject to and report the CAMT in their Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companies accrued a CAMT liability of $139 million, $111 million of which is for CECONY, before the application of general business credits with an offsetting deferred tax asset representing the minimum tax credit carryforward, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Companies are continuing to assess the impacts of the IRA on their financial statements and will update estimates based on future guidance to be issued by the Department of the Treasury.\nNew York Legislation\nIn April 2021, New York passed a law that increased the corporate franchise tax rate on business income from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent, retroactive to January 1, 2021, for taxpayers with taxable income greater than $5 million. The law also reinstated the business capital tax at 0.1875 percent, not to exceed a maximum tax liability of $5 million per taxpayer. New York requires a corporate franchise taxpayer to calculate and pay the highest amount of tax under the three alternative methods: a tax on business income; a tax on business capital; or a fixed dollar minimum. The provisions to increase the corporate franchise tax rate and reinstate a capital tax were scheduled to expire after 2023. In May 2023, New York passed a law that extended the increase in the corporate franchise tax rate from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent for an additional three years, through tax year 2026 and extended the business capital tax through tax year 2026.  New York also passed a law establishing a permanent rate of 30 percent for the metropolitan transportation business tax surcharge. As a result of the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses in 2023, Con Edison's New York State taxable income was higher than $5 million and subject to the higher 7.25 percent rate (9.425 percent with the surcharge rate) on its taxable income for tax year 2023, but is not subject to the higher rate in tax year 2024.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n57\n                      \nResults of Operations\nNet income for common stock and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars,\nexcept per share amounts)\nNet Income for\nCommon Stock\nEarnings per Share\n  \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCECONY\n$1,748\n$1,606\n$5.05 \n$4.62 \nO&R\n104\n96\n0.30 \n0.28 \nClean Energy Businesses (a)\n—\n22\n— \n0.07 \nCon Edison Transmission (b)\n45\n37\n0.13 \n0.11 \nOther (c)\n(77)\n758\n(0.22)\n2.17 \nCon Edison (d)\n$1,820\n$2,519\n$5.26\n \n$7.25\n \n(a)\nNet income for common stock and earnings per share from the Clean Energy Businesses for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects\n $2 million or $0.01 a share (after-tax) of the effects of HLBV accounting for tax equity investments in certain renewable electric projects.

Effective November 1, 2023, revenues from CECONY’s steam sales are also subject to a weather normalization clause, as a result of which, delivery revenues reflect normal weather conditions during the heating season. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying \nenergy to their full-service customers. Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect Con Edison’s results of operations.\nb.    On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses and therefore 2023 reflects the financial results for the two months ended February 2023.\nc.

CECONY has a $500 million 364-day revolving credit agreement (the CECONY Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2025, subject to certain conditions. Con Edison and the Utilities have not entered into any loans under the Credit Agreement and CECONY has not entered into any loans under the CECONY Credit Agreement.\nIn November 2024 and January 2025, CECONY borrowed $500 million and $200 million, respectively, at a variable\nrate under a 364-Day Senior Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement entered into by the company in November 2024 (the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement). The term loans mature in November 2025.\nCECONY has the option to prepay the term loans issued under the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement prior to\nmaturity. \nFERC has authorized CECONY through April 30, 2026 and O&R through July 31, 2026 to issue short-term borrowings for a period of not more than 12 months, in an amount not to exceed $4,000 million and $250 million, respectively, at prevailing market rates.\nThe Companies’ liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below.\nThe principal factors affecting Con Edison’s liquidity are its investments in the Utilities and Con Edison Transmission, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.\nThe principal factors affecting CECONY’s liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including capital expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.\nThe Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement of the Company assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n (2013). Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company had effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. \nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \n \n/s/ Timothy P. Cawley\nTimothy P. Cawley\n \nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n \n/s/ Kirkland B. Andrews\nKirkland B. Andrews\n \nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 20, 2025 \n \n84\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Consolidated Edison, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and financial statement schedule, of Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as listed in the index appearing under Item 8 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n85\n                      \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Regulatory Matters\nAs described in Notes A and B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company applies the accounting rules for regulated operations, which specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. As of December 31, 2024, there were $5,664 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets and $5,546 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reductions. Under regulatory accounting rules, if it is probable that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, those costs would be recorded as deferred charges or “regulatory assets.” Similarly, if revenues are recorded for costs expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or “regulatory liabilities.” The Company’s regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state regulators. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the recoverability of certain regulatory assets and the significant auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the recognition of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, including evaluating management’s judgments relating to the recoverability of certain regulatory assets. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s assessment of regulatory proceedings and the implementation of new regulatory orders or changes to existing regulatory balances. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment of impacts arising from correspondence with regulators and changes in laws and regulations; evaluating management’s judgments related to the recoverability of regulatory assets and the establishment of regulatory liabilities; and recalculating regulatory assets and liabilities based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with regulators.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n \nNew York, New York\n \nFebruary 20, 2025 \nWe have served as the

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement of the Company assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework\n (2013). Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company had effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \n/s/ Timothy P. Cawley\nTimothy P. Cawley\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\n/s/ Kirkland B. Andrews\nKirkland B. Andrews\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 20, 2025 \n \n96\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Board of Trustees and Shareholder of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as listed in the index appearing under Item 8 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n97\n                      \nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Regulatory Matters\nAs described in Notes A and B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company applies the accounting rules for regulated operations, which specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. As of December 31, 2024, there were $5,264 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets and $4,980 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reductions. Under regulatory accounting rules, if it is probable that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, those costs would be recorded as deferred charges or “regulatory assets.” Similarly, if revenues are recorded for costs expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or “regulatory liabilities.” The Company’s regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state regulators. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the recoverability of certain regulatory assets and the significant auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the recognition of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, including evaluating management’s judgments relating to the recoverability of certain regulatory assets. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s assessment of regulatory proceedings and the implementation of new regulatory orders or changes to existing regulatory balances. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment of impacts arising from correspondence with regulators and changes in laws and regulations; evaluating management’s judgments related to the recoverability of regulatory assets and the establishment of regulatory liabilities; and recalculating regulatory assets and liabilities based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with regulators.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York \nFebruary 20, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s

of each of the \ntwo\n separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries (CECONY). CECONY is a subsidiary of Con Edison and as such its financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, that are presented separately in the CECONY consolidated financial statements, are also consolidated, along with those of Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), Con Edison Transmission, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Con Edison Transmission) and its former subsidiary, Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Clean Energy Businesses), in Con Edison’s consolidated financial statements. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X. The term “Utilities” is used in these notes to refer to CECONY and O&R.\nAs used in these notes, the term “Companies” refers to Con Edison and CECONY and, except as otherwise noted, the information in these combined notes relates to each of the Companies. However, CECONY makes no representation as to information relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself. Con Edison has \ntwo\n regulated utility subsidiaries: CECONY and O&R. CECONY provides electric service and gas service in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiary, provides electric service in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey and gas service in southeastern New York. Con Edison Transmission, through its subsidiaries, invests in electric transmission projects and manages, through joint ventures, both electric and gas assets while seeking to develop electric transmission projects. See \"Investments\" in Note A and Note W.\n \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n107\n                      \nNote A – \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Matters\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Companies’ consolidated financial statements include the accounts of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (see Note S), as required. All intercompany balances and intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nAccounting Policies\nThe accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). For the Utilities, these accounting principles include the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the state regulators having jurisdiction.\nThe accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or “regulatory assets” under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or “regulatory liabilities” under the accounting rules for regulated operations.\nThe Utilities’ principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in Note B. In general, the Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made, and are paying or being charged with a return on their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities’ regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2024 are recoverable from customers, or to be applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions that have been approved by state regulators.\nOther significant accounting policies of the Companies are referenced below in this Note A and in the notes that follow.\nRevenues\nCECONY’s electric and gas rate plans and O&R’s New York electric and gas rate plans each contain a revenue decoupling mechanism, that covers all residential and most commercial customers, under which the company’s actual energy delivery revenues are compared with the authorized delivery revenues and the difference accrued, with interest, for refund to, or recovery from, customers, as applicable. See “Rate Plans” in Note B.\nThe NYSPSC requires utilities to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis (i.e., included in both revenue and expense). The recovery of these taxes is generally provided for in the revenue requirement within each of the respective NYSPSC-approved rate plans.\n \nTotal excise taxes (inclusive of gross receipts taxes) recorded in operating revenues were as follows:\n  \n            For the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCon Edison\n$\n437\n$\n409\n$\n400\nCECONY\n425\n396\n387\nFor information about the Companies' revenue recognition policies, see Note M.\nPlant and Depreciation\nUtility Plant\nUtility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). The original cost of property is charged to expense over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement, the original cost of property is charged to accumulated depreciation. See Note T.\nRates used for AFUDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate of return on the Utilities’ own funds when so used, determined in accordance with regulations of the FERC or the state public utility regulatory authority \n108\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nhaving jurisdiction. The rate is compounded semiannually, and the amounts applicable to borrowed funds are treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the Utilities’ own funds are credited to other income (deductions). The AFUDC rates for CECONY were \n5.9\n percent, \n5.9\n percent and \n5.2\n percent for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The AFUDC rates for O&R were \n6.0\n percent, \n6.2\n percent and \n5.0\n percent for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Utilities generally compute annual charges for depreciation using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, with rates based on average service lives and net salvage factors. The average depreciation rates for CECONY were \n3.6\n percent for 2024, \n3.6\n percent\n for \n2023 and \n3.5\n percent for 2022. The average depreciation rates for O&R were \n3.3\n percent for 2024, \n3.1\n percent\n for \n2023 and \n3.0\n percent for 2022.\nThe estimated lives for utility plant for CECONY range from \n5\n to \n80\n years for electric, \n5\n to \n80\n years for gas, \n5\n to \n55\n years for steam and \n5\n to \n50\n years for general plant. For O&R, the estimated lives for utility plant range from \n5\n to \n75\n years for electric and gas and \n5\n to \n50\n years for general plant.\nThe capitalized cost of the Companies' utility plant (net of accumulated depreciation) on \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, was as follows:\n  \n                 Con Edison\n                CECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nElectric\nGeneration\n$\n577\n$\n580\n$\n577\n$\n580\nTransmission\n5,072\n4,652\n4,703\n4,333\nDistribution\n25,129\n24,491\n23,770\n23,238\nGeneral\n174\n141\n174\n141\n \nGas (a)\n12,703\n12,023\n11,830\n11,226\nSteam\n2,006\n1,990\n2,006\n1,990\nGeneral\n3,249\n3,158\n2,940\n2,860\nHeld for future use\n77\n118\n69\n110\nConstruction work in progress\n3,165\n2,442\n2,912\n2,168\nNet Utility Plant\n$\n52,152\n$\n49,594\n$\n48,981\n$\n46,646\n(a)    Primarily distribution.\nGeneral utility plant of Con Edison and CECONY included $\n59\n million and $\n56\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024, and $\n65\n million and $\n62\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2023, related to a May 2018 acquisition of software licenses. The estimated aggregate annual amortization expense related to the software licenses for Con Edison and CECONY is $\n7\n million. The accumulated amortization for Con Edison and CECONY was $\n45\n million and $\n43\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and $\n38\n million and $\n36\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\nUnder the Utilities’ rate plans, the aggregate annual depreciation allowance for the period ended December 31, 2024 was $\n2,228\n million, including $\n2,109\n million under CECONY’s electric, gas and steam rate plans that have been approved by the NYSPSC. \nNon–Utility Plant\nNon-utility plant is stated at original cost. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and X. For Con Edison, non-utility plant consisted primarily of the Clean Energy Businesses’ renewable electric projects. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and include capitalized interest during construction. Depreciation is computed under the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets. Solar power generating assets and wind power generating assets have useful lives of \n35\n years and \n30\n years, respectively. \nFor the Utilities, non-utility plant consists of land and conduit for telecommunication use. Depreciation on non-utility plant, other than land, is computed using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes over their estimated useful lives, which is \n10\n years.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n109\n                      \nOther Deferred Charges and Noncurrent Assets and Prepayments \nOther deferred charges and noncurrent assets and prepayments, net of accumulated depreciation, \nincluded the following related to implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements:\nCon Edison\nCECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nPrepayments (a)(b)\n$\n57\n$\n50\n$\n54\n$\n49\nOther Deferred Charges and Noncurrent Assets (a)(b)\n254\n179\n243\n178\n(a)    Amortization on these assets is computed using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes over their estimated useful lives.\n(b)    Amortization expense related to these assets incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 for Con Edison and CECONY was $\n33\n million and $\n32\n million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023 for Con Edison and CECONY was $\n21\n million and $\n20\n million, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for Con Edison and CECONY was $\n15\n million and $\n14\n million, respectively. Accumulated amortization related to these assets for Con Edison and CECONY was $\n91\n million and $\n85\n million, respectively at December 31, 2024 and was $\n58\n million and $\n53\n million, respectively at December 31, 2023.\nLong–Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Companies test long-lived and intangible assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or intangible asset with a definite life is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. In the event a test indicates that such cash flows cannot be expected to be sufficient to fully recover the assets, the assets are considered impaired and written down to their estimated fair value.\nPrior to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses on March 1, 2023, Con Edison's intangible assets with definite lives consisted primarily of power purchase agreements. See Note W and Note X. Con Edison's and CECONY's intangible assets were \nimmaterial\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Con Edison recorded amortization expense related to its intangible assets of $\n71\n million in 2022. Con Edison expects amortization expense to be \nimmaterial\n over each of the next five years, and recorded \nimmaterial\n amounts in 2023 and 2024. \nNo\n impairment charges were recorded on Con Edison's long-lived assets or intangible assets with definite lives in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nRecoverable Energy Costs\nThe Utilities generally recover all of their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility regulators. If the actual energy supply costs for a given month are more or less than the amounts billed to customers for that month, the difference in most cases is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed electric and steam supply costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers during the next billing cycle (normally within \none\n or \ntwo months\n). For the Utilities’ gas costs, differences between actual and billed gas costs during the 12-month period ending each August are charged or refunded to customers during a subsequent 12-month period.\nNew York Independent System Operator (NYISO)\nThe Utilities purchase electricity through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. The difference between purchased power and related costs initially billed to the Utilities by the NYISO and the actual cost of power subsequently calculated by the NYISO is refunded by the NYISO to the Utilities, or paid to the NYISO by the Utilities. The reconciliation payments or receipts are recoverable from or refundable to the Utilities’ customers.\nCertain other payments to or receipts from the NYISO are also subject to reconciliation, with shortfalls or amounts in excess of specified rate allowances recoverable from or refundable to customers. These include proceeds from the sale through the NYISO of transmission rights on CECONY’s transmission system (transmission congestion contracts or TCCs).\nTemporary Cash Investments\nTemporary cash investments are short-term, highly-liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. They are stated at cost, which approximates market. The Companies consider temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.\n110\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nInvestments\nAccounting for Investments\nCon Edison’s investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method and the fair value of the Utilities’ supplemental retirement income plan and deferred income plan assets.\nThe accounting rules require Con Edison to evaluate its investments periodically to determine whether they are impaired. The standard for determining whether an impairment exists and must be recorded is whether an other-than-temporary decline in carrying value has occurred. Changes in economic conditions, forecasted cash flows and the regulatory environment, among other factors, could require equity method investments to recognize a decrease in carrying value for an other-than-temporary decline. When management believes such a decline may have occurred, the fair value of the investment is estimated using market inputs, when observable, or a valuation model such as a discounted cash flow analysis. The fair value is compared to the carrying value of the investment in order to determine the amount of impairment to record, if any.\nThe evaluation and measurement of impairments involve uncertainties. The judgments that Con Edison makes to estimate the fair value of its equity method investments are based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable, and variations in these estimates or the underlying assumptions, or the receipt of additional market information, could have a material impact on whether a triggering event is determined to exist or the amount of any such impairment. Additionally, if the projects in which Con Edison holds these investments recognize an impairment, Con Edison may record a share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in carrying value as described above. \nCon Edison Transmission is considering strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in MVP and both Con Edison Transmission and CECONY are considering strategic alternatives with respect to their investments in Honeoye. \nInvestment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP)  \nIn January 2016, a subsidiary of Con Edison Transmission, acquired a \n12.5\n percent interest in MVP, a company developing a proposed \n300\n-mile gas transmission project (the Mountain Valley Pipeline) in West Virginia and Virginia. During 2019, Con Edison exercised its right to limit, and did limit, its cash contributions to the joint venture to approximately $\n530\n million. In June 2024, the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a \n303\n-mile gas transmission pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia, entered service. The project operator is continuing restoration of the right of way and estimates a total project cost of approximately $\n8,100\n million (excluding allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC)). At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of Con Edison Transmission's investment in MVP was $\n166\n million, and its cash contributions to the joint venture amounted to $\n530\n million. Con Edison records its pro rata share of earnings from its equity investment in MVP, adjusted for accretion of the basis difference and income taxes, on its consolidated income statement. Con Edison's pro rata share of earnings from its equity investment in MVP, adjusted for accretion of the basis difference, was $\n29\n million ($\n21\n million after-tax) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Con Edison Transmission's interest in MVP, the company that developed the project, is \n6.7\n percent and is expected to be reduced to approximately \n6.6\n percent upon completion of the restoration of the right of way and based on Con Edison Transmission's previous capping of its cash contributions. There were no impairments to the carrying value of Con Edison Transmission's investment in MVP for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n \nSummary of Investment Balances\nThe following investment assets are included in the Companies' consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n111\n                      \nCon Edison\nCECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nSupplemental retirement income plan assets (b)\n$\n583\n$\n524\n$\n560\n$\n502\nCon Edison Transmission's investment in New York Transco (d)\n254\n221\n—\n—\n \nCon Edison Transmission's investment in MVP (a) (d)\n166\n144\n—\n—\nDeferred income plan assets\n116\n99\n116\n99\nVirginia Tax Equity Projects (c)\n4\n8\n—\n—\n \nOther\n3\n3\n8\n7\nTotal investments\n$\n1,126\n$\n999\n$\n684\n$\n608\n \n(a)\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Con Edison Transmission's cash investment in MVP was\n $\n530\n million. In June 2024, MVP entered service at an overall project cost of approximately $\n8,100\n million excluding allowance for funds used during construction.  See \"Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP)\" above. \n(b)\nSee Note E.\n(c)\nSee Note S.\n(d)\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Con Edison had undistributed earnings from MVP of $\n127\n million and $\n114\n million, respectively, and undistributed earnings from New York Transco of $\n16\n million and $\n13\n million, respectively.\n \nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe accounting rules for retirement benefits require an employer to recognize an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. For a pension plan, the asset or liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation. For any other postretirement benefit plan, the asset or liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The accounting rules generally require employers to recognize all unrecognized prior service costs and credits and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (OCI), net of tax. Such amounts will be adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of total periodic benefit cost or income pursuant to the current recognition and amortization provisions.\nFor the Utilities’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. Unrecognized prior service costs or credits and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recorded to regulatory assets or liabilities, rather than OCI. See Notes E and F.\nThe total periodic benefit costs are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. Investment gains and losses are recognized in expense over a \n15\n-year period and other actuarial gains and losses are recognized in expense over a \n10\n-year period, subject to the deferral provisions in the rate plans.\nIn accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between such expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. O&R also defers such difference pursuant to its NY rate plans. See Note B.\nThe Companies calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year. The accounting rules allow the MRV of plan assets to be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. The Companies use a calculated value when determining the MRV of the plan assets that adjusts for \n20\n percent of the difference between fair value and expected MRV of plan assets. This calculated value has the effect of stabilizing variability in assets to which the Companies apply the expected return.\n112\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nFederal Income Tax\nIn accordance with accounting rules for income taxes, the Companies have recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability at current tax rates for temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. In accordance with rate plans, the Utilities have recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or “turn-around” of these temporary differences. As to the remaining deferred tax liability, the Utilities had established regulatory assets for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related future tax expense pursuant to the NYSPSC's 1993 Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with accounting rules for income taxes and providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates. \nAccumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction to future federal income tax expense.\nCon Edison and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate return method. Each member pays or receives an amount based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with a consolidated tax allocation agreement. Tax loss and tax credit carryforwards are allocated among members in accordance with consolidated tax return regulations.\nState Income Tax\nCon Edison and its subsidiaries file a combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the company does business. Each member’s share of the New York State tax is based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.\nReclassification \nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. These reclassifications include short-term debt activity within the financing section of the Con Edison Statement of Cash Flows.\n \nEarnings Per Share\nCon Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of its consolidated income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareholders (“Net income for common stock” on Con Edison’s consolidated income statement) by the weighted average number of Con Edison common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock.\nPotentially dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock units and deferred stock units for which the average market price of the common shares for the period was greater than the estimated vesting price (see Note O) and its common shares that are subject to forward sale agreement (see Note C). Before the issuance of common shares upon settlement of the forward sale agreement, the shares will be reflected in the company’s diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of common shares used in calculating diluted earnings per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreement over the number of shares that could be purchased by the company in the market (based on the average market price during the period) using the proceeds due upon physical settlement (based on the adjusted forward sale price at the end of the reporting period).\n \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n113\n                      \nBasic and diluted EPS for Con Edison are calculated as follows:\n               For the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts/Shares in Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income for common stock\n$\n1,820\n$\n2,519\n$\n1,660\nWeighted average common shares outstanding – basic\n346.0\n347.7\n354.5\nAdd: Incremental shares attributable to effect of potentially dilutive securities\n1.3\n1.6\n1.3\nAdjusted weighted average common shares outstanding – diluted\n347.3\n349.3\n355.8\nNet Income per common share – basic\n$\n5.26\n$\n7.25\n$\n4.68\nNet Income per common share – diluted\n$\n5.24\n$\n7.21\n$\n4.66\nThe computation of diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2024 excludes immaterial amounts of performance share awards that were not included because of their anti-dilutive effect.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nReconciliation of Cash, Temporary Cash Investments and Restricted Cash\nCash, temporary cash investments and restricted cash are presented on a combined basis in the Companies’ consolidated statements of cash flows. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash, temporary cash investments and restricted cash for Con Edison were as follows; CECONY did not have material restricted cash balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nAt December 31,\nCon Edison\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\nCash and temporary cash investments\n$\n1,324\n$\n1,189\nRestricted cash (a)\n9\n6\nTotal cash, temporary cash investments and restricted cash\n$\n1,333\n$\n1,195\n(a)\nOn March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W. Con Edison retained one deferred project, Broken Bow II, a \n75\n MW nameplate capacity wind power project located in Nebraska. Con Edison's restricted cash for the 2023 and 2024 periods primarily include restricted cash of Broken Bow II, which was held for sale as of December 31, 2024. Broken Bow II was sold and transferred in January 2025. See Note W and Note X.\n \nVariable Interest Entities\nThe accounting rules for consolidation address the consolidation of a variable interest entity (VIE) by a business enterprise that is the primary beneficiary. A VIE is an entity that does not have a sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the business enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and either absorbs a significant amount of the VIE’s losses or has the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE.\nThe Companies enter into arrangements including leases, partnerships and electricity purchase agreements, with various entities. As a result of these arrangements, the Companies retain or may retain a variable interest in these entities.\nUse of Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value\nFor certain investments of the Clean Energy Businesses and of Con Edison, Con Edison has determined that the use of HLBV accounting is reasonable and appropriate to attribute income and loss to the tax equity investors. Using the HLBV method, the company's earnings from the projects are adjusted to reflect the income or loss allocable to the tax equity investors calculated based on how the project would allocate and distribute its cash if it were to sell all of its assets for their carrying amounts and liquidate at a particular point in time. Under the HLBV \n114\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nmethod, the company calculates the liquidation value allocable to the tax equity investors at the beginning and end of each period based on the contractual liquidation waterfall and adjusts its income for the period to reflect the change in the liquidation value allocable to the tax equity investors based on the terms of the partnerships' operating agreements. See Note S. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W.\nAssets Held for Sale\nGenerally, a long-lived asset or business to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, commits to a plan to sell, and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. Con Edison records assets and liabilities, once held for sale, at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell, and also stops recording depreciation and amortization on assets held for sale.\nOn March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses (which was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022) with the exception of \ntwo\n tax equity interests and \none\n deferred project, Broken Bow II. \nIn January 2025, Con Edison completed the sale and transfer of Broken Bow II to RWE. For further information, see Note W and Note X.\nThe sale of the Clean Energy Businesses did not represent a strategic shift that had or would have had a major effect on Con Edison, and as such, the sale did not qualify for treatment as a discontinued operation. \nFor further information, see Note W and Note X.\nNote B – \nRegulatory Matters\nRate Plans\nThe Utilities provide service to New York customers according to the terms of tariffs approved by the NYSPSC. Tariffs for service to customers of Rockland Electric Company (RECO), O&R’s New Jersey regulated utility subsidiary, are approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU). The tariffs include schedules of rates for service that limit the rates charged by the Utilities to amounts that the Utilities recover from their customers costs approved by the regulator, including capital costs, of providing service to customers as defined by the tariff. The tariffs implement rate plans adopted by state utility regulators in rate orders issued at the conclusion of rate proceedings. Pursuant to the Utilities’ rate plans, there generally can be no change to the charges to customers during the respective terms of the rate plans other than specified adjustments provided for in the rate plans. The Utilities’ rate plans each cover specified periods, but rates determined pursuant to a plan generally continue in effect until a new rate plan is approved by the state utility regulator.\nCommon provisions of the Utilities’ New York rate plans include:\nBase Rates \nare designed to recover core costs of providing electric, gas or steam delivery service such as the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining a service’s system.\nEarnings sharing\n that require the Utilities to defer for customer benefit a portion of earnings over specified rates of return on common equity. There is no symmetric mechanism for earnings below specified rates of return on common equity.\nNegative revenue adjustments\n for failure to meet certain performance standards relating to service, reliability, safety and other matters.\nNet utility plant reconciliations\n that require deferral as a regulatory liability of the revenue requirement impact of the amount, if any, by which actual average net utility plant balances are less than amounts reflected in rates. There is generally no symmetric mechanism if actual average net utility plant balances are more than amounts reflected in rates.\nOther revenue adjustments\n that represent positive revenue adjustments, positive incentives, and earnings adjustments mechanisms for achievement of performance standards related to achievement of clean energy goals, safety and other matters.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n115\n                      \nRate base\n, as reflected in the rate plans, is, in general, the sum of the Utilities’ net plant, working capital and certain regulatory assets less deferred taxes and certain regulatory liabilities. For each rate plan, the NYSPSC uses a forecast of the average rate base for each year that new rates would be in effect (“rate year”).\nRecoverable energy costs\n that allow the Utilities to recover on a current basis the costs for the energy they supply with no mark-up to their full-service customers.\nRegulatory reconciliations\n that reconcile pension and other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation costs, property taxes, variable-rate tax-exempt debt and certain other costs (including late payment charges and write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances) to amounts reflected in delivery rates for such costs. In addition, changes in the Utilities' costs not reflected in rates, in excess of certain amounts, resulting from changes in tax or changes in legislation, regulation or related actions, are deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability to be reflected in the Utilities' next rate plan or in a manner to be determined by the NYSPSC. Also, the Utilities generally retain the right to petition for recovery or accounting deferral of extraordinary and material cost increases and provision is sometimes made for the utility to retain a share of cost reductions, for example, property tax refunds. \nRevenue decoupling mechanisms\n that reconcile actual energy delivery revenues to the authorized delivery revenues approved by the NYSPSC. The difference is accrued with interest for refund to, or recovery from customers, as applicable.\nWeighted average cost of capital\n is determined based on the authorized common equity ratio, return on common equity, cost of long-term debt and cost of customer deposits reflected in each rate plan. For each rate plan, the revenues designed to provide the utility a return on invested capital for each rate year are determined by multiplying each utility rate base by its pre\n–\ntax weighted average cost of capital. The Utilities’ actual return on common equity will reflect their actual operations for each rate year, and may be more or less than the authorized return on equity reflected in their rate plans (and if more, may be subject to earnings sharing). \n116\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nThe following tables contain a summary of the Utilities’ rate plans:\nCECONY – Electric\n  \n \nEffective period\nJanuary 2020 – December 2022\n  \nJanuary 2023 – December 2025\nBase rate changes \nYr. 1 – $\n113\n million (a) \nYr. 2 – $\n370\n million (a)\nYr. 3 – $\n326\n million (a)\n  \nYr. 1 – $\n442\n million (c) \nYr. 2 – $\n518\n million (c)\nYr. 3 – $\n382\n million (c)\nAmortizations to income of net regulatory (assets) and liabilities\nYr. 1 – $\n267\n million (b) \nYr. 2 – $\n269\n million (b) \nYr. 3 – $\n272\n million (b)\n  \nYr. 1 – $\n104\n million (j)\nYr. 2 – $\n49\n million (j)\nYr. 3 – $(\n205\n) million (j)\nOther revenue sources\nRetention of $\n75\n million of annual transmission congestion revenues.\nPotential earnings adjustment mechanism incentives for energy efficiency and other potential incentives of up to: \nYr. 1 - $\n69\n million \nYr. 2 - $\n74\n million\nYr. 3 - $\n79\n million \nIn 2020, 2021 and 2022, the company recorded $\n34\n million, $\n64\n million and $\n33\n million primarily related to earnings adjustment mechanism incentives for energy efficiency, respectively. \nIn 2022, the company recorded a positive incentive of $\n4\n million.\n  \nRetention of $\n75\n million of annual transmission congestion revenues.\nPotential earnings adjustment mechanism incentives for energy efficiency and other potential incentives of up to: \nYr. 1 - $\n70\n million \nYr. 2 - $\n75\n million\nYr. 3 - $\n79\n million \nIn 2023 and 2024, the company recorded $\n34.4\n million and $\n52.3\n million primarily related to earnings adjustment mechanism incentives for energy efficiency, respectively.\nRevenue decoupling mechanisms\nContinuation of reconciliation of actual to authorized electric delivery revenues.\nIn 2020, 2021 and 2022, the company deferred for recovery from customers $\n242\n million, $\n226\n million and $\n90\n million of revenues, respectively.\n  \nContinuation of reconciliation of actual to authorized electric delivery revenues.\nIn 2023 and 2024, the company deferred for recovery from customers $\n162\n million and $\n164\n million of revenues, respectively.\nRecoverable energy costs \nContinuation of current rate recovery of purchased power and fuel costs.\n  \nContinuation of current rate recovery of purchased power and fuel costs.\nNegative revenue adjustments\nPotential charges if certain performance targets relating to service, reliability, safety and other matters are not met:\nYr. 1 - $\n450\n million \nYr. 2 - $\n461\n million\nYr. 3 - $\n476\n million\nIn 2020, the company recorded negative revenue adjustments of $\n5\n million.

The Brooklyn Clean Energy Hub primarily addresses an identified reliability need in 2028 due to a forecasted increase in electric demand. Construction began in September 2023 and is expected to be completed by 2028. \nCECONY’s January 2025 electric rate case filing reflected the costs for the Brooklyn Clean Energy Hub in base rates. \n118\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nIn January 2024, the NYSPSC approved CECONY's August 2023 petition requesting authorization and cost recovery to construct \ntwo\n new substations in Jamaica, Queens (Idlewild Project) that is in addition to the capital expenditures approved in CECONY's 2023 - 2025 electric rate plan summarized above. The project is expected to be completed by May 2028 to meet anticipated reliability needs and to support New York State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goals. CECONY estimates that construction will cost $\n1,200\n million. CECONY's January 2025 electric rate case filing reflected the costs for the Idlewild Project in base rates.\nIn January 2025, CECONY filed a request with the NYSPSC for an electric rate increase of $\n1,612\n million, effective January 1, 2026. The filing reflects a return on common equity of \n10.1\n percent and a common equity ratio of \n48\n percent. \nThe company is requesting provisions pursuant to which expenses for pension and other post-retirement benefits, long-term debt, storm restoration, property taxes, municipal infrastructure support, the impact of new laws, late payment charges, and environmental site investigation and remediation are reconciled to amounts reflected in rates. In addition, the company is proposing a continued reconciliation and current recovery or surcharge mechanism of uncollectible write-offs to the level in rates. The company is proposing the continuation of earnings opportunities from Earnings Adjustment Mechanisms for meeting energy efficiency goals. The filing also reflects continuation of the revenue decoupling mechanism and the provisions pursuant to which the company recovers its purchased power and fuel costs from customers. \nThe filing includes supplemental information regarding electric rate plans for 2027 and 2028, which the company is not requesting, but would consider through settlement discussions.

The conservation incentive program is not permitted if RECO’s actual return on equity exceeds the approved base rate filing return on equity by 50 basis points or more.  \nIn December 2022, the NJBPU authorized a $\n47.8\n million Infrastructure Investment Program (IIP) over a \nfive-year\n period (2023 – 2027).

The program was established to partially offset the costs all customers pay to fund utility energy affordability programs. \nOther Regulatory Matters\nIn January 2023, CECONY initiated a review of welds on certain gas and steam mains following the company’s discovery of a leak from a gas main weld in Queens, New York. During the course of its review thus far, CECONY discovered a limited number of other non-conforming gas and steam main welds. New York regulations require utilities to perform and record weld films for certain gas and steam main welds. Upon reviewing these films, CECONY determined that in some instances third-party contractors engaged in misconduct by substituting duplicate weld films for different welds, while another third-party contractor had created poor quality weld films. CECONY voluntarily disclosed its initial review and findings to the NYSDPS which, in turn, initiated its own investigation. CECONY also reported the contractors’ misconduct to law enforcement. Given the nature of the non-conforming \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n129\n                      \nwelds identified, CECONY does not anticipate significant impact to the operation of its gas and steam mains. CECONY continues to investigate this matter, is remediating and monitoring the known non-conforming welds and is cooperating with the NYSDPS on its investigation of this matter. CECONY is unable to estimate the amount or range of its possible loss, if any, related to this matter. At December 31, 2024, CECONY had not accrued a liability related to this matter.\nIn May 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order denying an April 2023 petition by CECONY that requested permission to capitalize costs to implement its new customer billing and information system to the extent those costs exceeded the $\n421\n million cap established in CECONY’s 2020 – 2022 electric and gas rate plans. CECONY’s final costs for the new system were $\n510\n million ($\n89\n million above the $\n421\n million cap in the rate plans). CECONY believes that the incremental costs were both prudent and necessary for the successful deployment of the system for the benefit of its customers. In May 2024, CECONY expensed incremental costs of $\n51\n million for the new system that were previously capitalized, in addition to a $\n38\n million reserve established at December 31, 2023. In June 2024, CECONY filed a petition for rehearing with the NYSPSC. CECONY is unable to predict the NYSPSC's response to its rehearing petition.\nIn January 2018, the NYSPSC issued an order initiating a focused operations audit of the Utilities’ financial accounting for income taxes. The audit is investigating the Utilities’ inadvertent understatement of a portion, the amount of which may be material, of their calculation of total federal income tax expense for ratemaking purposes related to the calculation of plant retirement-related cost of removal. As a result of such understatement, the Utilities accumulated significant income tax regulatory assets ($\n1,078\n million and $\n14\n million for CECONY and O&R, respectively, as of December 31,2024 and $\n1,113\n million and $\n18\n million for CECONY and O&R, respectively, as of December 31, 2023) which are not earning a return. While the Utilities have properly calculated and paid their federal income taxes and there is no uncertain tax position related to this matter, this understatement of historical income tax expense materially reduced the amount of revenue collected from the Utilities' customers in the past relative to what it should have been. The Utilities’ rate plans have reflected the correct amount of federal income taxes recoverable from customers, including a proportionate recovery of the regulatory asset, beginning with O&R’s rate plans effective November 2015, CECONY’s electric and gas rate plans effective January 2017, and CECONY’s steam plan effective November 2023. As part of the audit, the Utilities plan to pursue a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) confirming that the Utilities’ inadvertent understatement of prior years’ income tax expense constitutes a normalization violation that can be cured through an increase in future years’ revenue requirements until such time as the regulatory asset is fully recovered in rates, and not through a write-down of all or a portion of the Utilities’ regulatory asset. Under Accounting Standards Codification Topic (ASC) 740, the Utilities recorded an unfunded deferred federal income tax liability (with a gross-up amount) and a corresponding regulatory asset. The income tax regulatory assets are netted against the related regulatory liability for future income tax and are shown in the line “Future income tax” in the following table of Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and on the Companies’ consolidated balance sheets in the line “Regulatory liabilities.” Management’s assessment is that the income tax regulatory assets as of December 31, 2024 are probable of collection through future rates. The IRS provides safe harbor relief for inadvertent normalization violations through the jurisdictional rate setting process of including in rates adequate revenue to fully recover the deferred tax balance. However, the Utilities would record a liability or impair a portion of the regulatory assets associated with this understatement if the NYSPSC were to issue an order that required the Utilities to write off all or a portion of their existing regulatory asset. The Utilities are unable to estimate the amount or range of their possible loss, if any, related to this matter. At December 31, 2024, the Utilities had not accrued a liability related to this matter.\n130\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nRegulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were comprised of the following items:\n                  Con Edison\n                CECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nRegulatory assets\nEnergy efficiency and other clean energy programs (a)\n$\n1,656\n$\n1,251\n$\n1,598\n$\n1,223\nCustomer account deferrals (b)\n1,073\n789\n1,058\n782\nEnvironmental remediation costs\n1,038\n1,105\n952\n1,022\nRevenue taxes\n540\n476\n517\n455\nLegacy meters (c)\n413\n17\n398\n—\nDeferred storm costs (d)\n147\n206\n53\n115\nProperty tax reconciliation (e)\n131\n169\n131\n169\nDeferred derivative losses - long term\n106\n163\n94\n148\nMTA power reliability deferral (f)\n31\n61\n31\n61\nGas service line deferred costs\n18\n43\n18\n43\nPension and other postretirement benefits deferrals\n2\n48\n2\n39\nOther\n368\n279\n306\n257\nRegulatory assets – noncurrent\n5,523\n4,607\n5,158\n4,314\nDeferred derivative losses - short term\n102\n269\n92\n253\nRecoverable energy costs\n39\n12\n14\n1\nRegulatory assets – current\n141\n281\n106\n254\nTotal Regulatory Assets\n$\n5,664\n$\n4,888\n$\n5,264\n$\n4,568\nRegulatory liabilities\nAllowance for cost of removal less salvage (g)\n$\n1,527\n$\n1,456\n$\n1,322\n$\n1,266\nFuture income tax*\n1,224\n \n1,535\n \n1,112\n \n1,404\n \nUnrecognized pension and other postretirement costs (h)\n1,054\n943\n984\n867\nNet unbilled revenue deferrals\n436\n278\n436\n278\nPension and other postretirement benefit deferrals\n368\n284\n304\n233\nLate payment charge deferral\n231\n167\n224\n161\nSystem benefit charge carrying charge\n115\n92\n110\n88\nNet proceeds from sale of property\n25\n48\n24\n47\nSettlement of prudence proceeding (i)\n10\n11\n10\n11\nDeferred derivative gains - long term\n8\n49\n6\n49\nOther\n446\n465\n408\n414\nRegulatory liabilities – noncurrent\n5,444\n5,328\n4,940\n4,818\nRefundable energy costs\n59\n71\n18\n36\nDeferred derivative gains - short term\n25\n74\n22\n71\nRevenue decoupling mechanism\n18\n—\n—\n—\n \nRegulatory liabilities—current\n102\n145\n40\n107\nTotal Regulatory Liabilities\n$\n5,546\n$\n5,473\n$\n4,980\n$\n4,925\n* See \"Federal Income Tax\" in Note A, \"Other Regulatory Matters,\" above, and Note L.\n(a)  Energy Efficiency and Other Clean Energy Programs represent programs designed to increase energy efficiency achievements and other clean energy transformation efforts.\n(b)  Customer account deferrals include (1) the amount to be collected from customers related to the Emergency Summer Cooling Credits program for CECONY, (2) deferrals under CECONY and O&R's electric and gas rate plans for the reconciliation of write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances to amounts reflected in rates as well as for increases to the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and (3) deferral related to the arrears relief programs. Amounts deferred under the arrears relief programs were $\n323.7\n million and $\n1.4\n million for CECONY and O&R at December 31, 2024, respectively, and $\n398.6\n million and $\n2.1\n million at December 31, 2023, respectively, and receive a return at the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.\n(c)  Pursuant to their rate plans, CECONY and O&R are recovering the costs of legacy meters over a 15-year period beginning January 1, 2024 and a 12-year period beginning January 1, 2022, respectively.\n(d)  Deferred storm costs represent response and restoration costs, other than capital expenditures, in connection with Tropical Storm Isaias and other major storms that were deferred by the Utilities.\n(e)  Property tax reconciliation represents the amount deferred between actual property taxes incurred and the level included in rates subject to the provisions of the respective rate plans.\n(f)  MTA power reliability deferral represents CECONY’s costs in excess of those reflected in its prior electric rate plan to take certain actions relating to the electrical equipment that serves the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) subway system.

See \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\" in Note A.\n(i)  Settlement of prudence proceeding represents the remaining amount to be credited to customers pursuant to a Joint Proposal, approved by the NYSPSC in April 2016, with respect to the prudence of certain CECONY expenditures and related matters.\nThe NYSPSC has authorized CECONY to accrue unbilled electric, gas and steam revenues. CECONY has deferred the differences between unbilled revenues and energy costs for the future benefit of customers by recording a regulatory liability of $\n436\n million and $\n278\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIn general, the Utilities receive or are being credited with a return at the Other Customer-Provided Capital rate for regulatory assets that have not been included in rate base, and receive or are being credited with a return at the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital once the asset is included in rate base. Similarly, the Utilities pay to or credit customers with a return at the Other Customer-Provided Capital rate for regulatory liabilities that have not been included in rate base, and pay to or credit customers with a return at the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital once the liability is included in rate base. The Other Customer-Provided Capital rate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was \n5.95\n percent and \n5.20\n percent, respectively. \nIn general, the Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made ($\n3,262\n million and $\n2,541\n million for Con Edison, and $\n3,024\n million and $\n2,359\n million for CECONY at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively). Regulatory assets of RECO for which a cash outflow has been made ($\n28\n million and $\n24\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively) are not receiving or being credited with a return. RECO recovers regulatory assets over a period of up to \nfour years\n or until they are addressed in its next base rate case in accordance with the rate provisions approved by the NJBPU. Regulatory liabilities are treated in a consistent manner.\nRegulatory assets that represent future financial obligations and were deferred in accordance with the Utilities’ rate plans or orders issued by state regulators do not earn a return until such time as a cash outlay has been made. Regulatory liabilities are treated in a consistent manner. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY that did not earn a return consisted of the following items:\nRegulatory Assets Not Earning a Return*\n                  Con Edison\n                CECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nEnvironmental remediation costs\n$\n1,037\n$\n1,105\n$\n942\n$\n1,022\nRevenue taxes\n567\n490\n543\n470\nUB deferral for uncollectible accounts receivable\n551\n291\n541\n288\nDeferred derivative losses - long term\n106\n163\n94\n148\nDeferred derivative losses - short term\n102\n269\n92\n253\nOther\n39\n29\n28\n28\nTotal\n$\n2,402\n$\n2,347\n$\n2,240\n$\n2,209\n*This table presents regulatory assets not earning a return for which no cash outlay has been made.\n \nThe recovery periods for regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has not been made and that do not earn a return have not yet been determined, except as noted below, and are expected to be determined pursuant to the Utilities’ future rate plans to be filed or orders issued by the state regulators in connection therewith.\nThe Utilities recover unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs over 10 years, and the portion of investment gains or losses recognized in expense over 15 years, pursuant to NYSPSC policy. \nThe deferral for revenue taxes represents the New York State metropolitan transportation business tax surcharge on the cumulative temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities of the Utilities, as well as the difference between taxes collected and paid by the Utilities to fund mass transportation. The Utilities recover the majority of the revenue taxes over the remaining book lives of the electric and gas plant assets, as well as the steam plant assets for CECONY.\n132\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nThe Utilities recover deferred derivative losses – current within \none year\n, and noncurrent generally within \nthree years\n.\nNote C – \nCapitalization\nCommon Stock\nCon Edison is authorized to issue \n500,000,000\n shares of its common stock and CECONY is authorized to issue \n340,000,000\n of its common stock. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, \n346,597,693\n and \n345,415,772\n shares, respectively, of Con Edison common stock were outstanding. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, \n235,488,094\n million shares of CECONY common stock were outstanding, all of which were owned by Con Edison. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Con Edison had \n33,753,963\n treasury shares, including \n21,976,200\n shares of Con Edison stock that CECONY purchased prior to 2001 in connection with Con Edison’s stock repurchase plan and \n10,543,263\n common shares of Con Edison purchased in 2023 in connection with Con Edison's accelerated share repurchase agreements. CECONY presents in the financial statements the cost of the Con Edison stock it owns as a reduction of common shareholder’s equity.\nIn December 2024, Con Edison entered into a forward sale agreement relating to \n7,000,000\n of its common shares. The company expects the common shares under the forward sale agreement to settle by December 31, 2025. The company or the forward purchaser may accelerate the forward sale agreement upon the occurrence of certain events. On a settlement date, if the company decides to physically settle, it will issue shares to the forward purchaser at the then-applicable forward sale price. The forward sale price is equal to $\n96.66\n per share and is subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor less a spread, and will be subject to decrease on each of certain dates by amounts related to expected dividends. The common shares under the forward sale agreement will be physically settled, unless the company elects cash settlement or net share settlement (which it has the right to do, subject to certain conditions, other than in limited circumstances). In the event the company elects to cash settle or net share settle, the settlement amount will be generally related to (1) (a) the market value of the common shares during the unwind period under the forward sale agreement minus (b) the applicable adjusted forward sale price; multiplied by (2) the number of shares subject to such cash settlement or net share settlement. If this settlement amount is a negative number, the forward purchaser will pay the company the absolute value of that amount or deliver to the company a number of shares having a value equal to the absolute value of such amount. If this settlement amount is a positive number, the company will pay the forward purchaser that amount or deliver to the forward purchaser a number of shares having a value equal to such amount. No amounts have been or will be recorded to the consolidated financial statements with respect to the equity offering until any settlement of the forward sale agreement occurs.\nIn 2023, Con \nEdison entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with \ntwo\n dealers to repurchase $\n1,000\n million in aggregate of Con Edison’s Common Shares ($\n.10\n par value) (Common Shares). The settlement of the accelerated share repurchase agreements occurred in the second quarter of 2023. Con Edison made payments of $\n1,000\n million in aggregate to the dealers and received deliveries of \n10,543,263\n Common Shares in aggregate.\nCon Edison recorded the 2023 accelerated share repurchases as equity transactions, and at the time of receipt, shares were included in treasury stock at fair market value as of the corresponding trade date. Con Edison reflected shares received as a repurchase of common stock in the weighted average common shares outstanding calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share.\nCapitalization of Con Edison\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Con Edison's capitalization shown on its Consolidated Statement of Capitalization includes its outstanding common stock and long-term debt and the outstanding long-term debt of the Utilities.\nDividends \nIn accordance with NYSPSC requirements, the dividends that the Utilities generally pay are limited to not more than \n100\n percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a \ntwo–year\n rolling average basis. See Note U. Excluded from the calculation of “income available for dividends” are non-cash charges to income resulting from accounting changes or charges to income resulting from significant unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to dividends paid in order to transfer to Con Edison proceeds from major transactions, such as asset sales, or to dividends reducing each utility subsidiary’s equity ratio to a level appropriate to its business risk.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n133\n                      \nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt maturing in the period 2025-2029 is as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCon Edison\n(a)\nCECONY\n2025\n$\n—\n$\n—\n2026\n250\n250\n2027\n780\n700\n2028\n800\n800\n2029\n44\n—\n(a)\nAmounts shown exclude $\n59\n million of debt for Broken Bow II, a deferred project, which was classified as held for sale as of December 31, \n2024 and is shown under “Project Debt Held for Sale\" on Con Edison's Consolidated Statement of Capitalization. See \"Assets Held for Sale\" in Note A and Note X for additional information. The sale and transfer of Broken Bow II, including the related debt, was completed in January 2025.\nAt December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, long-term debt of CECONY included $\n225\n million and \n$\n450\n million\n, respectively, of tax–exempt debt through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) that bore interest at a rate determined weekly and was subject to tender by bondholders for purchase by the company.\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of long-term debt at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are:\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\nLong-Term Debt (including current portion) (a)\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nCon Edison (b)\n$\n24,651\n$\n21,997\n$\n22,177\n$\n20,525\nCECONY\n23,409\n20,915\n21,060\n19,517\n(a)\nAmounts shown are net of unamortized debt expense and unamortized debt discount of $\n249\n million and $\n241\n million for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and $\n222\n million and $\n215\n million for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\n(b)\nAmounts shown exclude the debt of Broken Bow II, a deferred project that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023 and is shown under “Project Debt Held for Sale\" on Con Edison's Consolidated Statement of Capitalization. The carrying value and fair value of Broken Bow II's long-term debt, including the current portion, as of December 31, 2024 was $\n59\n million and $\n54\n million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2023 was $\n62\n million and $\n58\n million, respectively. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X. The sale and transfer of Broken Bow II, including the related debt, was completed in January 2025. See Note W.\nThe fair values of the Companies' long-term debt have been estimated primarily using available market information and at December 31, 2024 are classified as Level 2 liabilities (see Note R).\nSignificant Debt Covenants\nThe significant debt covenants under the financing arrangements for the Companies' debentures include obligations to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other entity unless certain conditions are met. The Companies' debentures have no cross default provisions. The tax–exempt financing arrangements of CECONY are subject to covenants for the debentures discussed above and the covenants discussed below. The Companies were in compliance with their significant debt covenants at December 31, 2024.\nThe tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory notes of CECONY to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of tax–exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA. The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the tax–exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The arrangements include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default for the debt to which such provisions applied.\nThe failure to comply with debt covenants would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default for the debt to which such provisions applied. If an event of default were to occur, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default applied and, in the case of the Con Edison notes, a make-whole premium might and, in the case of certain events of default would, become due and payable immediately.\n134\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nThe liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the tax–exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of CECONY will not at any time exceed \n0.65\n to 1 and that, subject to certain exceptions, CECONY will not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default, defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of $\n100\n million.\nNote D – \nShort-Term Borrowing\nIn March 2023, Con Edison and the Utilities entered into a $\n2,500\n million credit agreement that replaced a December 2016 credit agreement, under which banks are committed to provide loans and letters of credit on a revolving credit basis. In March 2024, Con Edison and the Utilities also entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement (as so amended, the Credit Agreement) that, among other things, amended the mechanics relating to determining the interest rate to be paid with respect to a “Term SOFR Loan.” The Credit Agreement expires in March 2029, unless extended for up to one additional \none-year\n term. There is a maximum of $\n2,500\n million of credit available to CECONY and $\n800\n million (subject to increase up to $\n1,000\n million) available to Con Edison, including up to $\n900\n million of letters of credit. The Companies have not borrowed under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement supports the Companies’ commercial paper programs. Loans and letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement may also be used for other general corporate purposes. Any borrowings under the Credit Agreement would generally be at variable interest rates.\nIn March 2024, CECONY entered into a \n364-Day\n Revolving Credit Agreement (the CECONY Credit Agreement) that replaced a March 2023 CECONY \n364-Day\n Credit Agreement, under which banks are committed to provide loans up to $\n500\n million on a revolving credit basis. The CECONY Credit Agreement expires in March 2025 and supports CECONY’s commercial paper program. Loans issued under the CECONY Credit Agreement may also be used for other general corporate purposes. Any borrowings under the CECONY Credit Agreement would generally be at variable interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2024, Con Edison had $\n2,170\n million of commercial paper outstanding, of which $\n1,694\n million was outstanding under CECONY’s program. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2024 was \n4.7\n percent for both Con Edison and CECONY. At December 31, 2023, Con Edison had $\n2,288\n million of commercial paper outstanding of which $\n1,903\n million was outstanding under CECONY’s program. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2023 was \n5.6\n percent for both Con Edison and CECONY. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nno\n loans or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement and no loans were outstanding under the CECONY Credit Agreement. \nThe banks’ commitments under the Credit Agreement and the CECONY Credit Agreement are subject to certain conditions, including that there be no event of default. The commitments are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels or the absence of a material adverse change. Upon a change of control of, or upon an event of default by one of the Companies under the Credit Agreement or by CECONY under the CECONY Credit Agreement, the banks may terminate their commitments with respect to that company, declare any amounts owed by that company  immediately due and payable and  for the Credit Agreement, require that company to provide cash collateral relating to the letters of credit issued for it under the Credit Agreement. Events of default for a company include that company exceeding at any time of a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capital of \n0.65\n to 1 (at December 31, 2024 this ratio was \n0.56\n to 1 for Con Edison and \n0.57\n to 1 for CECONY); that company having liens on its assets in an aggregate amount exceeding 10 percent of its consolidated net tangible assets, subject to certain exceptions; that company or any of its material subsidiaries failing to make one or more payments in respect of material financial obligations (in excess of an aggregate $\n150\n million of debt or derivative obligations other than non-recourse debt) of that company; the occurrence of an event or condition which results in the acceleration of the maturity of any material debt (in excess of an aggregate $\n150\n million of debt other than non-recourse debt) of that company or enables the holders of such debt to accelerate the maturity thereof; and other customary events of default. Interest and fees charged for the revolving credit facilities and any loans made or letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reflect the Companies’ respective credit ratings. The Companies were in compliance with their significant debt covenants at December 31, 2024.\nIn November 2024 and January 2025, CECONY borrowed $\n500\n million and $\n200\n million, respectively, at a variable rate under a \n364-Day\n Senior Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement entered into by the company in November 2024 (the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement). The term loans mature in November 2025. CECONY has the option to prepay the term loans issued under the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement prior to maturity. CECONY intends to use borrowings under the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n135\n                      \nUpon a change of control of CECONY or Con Edison, or upon an event of default by CECONY, the banks may declare the loans outstanding under the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement immediately due and payable.

The decrease in the pension funded status at December 31, 2023 for Con Edison and CECONY of $\n174\n million and $\n156\n million, respectively, compared with December 31, 2022, was primarily due to an increase in the plan's projected benefit obligation as a result of a decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by a return on plan assets that was greater than the expected return. See below for further information on the change in the discount rate and determination of the discount rate assumption. For Con Edison, the 2024 increase in pension funded status asset corresponds with an increase to regulatory liabilities of $\n86\n million for unrecognized net gains and unrecognized prior service credits associated with the Utilities consistent with the accounting rules for regulated operations, a credit to OCI of $\n5\n million (net of taxes) for the unrecognized net gains, and an immaterial change to OCI (net of taxes) for the unrecognized prior service credits associated with certain employees of Con Edison Transmission and RECO who previously worked for the Utilities. For 2024, included within the funded status are noncurrent liabilities of $\n319\n million and $\n296\n million for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively, and current liabilities of $\n63\n million and $\n60\n million for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively. For 2023, included within the funded status are noncurrent liabilities of $\n337\n million and $\n313\n million for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively. For 2022, included within the funded status are noncurrent liabilities of $\n311\n million and $\n287\n million for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively. \nFor CECONY, the increase in pension funded status asset at December 31, 2024 corresponds with an increase to regulatory liabilities of $\n101\n million for unrecognized net gains and unrecognized prior service credits consistent with the accounting rules for regulated operations, and also a credit to OCI of $\n7\n million (net of taxes) for unrecognized net gains, and an immaterial change to OCI (net of taxes) for the unrecognized prior service costs associated with certain employees of Con Edison Transmission who previously worked for CECONY.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Con Edison’s investments included $\n583\n million and $\n524\n million, respectively, held in external trust accounts for benefit payments pursuant to the supplemental retirement plans. Included in these amounts for CECONY were $\n560\n million\n \nand $\n502\n million, respectively. See Note R. The accumulated benefit obligations for the supplemental retirement plans for Con Edison and CECONY were $\n380\n million and $\n354\n million as of December 31, 2024, respectively, and $\n349\n million and $\n323\n million as of December 31, 2023, respectively.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n137\n                      \nAssumptions\nThe actuarial assumptions were as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:\nDiscount rate\n5.70\n \n%\n5.15\n \n%\n5.45\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate for cash balance plan\n4.30\n \n%\n4.20\n \n%\n4.00\n \n%\nRate of compensation increase\nCECONY\n3.80\n \n%\n3.80\n \n%\n3.80\n \n%\nO&R\n3.20\n \n%\n3.20\n \n%\n3.20\n \n%\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31:\nDiscount rate\n5.15\n \n%\n5.45\n \n%\n3.00\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate for cash balance plan\n4.20\n \n%\n4.00\n \n%\n3.50\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n6.75\n \n%\n6.75\n \n%\n7.00\n \n%\nRate of compensation increase\nCECONY\n3.80\n \n%\n3.80\n \n%\n3.80\n \n%\nO&R\n3.20\n \n%\n3.20\n \n%\n3.20\n \n%\nThe expected return assumption reflects anticipated returns on the plan’s current and future assets. The Companies’ expected return was based on an evaluation of the current environment, market and economic outlook, relationships between the economy and asset class performance patterns, and recent and long-term trends in asset class performance. The projections were based on the plan’s target asset allocation.\nDiscount Rate Assumption\nTo determine the assumed discount rate, the Companies use a model that produces a yield curve based on discounting plan specific cash flows with corresponding spot rates on a yield curve. Term structures of interest rates are based on AA rated corporate bonds. Bonds with questionable pricing information and bonds that are not representative of the overall market are excluded from consideration. For example, the bonds used in the model cannot be callable (with the exception of \"make whole\" callable bonds). The spot rates defined by the yield curve and the plan’s projected benefit payments are used to develop a weighted average discount rate.\nExpected Benefit Payments\nBased on current assumptions, the Companies expect to make the following benefit payments over the next ten years:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCon Edison\nCECONY\n2025\n$\n840\n$\n781\n2026\n808\n749\n2027\n820\n764\n2028\n824\n766\n2029\n836\n778\n2030-2034\n$\n4,227\n$\n3,952\nExpected Contributions\nBased on estimates as of December 31, 2024, the Companies expect to make contributions to the pension plans during 2025 of $\n3\n million (none of which is to be made by CECONY). The Companies’ policy is to fund the total periodic benefit cost, if any, of the qualified plan to the extent tax deductible and to also contribute to the non-qualified supplemental plans.\n138\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nPlan Assets\nThe asset allocations for the pension plan at the end of 2024, 2023 and 2022, and the target allocation for 2025 are as follows:\n  \nTarget\nAllocation Range\n           Plan Assets at December 31,\nAsset Category\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEquity Securities\n26\n% - \n30\n%\n27\n \n%\n26\n \n%\n33\n \n%\nDebt Securities\n42\n% - \n60\n%\n51\n \n%\n50\n \n%\n50\n \n%\nReal Estate and Other Alternatives\n14\n% - \n30\n%\n22\n \n%\n24\n \n%\n17\n \n%\nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\nCon Edison has established a pension trust for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing retirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries and payment of plan expenses.\nPursuant to resolutions adopted by Con Edison’s Board of Directors, the Named Fiduciary Committee (the Committee) has general oversight responsibility for Con Edison’s pension and other employee benefit plans. The pension plan’s named fiduciaries have been granted the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plans, including overall responsibility for the investment of assets in the trust and the power to appoint and terminate investment managers.\nThe investment objectives of the Con Edison pension plan are to maintain a level and form of assets adequate to meet benefit obligations to participants, to achieve the expected long-term total return on the trust assets within a prudent level of risk and maintain a level of volatility that is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s expected contribution and expense or the company’s ability to meet plan obligations. The assets of the plan have no significant concentration of risk in one country (other than the United States), industry or entity.\nThe strategic asset allocation is intended to meet the objectives of the pension plan by diversifying its funds across asset classes, investment styles and fund managers. An asset/liability study typically is conducted every few years to determine whether the current strategic asset allocation continues to represent the appropriate balance of expected risk and reward for the plan to meet expected liabilities. Each study considers the investment risk of the asset allocation and determines the optimal asset allocation for the plan. The target asset allocation for 2025 reflects the results of such a study conducted in 2022.\nIndividual fund managers operate under written guidelines provided by Con Edison that cover such areas as investment objectives, performance measurement, permissible investments, investment restrictions, trading and execution, and communication and reporting requirements. Con Edison management regularly monitors and the named fiduciaries review asset class performance, total fund performance, and compliance with asset allocation guidelines. Management changes fund managers and rebalances the portfolio as appropriate. \nThe Utilities each participate in the Con Edison Retirement Plan, the assets of which are held in the pension trust. In accordance with the Utilities' current rate plans, pension plan costs and liabilities are allocated to each of the Utilities based on plan participant-level data, while pension plan assets are allocated based on historical and current amounts of contributions, if any, disbursements, and investment returns. Pension plan assets for Con Edison are shown below. Of the amounts disclosed below for Con Edison, 95% are attributable to CECONY.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n139\n                      \nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as defined by the accounting rules for fair value measurements (see Note R).\nThe fair values of the pension plan assets at December 31, 2024 by asset category are as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nTotal\nInvestments within the fair value hierarchy\nU.S. Equity (a)\n$\n2,752\n$\n—\n \n$\n2,752\nInternational Equity (b)\n1,508\n—\n1,508\nU.S. Government Issued Debt (c)\n—\n619\n619\nCorporate Bonds Debt (d)\n—\n5,429\n5,429\nStructured Assets Debt (e)\n—\n159\n159\nOther Fixed Income Debt (f)\n—\n783\n783\nCommingled Trust Fund (g)\n—\n478\n478\nCash and Cash Equivalents (h)\n51\n292\n343\nFutures (i)\n(\n4\n)\n— \n(\n4\n)\nTotal investments within the fair value hierarchy \n$\n4,307\n$\n7,760\n$\n12,067\nInvestments measured at NAV per share (o)\nPrivate Equity (j)\n975\nReal Estate (k)\n1,609\nHedge Funds (l)\n788\nTotal investments valued using NAV per share\n$\n3,372\nFunds for retiree health benefits (m)\n(\n50\n)\n(\n90\n)\n(\n140\n)\nFunds for retiree health benefits measured at NAV per share (m)(o)\n(\n39\n)\nTotal funds for retiree health benefits\n$(\n179\n)\nInvestments (excluding funds for retiree health benefits)\n$\n4,257\n$\n7,670\n$\n15,260\nPending activities (n)\n \n \n18\nTotal fair value of plan net assets\n \n \n$\n15,278\n(a)\nU.S. Equity is comprised of both actively- and passively-managed investments in domestic equity index funds and actively-managed small-capitalization equities.\n(b)\nInternational Equity is comprised of investments in international equity index funds and actively-managed international equities.\n(c)\nU.S. Government Issued Debt is comprised of agency and treasury securities.\n(d)\nCorporate Bonds Debt is comprised of debt issued by various corporations.\n(e)\nStructured Assets Debt is comprised of commercial-mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.\n(f)\nOther Fixed Income Debt is comprised of municipal bonds, sovereign debt and regional governments.\n(g)\nCommingled Trust Fund is comprised of an actively managed commingled trust fund benchmarked to the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index.\n(h)\nCash and Cash Equivalents are comprised of short term investments, money markets, foreign currency and cash collateral.\n(i)\nFutures are comprised of exchange-traded financial contracts encompassing U.S. Equity, International Equity and U.S. Government indices.\n(j)\nPrivate Equity is comprised of global private market investments. Private equity's investment objective is to generate returns on capital from a diversified portfolio of primary fund investments, secondaries and co-investments. The plan's unfunded commitments to private equity were approximately $\n180\n million at December 31, 2024. However, the managers also expect to make significant cash flow distributions in 2025 and 2026. While the investments in this asset class cannot be redeemed, the plan would be able to receive distributions from selling its limited partnership interests in the secondary market, which would be expected to take \nthree\n to \nsix months\n.\n(k)\nReal Estate investments are open-end real estate funds that invest in a portfolio of real properties that are broadly diversified by geography and property type. The real estate asset class is expected to produce returns from  income and capital appreciation. Real estate also provides a hedge against inflation. The funds allow for quarterly redemptions, however the amount and timing of distributions are subject to market conditions and are currently uncertain.  \n(l)\nHedge Funds are structured as a custom fund of one and can invest in external hedge fund managers that pursue a wide array of strategies including event driven, fundamental long/short, relative value, directional trading, and direct sourcing. These investments seek to generate positive absolute returns with lower volatility than other investments. The various hedge fund managers can invest in all financial instruments.  Substantially all of the investment could be liquidated within \n18\n months.\n(m)\nThe Companies set aside funds for retiree health benefits through a separate account within the pension trust, as permitted under Section 401(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In accordance with the Code, the plan’s investments in the 401(h) account may not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than providing health benefits for retirees. The net assets held in the 401(h) account are calculated based on a pro-rata percentage allocation of the net assets in the pension plan. The related obligations for health benefits are not included in the pension plan’s obligations and are included in the Companies’ other postretirement benefit obligation.

Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws, including their manufactured gas plant sites and any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated, are referred to herein as “Superfund Sites.”\nFor Superfund Sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the amount the Utilities will need to pay to investigate and, where determinable, discharge their related obligations. For Superfund Sites (including the manufactured gas plant sites) for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the company’s share of the undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate the sites, if remediation is necessary and if a reasonable estimate of such cost can be made. Remediation costs are estimated in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards and experience with similar sites.\nThe accrued liabilities and regulatory assets related to Superfund Sites at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n  \n                  Con Edison\n                CECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAccrued Liabilities:\nManufactured gas plant sites\n$\n941\n$\n1,016\n$\n846\n$\n924\nOther Superfund Sites\n96\n102\n96\n102\nTotal\n$\n1,037\n$\n1,118\n$\n942\n$\n1,026\nRegulatory assets\n$\n1,038\n$\n1,105\n$\n952\n$\n1,022\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n147\n                      \nMost of the accrued Superfund Site liability relates to sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. However, for some of the sites, the extent and associated cost of the required remediation has not yet been determined. As investigations progress and information pertaining to the required remediation becomes available, the Utilities expect that additional liability may be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be materia\nl. The Utilities defer prudently incurred investigation and remediation costs as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates).\nEnvironmental remediation costs incurred related to Superfund Sites at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n  \n                 Con Edison\n                 CECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nRemediation costs incurred\n$\n44\n$\n13\n$\n44\n$\n12\nInsurance and other third party recoveries received by Con Edison or CECONY were immaterial in 2024 and 2023. \nCo\nn Edison and CECONY estimate that in 2025 they will incur costs for remediation of approximately $\n39\n million and $\n38\n million, respectively. The Companies are unable to estimate the time period over which the remaining accrued liability will be incurred because, among other things, the required remediation has not been determined\n for some of the sites.\nIn 2024, Con Edison and CECONY estimated that for their manufactured gas plant sites (including CECONY’s Astoria site), the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and remediation of coal tar and/or other environmental contaminants could range up to $\n3,391\n million and $\n3,237\n million, respectively. These estimates were based on the assumption that there is contamination at all sites, including those that have not yet been fully investigated and additional assumptions about the extent of the contamination and the type and extent of the remediation that may be required. Actual experience may be materially different.\nAsbestos Proceedings\nSuits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, that are many, have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars; however, the Utilities believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, based on the disposition of previous claims. At December 31, 2024, Con Edison and CECONY have accrued their estimated aggregate undiscounted potential liabilities for these suits and additional suits that may be brought through 2035 as shown in the following table. These estimates were based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment. Courts have applied, and may continue to apply, different standards for determining liability in asbestos suits than the standard that applied historically. As a result, the Companies currently believe that there is a reasonable possibility of an exposure to loss in excess of the liability accrued for the suits. The Companies are unable to estimate the amount or range of such loss. In addition, certain current and former employees have claimed or are claiming workers’ compensation benefits based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. CECONY is permitted to defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) costs incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and workers’ compensation claims. \nThe accrued liability for asbestos suits and workers’ compensation proceedings (including those related to asbestos exposure) and the amounts deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities for the Companies at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n  \n                Con Edison\n               CECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAccrued liability – asbestos suits\n$\n8\n$\n8\n$\n7\n$\n7\nRegulatory assets – asbestos suits\n8\n8\n7\n7\nAccrued liability – workers’ compensation\n53\n56\n51\n54\nRegulatory liabilities – workers’ compensation\n20\n17\n20\n17\n148\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nNote H – \nMaterial Contingencies\nManhattan Explosion and Fire\nOn March 12, 2014, \ntwo\n multi-use five-story tall buildings located on Park Avenue between 116th and 117th Streets in Manhattan were destroyed by an explosion and fire. CECONY had delivered gas to the buildings through service lines from a distribution main located below ground on Park Avenue. \nEight\n people died and more than \n50\n people were injured. Additional buildings were also damaged. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated. The parties to the investigation included CECONY, the City of New York, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the NYSPSC. In June 2015, the NTSB issued a final report concerning the incident, its probable cause and safety recommendations. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the incident was (1) the failure of a defective fusion joint at a service tee (which joined a plastic service line to a plastic distribution main) installed by CECONY that allowed gas to leak from the distribution main and migrate into a building where it ignited and (2) a breach in a city sewer line that allowed groundwater and soil to flow into the sewer, resulting in a loss of support for the distribution main, that caused it to sag and overstressed the defective fusion joint. The NTSB also made safety recommendations, including recommendations to CECONY that addressed its procedures for the preparation and examination of plastic fusions, training of its staff on conditions for notifications to the city’s Fire Department and extension of its gas main isolation valve installation program. In February 2017, the NYSPSC approved a settlement agreement with CECONY related to the NYSPSC's investigations of the incident and the practices of qualifying persons to perform plastic fusions. Pursuant to the agreement, CECONY provided $\n27\n million of future benefits to customers (for which it accrued a regulatory liability) and did not recover from customers $\n126\n million of costs for gas emergency response activities that it had previously incurred and expensed. Lawsuits are pending against CECONY seeking generally unspecified damages and, in some cases, punitive damages, for wrongful death, personal injury, property damage and business interruption. CECONY notified its insurers of the incident and believes that the policies in force at the time of the incident will cover CECONY's costs, in excess of a required retention (the amount of which is not material), to satisfy any liability it may have for damages in connection with the incident. During 2020, CECONY accrued its estimated liability for the suits of $\n40\n million and an insurance receivable in the same amount, and such estimated liability and receivable did not change as of December 31, 2024. \nOther Contingencies\nFor additional contingencies, see “Other Regulatory Matters” in Note B, Note G and \"Uncertain Tax Positions\" in Note L.\nGuarantees\nCon Edison and its subsidiaries have entered into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance primarily to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries.

The Utilities recover their purchased power and gas costs in accordance with provisions approved by the applicable state public utility regulators. See “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A. The Utilities also conducted auctions and have entered into various other electricity and gas purchase agreements. Assuming performance by the parties to the electricity purchase agreements, the Utilities are obligated over the terms of the agreements to make capacity and other fixed payments.\nThe future capacity and other fixed payments under the electricity and gas purchase agreements are estimated to be as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nAll Years\nThereafter\nCon Edison\nElectricity power purchase agreements\n$\n234\n$\n131\n$\n60\n$\n49\n$\n44\n$\n302\nNatural gas\n383\n11\n8\n—\n—\n—\nGas transportation and storage\n510\n497\n450\n376\n212\n2,390\nCECONY\nElectricity power purchase agreements\n230\n128\n59\n49\n44\n302\nNatural gas\n331\n10\n7\n—\n—\n—\nGas transportation and storage\n445\n434\n394\n329\n185\n2,083\nFor energy delivered and gas purchased under most of the electricity and gas purchase agreements, the Utilities are obligated to pay variable prices. \nThe company’s payments under the significant terms of the agreements for capacity, energy, gas transportation and storage, and other fixed payments in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n               For the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCon Edison\nAstoria Generating Company (a)\n$\n75\n$\n40\n$\n45\nBrooklyn Navy Yard (b)\n139\n134\n165\nGas Transportation and Storage (c)\n422\n372\n386\nTotal\n$\n636\n$\n546\n$\n596\nCECONY\nAstoria Generating Company (a)\n$\n75\n$\n40\n$\n45\nBrooklyn Navy Yard (b)\n139\n134\n165\nGas Transportation and Storage (c)\n372\n327\n340\nTotal\n$\n586\n$\n501\n$\n550\n(a)    Capacity purchase agreements with terms ending in 2024 through 2028.\n(b)    Contract for plant output, which started in 1996 and ends in 2036.\n(c)    Contracts for various counterparties and terms extending through 2046.\n        \n150\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nNote J – \nLeases \nThe \nCompanies lease land, office buildings, equipment and access rights to support electric transmission facilities. The Companies recognize lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets for virtually all of their leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease, the expense for which was immaterial). A lease right-of-use asset represents a right to use an identifiable underlying asset and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that asset for the lease term. A lease liability represents an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Leases are classified as either operating leases or finance leases. Operating leases of the Utilities are included in operating lease right-of-use asset and operating lease liabilities on the Companies’ consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in other noncurrent assets, other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities. The Utilities, as regulated entities, are permitted to continue to recognize expense for operating leases using the timing that conforms to the regulatory rate treatment as rental payments are recovered from our customers and to account the same way for finance leases. \nFor new operating leases, the Companies recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of the Companies’ leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Companies used their collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of future payments. Most of the Companies’ leases have remaining lease terms of \none year\n to \n20\n years and may include options to renew or extend the leases for up to \nfive years\n at the fair rental value. The Companies' lease terms include options to renew, extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Companies will exercise that option. There were no leases with material variable lease payments or residual value guarantees. The Companies account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. \nOperating lease cost and cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2024, \n2023,\n and 2022 were as follows:\nCon Edison (a)\nCECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating lease cost\n$\n67\n \n$\n70\n \n$\n88\n \n$\n66\n \n$\n66\n \n$\n67\n \nOperating lease cash flows\n$\n67\n \n$\n68\n \n$\n83\n \n$\n66\n \n$\n65\n \n$\n64\n \n(a)\nAmounts for Con Edison include amounts for the Clean Energy Businesses through February 2023.

Broken Bow II was sold and transferred in January 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2024, CECONY has lease agreements for clean energy facilities that have not yet commenced operation. These clean energy facility leases have lease terms of \n15\n years and are expected to commence operation within \ntwo years\n, for which the total present value is $\n262\n million. There were no material lease terminations for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe Companies are lessors under certain leases whereby the Companies own real estate and distribution poles and lease portions of them to others. Revenue under such leases was immaterial for Con Edison and CECONY for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \n152\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nNote K – \nGoodwill \nThe Companies test goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever there is a triggering event. There is an option to first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Substantially all of Con Edison's goodwill relates to the O&R merger. \nIn 2024 and 2023, Con Edison completed qualitative and quantitative impairment tests, respectively, for its goodwill of $\n406\n million related to the O&R merger and determined that the fair value of the reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value, and accordingly the goodwill was not impaired. For the impairment test, $\n245\n million and $\n161\n million of goodwill were allocated to CECONY and O&R, respectively. Con Edison used a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis in its quantitative impairment test. No impairments or triggering events were identified for Con Edison's goodwill for the years ending December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nEstimates of future cash flows, projected growth rates, and discount rates inherent in the cash flow estimates for Con Edison subsidiaries other than the Utilities may vary significantly from actual results, which could result in a future impairment of goodwill.\n \nNote L – \nIncome Tax\nThe components of income tax are as follows:\n  \nCon Edison\nCECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nState\nCurrent\n$(\n81\n)\n$\n179\n$\n5\n$(\n87\n)\n$(\n102\n)\n$\n—\nDeferred\n223\n6\n324\n219\n246\n110\nFederal\nCurrent\n(\n17\n)\n176\n \n58\n(\n63\n)\n(\n95\n)\n170\nDeferred\n198\n237\n117\n246\n311\n(\n23\n)\nAmortization of investment tax credits\n(\n5\n)\n(\n111\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nTotal income tax expense\n$\n318\n$\n487\n$\n498\n$\n314\n$\n358\n$\n255\nReconciliation of the difference between income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the prevailing statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes is as follows:\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n153\n                      \n  \nCon Edison\nCECONY\n(% of Pre-tax income)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSTATUTORY TAX RATE\nFederal\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\nChanges in computed taxes resulting from:\nState income taxes, net of federal income taxes\n5\n \n5\n \n6\n \n5\n \n5\n \n5\n \nCost of removal\n1\n \n1\n \n1\n \n1\n \n2\n \n1\n \nAllowance for uncollectible accounts, net of COVID-19 assistance\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nAmortization of excess deferred federal income taxes\n(\n10\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n10\n)\nOther\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nImpacts from the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses:\nChanges in state apportionments, net of federal income taxes \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDeferred unamortized ITC recognized on sale of subsidiary\n—\n \n(\n4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEffective tax rate\n15\n \n%\n16\n \n%\n24\n \n%\n15\n \n%\n18\n \n%\n16\n \n%\nThe tax effects of temporary differences, which gave rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, are as follows:\n  \n                Con Edison\n                CECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty basis differences\n$\n9,222\n$\n8,542\n$\n8,632\n$\n8,001\nRegulatory Assets:\n   Energy efficiency and other clean energy programs\n464\n351\n449\n344\n   Environmental remediation costs\n291\n310\n267\n287\n   Legacy meters\n116\n4\n112\n—\n   Other regulatory assets\n571\n574\n510\n525\nPensions and retiree benefits – asset\n1,063\n918\n1,037\n894\nOperating lease right-of-use asset\n143\n154\n142\n153\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n$\n11,870\n$\n10,853\n$\n11,149\n$\n10,204\nDeferred tax assets:\n   Regulatory liabilities:\n      Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs   \n296\n265\n276\n244\n      Future income tax\n343\n427\n312\n394\n      Other regulatory liabilities\n909\n844\n809\n744\nTax credits carryforward\n346\n270\n—\n—\nSuperfund and other environmental costs\n291\n314\n265\n288\nPensions and retiree benefits – liability\n154\n167\n142\n153\nCorporate alternative minimum tax credit carryforward\n139\n—\n111\n—\nOperating lease liabilities\n143\n154\n142\n153\nAsset retirement obligations\n127\n146\n127\n146\nEquity investments\n80\n98\n—\n—\nLoss carryforwards\n42\n7\n16\n—\nValuation allowance\n(\n12\n)\n(\n7\n)\n—\n—\nOther\n160\n125\n140\n109\nTotal deferred tax assets\n$\n3,018\n$\n2,810\n$\n2,340\n$\n2,231\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$\n8,852\n$\n8,043\n$\n8,809\n$\n7,973\nUnamortized investment tax credits\n22\n26\n10\n11\nNet deferred tax liabilities and unamortized investment tax credits\n$\n8,874\n$\n8,069\n$\n8,819\n$\n7,984\nAt December 31, 2024, Con Edison has $\n346\n million in general business tax credit carryovers (primarily renewable energy tax credits). If unused, these general business tax credit carryovers will begin to expire in 2038. A deferred \n154\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\ntax asset for these tax attribute carryforwards was recorded, and no valuation allowance was provided, as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized.   \nAt December 31, 2024, Con Edison has a deferred tax asset on its New York state net operating loss carryforward of $\n36\n million that will begin to expire, if unused, in 2040. No valuation allowance was provided, as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized.   \nAt December 31, 2024, Con Edison has a deferred tax asset on its New York City net operating loss carryforward of $\n14\n million that will begin to expire, if unused, in 2035. Con Edison increased its valuation allowance by $\n6\n million ($\n5\n million, net of federal tax) resulting in a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset as it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nIn April 2023, the IRS released Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures to maintain, repair, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property must be capitalized as improvements by the taxpayer or deducted for federal income tax purposes in the current tax year. This revenue procedure also provides procedures for taxpayers to obtain automatic consent to change their method of accounting to the safe harbor method of accounting. Con Edison adopted the safe harbor rules on its 2023 federal and state returns and recorded a reduction in its current tax payable and an increase in accumulated deferred tax liabilities of $\n457\n million, $\n418\n million of which is for CECONY and $\n39\n million of which is for O&R, to reflect the cumulative impact of this change in accounting method for the Utilities.\nCorporate Alternative Minimum Tax\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law and implemented a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) that imposes a 15 percent tax on modified GAAP net income. Pursuant to the IRA, corporations are entitled to a tax credit (minimum tax credit) to the extent the CAMT liability exceeds the regular tax liability. This amount can be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years when regular tax liability exceeds the CAMT liability.\nBeginning in 2024, based on the existing statute, the Companies are subject to and report the CAMT in their Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companies accrued a CAMT liability of $\n139\n million ($\n111\n million of which is for CECONY) before the application of general business credits, with an offsetting deferred tax asset representing the minimum tax credit carryforward, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The deferred tax asset related to the minimum tax credit carryforward will be realized to the extent the Companies’ consolidated deferred tax liabilities exceed the minimum tax credit carryforward. The Companies’ deferred tax liabilities are expected to exceed the minimum tax credit carryforward for the foreseeable future and thus no valuation allowance is required. The Companies are continuing to assess the impacts of the IRA on their financial statements and will update estimates based on future guidance to be issued by the Department of the Treasury.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nUnder the accounting rules for income taxes, the Companies are not permitted to recognize the tax benefit attributable to a tax position unless such position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for Con Edison and CECONY follows:\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n155\n                      \nCon Edison\nCECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at January 1,\n$\n11\n$\n23\n$\n17\n$\n7\n$\n8\n$\n5\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n4\n8\n3\n4\n4\n2\nAdditions based on tax positions of prior years\n—\n3\n6\n—\n1\n1\nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(\n6\n)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n6\n)\n—\nSettlements\n—\n(\n12\n)\n(\n2\n)\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at December 31,\n$\n9\n$\n11\n$\n23\n$\n5\n$\n7\n$\n8\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated uncertain tax positions for Con Edison was $\n9\n million ($\n5\n million for CECONY). For the year ended December 31, 2024, Con Edison recognized $\n4\n million of income tax expense related to current year positions and recognized a tax benefit of $\n3\n million related to positions in prior years, both of which were attributed to CECONY. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Con Edison concluded its federal tax examination for its 2022 tax return with no changes and reversed $\n3\n million in uncertain tax positions related to 2022 that reduced its effective tax rate. Con Edison and CECONY reasonably expects to resolve within the next twelve months approximately $\n1\n million of various federal uncertainties due to the expected completion of ongoing tax examinations, of which the entire amount, if recognized, would reduce the Companies’ effective tax rates.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would reduce Con Edison’s effective tax rate is $\n9\n million ($\n8\n million, net of federal taxes) with $\n5\n million attributable to CECONY.\nThe Companies recognize interest on liabilities for uncertain tax positions in interest expense and would recognize penalties, if any, in operating expenses in the Companies’ consolidated income statements. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Companies recognized an immaterial amount of interest expense and no penalties for uncertain tax positions in their consolidated income statements. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Companies recognized an immaterial amount of accrued interest on their consolidated balance sheets.\nIn February 2024, New York State completed its examination of the Companies' New York State income and franchise tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2021 with no changes. \nCon Edison’s federal tax return for 2023 remains under examination.

See Note X.\n(c)    On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X.\nRevenues are recorded as energy is delivered, generated or services are provided and billed to customers, except for services under percentage-of-completion contracts. Amounts billed are recorded in accounts receivable - customers, with payment generally due the following month. Con Edison’s and the Utilities’ accounts receivable - customers balance also reflects the Utilities’ purchase of receivables from energy service companies to support retail choice programs. Accrued revenues not yet billed to customers are recorded as accrued unbilled revenues.\nThe Utilities have the obligation to deliver electricity, gas and steam energy to their customers. As the energy is immediately available for use upon delivery to the customer, the energy and its delivery are identifiable as a single performance obligation. The Utilities recognize revenues as this performance obligation is satisfied over time as the Utilities deliver, and the customers simultaneously receive and consume, the energy. The amount of revenues recognized reflects the consideration the Utilities expect to receive in exchange for delivering the energy. Under their tariffs, the transaction price for full-service customers includes the Utilities’ energy cost and for all customers includes delivery charges determined based on customer class and in accordance with established tariffs and guidelines of the NYSPSC or the NJBPU, as applicable. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with these customers. The transaction price is applied to the Utilities’ revenue generating activities through the customer billing process. Because energy is delivered over time, the Utilities use output methods that recognize revenue based on direct measurement of the value transferred, such as units delivered, which provides an accurate measure of value for the energy delivered. The Utilities accrue revenues at the end of each month for estimated energy delivered but not yet billed to customers. The Utilities defer over a 12-month period net interruptible gas revenues, other than those authorized by the NYSPSC to be retained by the Utilities, for refund to firm gas sales and transportation customers. \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n157\n                      \nThe Clean Energy Businesses recognized revenue for the sale of energy from renewable electric projects as energy was generated and billed to counterparties; accrued revenues at the end of each month for energy generated but not yet billed to counterparties; and recognized revenue as energy was delivered and services were provided for managing energy supply assets leased from others and managing the dispatch, fuel requirements and risk management activities for generating plants and merchant transmission in the northeastern United States. The Clean Energy Businesses also recognized revenue for providing energy-efficiency services to government and commercial customers, and recognized revenue for engineering, procurement and construction services, under the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X. \nUse of the Percentage-of-Completion Method\nSales and profits on each percentage-of-completion contract at the Clean Energy Businesses were recorded each month based on the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less cumulative revenues recognized in prior periods (the ‘‘cost-to-cost’’ method). The impact of revisions of contract estimates, which may have resulted from contract modifications, performance or other reasons, were recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions were made. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses.

Substantially all accrued unbilled contract revenue is expected to be collected within one year. Unbilled contract revenue arises from the cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition. Unbilled contract revenue from fixed-price type contracts is converted to billed receivables when amounts are invoiced to customers according to contractual billing terms, which generally occur when deliveries or other performance milestones are completed.\n(b)\nUnearned revenue represents a liability for billings to customers in excess of earned revenue, which are contract liabilities as defined in Topic 606.\n(c)\nAdditions for unbilled contract revenue and subtractions for unearned revenue represent additional revenue earned. Additions for unearned revenue and subtractions for unbilled contract revenue represent billings. Activity also includes appropriate balance sheet classification for the period. Of the subtractions in 2023, $21 million and $1 million relate to the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses for unbilled contract revenue and unearned revenue, respectively. See (e) below.\n(d)\nOf the subtractions from unearned revenue, $\n3\n million and $\n4\n million were included in the balances as of January 1, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(e)\nFollowing the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses, Con Edison received substantially all contract revenue, net of certain costs incurred, for a battery storage project located in Imperial County, California. See Note W.\n \nNote N – \nCurrent Expected Credit Losses\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nThe Utilities’ “Account receivable – customers” balance consists of utility bills due (bills are generally due the month following billing) from customers who have energy delivered, generated, or services provided by the Utilities. The balance also reflects the Utilities’ purchase of receivables from energy service companies to support the retail choice programs.\nThe “Other receivables” balance generally reflects costs billed by the Utilities for goods and services provided to external parties, such as accommodation work for private parties and certain governmental entities, real estate rental and pole attachments. \n158\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nOn March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X. The Clean Energy Businesses’ customer accounts receivable balance generally reflected the management of energy supply assets, energy-efficiency services to government and commercial customers, and the engineering, procurement, and construction services of renewable energy projects. The Clean Energy Businesses calculated an allowance for uncollectible accounts related to their energy services customers based on an aging and customer-specific analysis. The amount of such reserves was not material at December 31, 2022.  The Clean Energy Businesses were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022. \nThe Companies develop expected loss estimates using past events data and consider current conditions and future reasonable and supportable forecasts. Changes to the Utilities’ reserve balances that result in write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances above existing rate allowances are not reflected in rates during the term of the current rate plans. For the Utilities’ allowance for uncollectible accounts for customer accounts receivable, which includes accrued unbilled revenue, past events considered include write-offs relative to customer accounts receivable; current conditions include macro-and micro-economic conditions related to trends in the local economy, bankruptcy rates and current and aged customer accounts receivable balances, including final balances, among other factors; and forecasts about the future include assumptions related to the level of write-offs and recoveries. During 2024, Con Edison's and CECONY's allowances for uncollectible accounts increased to $\n620\n million and $\n605\n million, respectively. Generally, the Utilities write off customer accounts receivable as uncollectible \n90\n days after the account is disconnected for non-payment, or the account is closed during the collection process. \nOther receivables allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated based on a historical average of collections relative to total other receivables, including current receivables. Current macro- and micro-economic conditions are also considered when calculating the current reserve. Probable outcomes of pending litigation, whether favorable or unfavorable to the Companies, are also included in the consideration. \nCustomer accounts receivable and the associated allowance for uncollectible accounts are included in the line “Accounts receivable – customers” on the Companies’ consolidated balance sheets. Other receivables and the associated allowance for uncollectible accounts are included in “Other receivables” on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe table below presents a rollforward by major portfolio segment type for the years ended December 31, 2024,  2023 and 2022:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nCon Edison\nCECONY\nAccounts receivable - customers\nOther receivables\nAccounts receivable - customers\nOther receivables\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAllowance for credit losses\nBeginning Balance at January 1,\n$\n360\n$\n322\n$\n317\n$\n13\n$\n10\n$\n22\n$\n353\n$\n314\n$\n304\n$\n9\n$\n7\n$\n19\nRecoveries\n21\n14\n17\n—\n—\n—\n17\n12\n16\n—\n—\n—\nWrite-offs\n(\n250\n)\n(\n138\n)\n(\n103\n)\n—\n(\n5\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n239\n)\n(\n131\n)\n(\n94\n)\n—\n(\n3\n)\n(\n4\n)\nReserve adjustments\n489\n162\n91\n28\n8\n(\n6\n)\n474\n158\n88\n29\n5\n(\n8\n)\nEnding Balance December 31, \n$\n620\n$\n360\n$\n322\n$\n41\n$\n13\n$\n10\n$\n605\n$\n353\n$\n314\n$\n38\n$\n9\n$\n7\nNote O – \nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Companies may compensate employees and directors with, among other things, stock units, restricted stock units, contributions to the stock purchase plan and stock options. Long Term Incentive Plans that were approved by Con Edison’s shareholders in 2003 (2003 LTIP), 2013 (2013 LTIP), and 2023 (2023 LTIP) are collectively referred to herein as the LTIP. The LTIP provides for, among other things, awards to employees of restricted stock units and stock options and, to Con Edison’s non-employee directors, stock units. Existing awards under the 2003 LTIP and \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n159\n                      \nthe 2013 LTIP continue in effect, however no new awards may be issued under either plan. The 2023 LTIP provides for awards for up to \nten million\n shares of common stock.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, equity awards were granted under the 2013 and 2023 LTIP. Shares of Con Edison common stock used to satisfy the Companies’ obligations with respect to stock-based compensation may be new shares (authorized, but unissued) or treasury shares (existing treasury shares or shares purchased in the open market). The shares used during the year ended December 31, 2024 were new shares. The Companies intend to use new shares to fulfill their stock-based compensation obligations for 2025.\nThe Companies recognized stock-based compensation expense using a fair value measurement method. \nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense recognized by the Companies in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n  \nCon Edison\nCECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPerformance-based restricted stock\n$\n23\n$\n41\n$\n52\n$\n20\n$\n36\n$\n43\nTime-based restricted stock\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nNon-employee director deferred stock compensation\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nStock purchase plan\n7\n7\n7\n7\n7\n6\nTotal\n$\n35\n$\n53\n$\n64\n$\n32\n$\n48\n$\n54\nIncome tax benefit\n$\n10\n$\n15\n$\n18\n$\n9\n$\n13\n$\n15\nRestricted Stock and Stock Units\nRestricted stock and stock unit awards under the LTIP have been made as follows: (i) awards that provide for adjustment of the number of units (performance-restricted stock units or Performance RSUs) to certain officers and employees; (ii) time-based awards to certain officers and employees; and (iii) awards to non-employee directors. Restricted stock and stock units awarded represent the right to receive, upon vesting, shares of Con Edison common stock, or, except for units awarded under the directors’ plan, the cash value of shares or a combination thereof.\nThe number of units in each annual Performance RSU award is subject to adjustment as follows: (i) \n50\n percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from \n0\n to \n200\n percent, based on Con Edison’s total shareholder return relative to a specified peer group during a specified performance period (the TSR portion); and (ii) \n50\n percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by factors that may range from \n0\n to \n200\n percent, based on determinations made in connection with the Companies’ annual incentive plans or, with respect to certain executive officers, actual performance as compared to certain performance measures during a specified performance period (the non-TSR portion). Performance RSU awards generally vest upon completion of the performance period.\nPerformance against the established targets is recomputed each reporting period as of the earlier of the reporting date and the vesting date. The TSR portion applies a Monte Carlo simulation model, and the non-TSR portion is the product of the market price at the end of the period and the average non-TSR determination over the vesting period. Performance RSUs are “liability awards” because each Performance RSU represents the right to receive, upon vesting, \none\n share of Con Edison common stock, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof. As such, changes in the fair value of the Performance RSUs are reflected in net income. \nThe assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the awards were as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRisk-free interest rate (a)\n4.23\n% - \n4.25\n%\n4.06\n% - \n4.64\n%\n4.41\n% -\n4.73\n%\nExpected term (b)\n3\n years\n3\n years\n3\n years\nExpected share price volatility (c)\n16.48\n% - \n17.20\n%\n17.88\n% - \n19.92\n%\n19.65\n% - \n21.77\n%\n(a)\nThe risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve.\n(b)\nThe expected term of the Performance RSUs equals the vesting period. The Companies do not expect significant forfeitures to occur.\n(c)\nBased on historical experience. The Companies would reevaluate this assumption if market conditions or business developments would reasonably indicate that future volatility might differ materially from historical experience.\nA summary of changes in the status of the Performance RSUs’ TSR and non-TSR portions during the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:\n160\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nCon Edison\nCECONY\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (a)\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (a)\nUnits\nTSR\nPortion (b)\nNon-TSR\nPortion (c)\nUnits\nTSR\nPortion (b)\nNon-TSR\nPortion (c)\nNon-vested at December 31, 2023\n838,303\n$\n83.70\n$\n80.40\n638,473\n$\n83.94\n$\n80.97\nGranted\n296,250\n88.25\n88.03\n246,221\n87.96\n88.17\nVested\n(\n365,756\n)\n74.36\n71.12\n(\n272,859\n)\n74.10\n71.36\nForfeited \n(\n47,996\n)\n88.48\n85.20\n(\n38,242\n)\n88.78\n85.73\nTransferred \n—\n—\n—\n(\n12,186\n)\n$\n90.81\n$\n86.84\nNon-vested at December 31, 2024\n720,801\n$\n89.99\n$\n87.93\n561,407\n$\n90.01\n$\n88.35\n(a)\nThe TSR and non-TSR Portions each account for \n50\n percent of the awards’ value.\n(b)\nFair value is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation described above.

The market price has not been discounted to reflect that dividends do not accrue and are not payable on Performance RSUs until vesting.\n(d)\nRepresents allocation to another Con Edison subsidiary of a portion of the Performance RSUs that had been awarded to a CECONY officer who transferred to another subsidiary.\n \nThe total expense to be recognized by Con Edison in future periods for unvested Performance RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2024 is $\n15\n million, including $\n14\n million for CECONY, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \none year\n for both Con Edison and CECONY. Con Edison and CECONY paid cash of $\n30\n million and $\n27\n million in 2024, $\n21\n million and $\n19\n million in 2023, and $\n10\n million and $\n9\n million in 2022, respectively, to settle vested Performance RSUs. \nIn accordance with the accounting rules for stock compensation, for time-based awards awarded to employees, the Companies accrue a liability and recognize compensation expense based on the market value of a common share throughout the vesting period. The vesting period for awards is \nthree years\n and is based on the employee’s continuous service to Con Edison. Prior to vesting, the awards are subject to forfeiture in whole or in part under certain circumstances. The awards are “liability awards” because each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con Edison common stock, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof. As such, prior to vesting, changes in the fair value of the units are reflected in net income.\nThe time-based awards awarded to officers are “equity awards” because each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con Edison common stock with no cash value options. As such, in accordance with the accounting rules for stock compensation, the value of the awards is measured at the estimated fair value on the date of grant. The cost is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. The vesting period for awards is three years and is based on each officer’s continuous service to Con Edison.\nA summary of changes in the status of time-based awards during the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:\nCon Edison\nCECONY\nUnits\nWeighted Average Grant Date\nFair Value\nUnits\nWeighted Average Grant Date \nFair Value\nNon-vested at December 31, 2023\n345,201\n$\n89.71\n289,063\n$\n90.25\nGranted\n200,550\n88.60\n173,755\n88.72\nVested\n(\n14,915\n)\n74.80\n(\n14,015\n)\n74.80\nForfeited\n(\n22,766\n)\n87.67\n(\n18,938\n)\n87.86\nTransferred\n—\n—\n(\n5,210\n)\n86.84\nNon-vested at December 31, 2024\n508,070\n$\n89.80\n424,655\n$\n90.28\nThe total expense to be recognized by Con Edison in future periods for unvested time-based awards outstanding at December 31, 2024 is $\n18\n million, including $\n16\n million for CECONY, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \ntwo years\n. Con Edison and CECONY paid cash of $\n2\n million in 2024 and $\n2\n million in 2023 and 2022, to settle vested time-based awards.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n161\n                      \nUnder the LTIP, each non-employee director receives stock units, which are deferred until the director’s separation from service or another date specified by the director. Each director may also elect to defer all or a portion of their cash compensation into additional stock units, which are deferred until the director’s termination of service or another date specified by the director. Non-employee directors’ stock units issued under the LTIP are considered “equity awards,” because they may only be settled in shares. Directors immediately vest in units issued to them. The fair value of the units is determined using the closing price of Con Edison’s common stock on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue. In the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately \n33,000\n units were issued at a weighted average grant date price of $\n89.23\n.\nStock Purchase Plan\nThe Stock Purchase Plans, which were approved by shareholders in 2014 and 2024 (collectively, the Plan), provide for the Companies to contribute up to $\n1\n for each $\n9\n invested by their directors, officers or employees to purchase Con Edison common stock under the Plan. Eligible participants may invest up to $\n25,000\n during any calendar year (subject to an additional limitation for officers and employees of not more than \n20\n percent of their pay). Dividends paid on shares held under the Plan are reinvested in additional shares unless otherwise directed by the participant.\nParticipants in the Plan immediately vest in shares purchased by them under the Plan. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, \n774,338\n, \n751,702\n and \n744,932\n shares were purchased under the Plan at a weighted average price of $\n94.71\n, $\n91.80\n and $\n91.59\n per share, respectively.\n162\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nNote P – \nFinancial Information by Business Segment\nIn December 2024, the Companies adopted ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The amendments improve the disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and address requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. Prior periods presented have been updated to conform to the requirements of the ASU.\nThe business segments of each of the Companies, which are its operating segments, were determined based on management’s reporting and decision-making requirements in accordance with the accounting rules for segment reporting. Con Edison’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) is the Con Edison President and Chief Executive Officer, and CECONY’s CODMs are the CECONY Chief Executive Officer and the CECONY President. Con Edison's CODM is regularly provided with each company’s operating income to assess performance and allocate resources, including drivers of budget variances by regulated utility service for the Utilities, and for the nonregulated entities. CECONY’s CODMs are regularly provided with CECONY’s operating income to assess performance and allocate resources, including drivers of budget variances by CECONY's principal business segments.\nCon Edison’s principal business segments are CECONY’s regulated utility activities, O&R’s regulated utility activities and Con Edison Transmission. CECONY’s principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. \nAll revenues of these business segments are from customers located in the United States of America. Also, all assets of the business segments are located in the United States of America. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note A.\nCommon services shared by the business segments are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors,

See Note W and Note X.\n(b)\nOther includes the parent company, Con Edison’s tax equity investments, consolidation adjustments and Broken Bow II, the deferred project held for sale at December 31, 2024, the sale and transfer of which was completed in January 2025. \n(c)\nOther operations and maintenance expenses constitute significant segment expenses which are regularly provided to the CODMs. Other operating expense includes other segment items (purchased power, fuel, gas purchased for resale, taxes other than income taxes) and, for 2023, the preliminary gain on the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n165\n                      \nNote Q – \nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nCon Edison’s subsidiaries hedge market price fluctuations associated with physical purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas, steam and, to a lesser extent, refined fuels by using derivative instruments including futures, forwards, basis swaps, options, transmission congestion contracts and financial transmission rights contracts.  These are economic hedges, for which the Utilities do not elect hedge accounting. The Companies use economic hedges to manage commodity price risk in accordance with provisions set by state regulators. The volume of hedging activity at the Utilities depends upon the forecasted volume of physical commodity supply to meet customer needs, and program costs or benefits are recovered from or credited to full-service customers, respectively. Derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value (see Note R), unless an exception is available under the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging. Qualifying derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts are not reported at fair value under the accounting rules. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X.\nThe fair values of the Companies’ derivatives, including the offsetting of assets and liabilities, on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were:\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\nBalance Sheet Location\nGross\nAmounts of\nRecognized\nAssets/\n(Liabilities)\nGross\nAmounts\nOffset\nNet Amounts of Assets/(Liabilities) (a)\nGross\nAmounts of\nRecognized\nAssets/\n(Liabilities)\nGross\nAmounts\nOffset\nNet Amounts of Assets/(Liabilities) (a)\nCon Edison\nFair value of derivative assets\nCurrent\n$\n56\n$(\n41\n)\n$\n15\n(b)\n$\n83\n$(\n38\n)\n$\n45\n(b)\nNoncurrent\n39\n \n(\n12\n)\n27\n77\n \n(\n29\n)\n48\n \nTotal fair value of derivative assets\n$\n95\n$(\n53\n)\n$\n42\n$\n160\n$(\n67\n)\n$\n93\nFair value of derivative liabilities\nCurrent\n$(\n92\n)\n$\n44\n$(\n48\n)\n(b)\n$(\n230\n)\n$\n52\n$(\n178\n)\n(b)\nNoncurrent \n(\n108\n)\n12\n(\n96\n)\n(\n154\n)\n33\n(\n121\n)\nTotal fair value of derivative liabilities\n$(\n200\n)\n$\n56\n$(\n144\n)\n$(\n384\n)\n$\n85\n$(\n299\n)\nNet fair value derivative assets/(liabilities)\n$(\n105\n)\n$\n3\n$(\n102\n)\n$(\n224\n)\n$\n18\n$(\n206\n)\nCECONY\nFair value of derivative assets\nCurrent\n$\n51\n$(\n40\n)\n$\n11\n(b)\n$\n78\n$(\n35\n)\n$\n43\n(b)\nNoncurrent\n36\n(\n11\n)\n25\n76\n(\n27\n)\n49\nTotal fair value of derivative assets\n$\n87\n$(\n51\n)\n$\n36\n$\n154\n$(\n62\n)\n$\n92\nFair value of derivative liabilities\nCurrent\n$(\n84\n)\n$\n42\n$(\n42\n)\n(b)\n$(\n217\n)\n$\n48\n$(\n169\n)\n(b)\nNoncurrent\n(\n95\n)\n11\n(\n84\n)\n(\n139\n)\n31\n(\n108\n)\nTotal fair value of derivative liabilities\n$(\n179\n)\n$\n53\n$(\n126\n)\n$(\n356\n)\n$\n79\n$(\n277\n)\nNet fair value derivative assets/(liabilities)\n$(\n92\n)\n$\n2\n \n$(\n90\n)\n$(\n202\n)\n$\n17\n$(\n185\n)\n \n(a)\nDerivative instruments and collateral were offset on the consolidated balance sheet as applicable under the accounting rules. The Companies enter into master agreements for their commodity derivatives. These agreements typically provide offset in the event of contract termination. In such case, generally the non-defaulting party’s payable will be offset by the defaulting party’s payable. The non-defaulting party will customarily notify the defaulting party within a specific time period and come to an agreement on the early termination amount.\n(b)\nAt December 31, 2024, no margin deposits for Con Edison and CECONY were classified as derivative assets and $(\n4\n) million and $(\n2\n) million, respectively were classified as derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, but not included in the table. At December 31, 2023, margin deposits for Con Edison and CECONY of $\n7\n million and $\n6\n million were classified as derivative assets, and $(\n15\n) million and $(\n10\n) million, respectively were classified as derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, but not included in the table. Margin is collateral, typically cash, that the holder of a derivative instrument is required to deposit in order to transact on an exchange and to cover its potential losses with its broker or the exchange.\nThe Utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state utility regulators. In accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations, the Utilities record a regulatory asset or regulatory liability to defer recognition of unrealized gains and losses on their electric and gas derivatives. As gains and losses are realized in \n166\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nfuture periods, they will be recognized as purchased power, gas and fuel costs in the Companies’ consolidated income statements.\nThe Clean Energy Businesses recorded realized and unrealized gains and losses on their derivative contracts in gas purchased for resale and non-utility revenue in the reporting period in which they occurred. The Clean Energy Businesses recorded changes in the fair value of their interest rate swaps in other interest expense at the end of each reporting period. Management believes that these derivative instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses.

Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty’s nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements, collateral or prepayment arrangements, credit insurance and credit default swaps. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the Companies have a legally enforceable right to offset.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n167\n                      \nAt December 31, 2024, Con Edison and CECONY had $\n29\n million and $\n21\n million of credit exposure, respectively, in connection with open energy supply net receivables and hedging activities, net of collateral. Con Edison’s net credit exposure consisted of $\n22\n million with investment-grade counterparties and $\n7\n million with commodity exchange brokers. CECONY’s net credit exposure consisted of $\n15\n million with investment-grade counterparties and $\n6\n million with commodity exchange brokers.\nThe collateral requirements associated with, and settlement of, derivative transactions are included in net cash flows from operating activities in the Companies’ consolidated statements of cash flows. Most derivative instrument contracts contain provisions that may require a party to provide collateral on its derivative instruments that are in a net liability position. The amount of collateral to be provided will depend on the fair value of the derivative instruments and the party’s credit ratings.\nThe following table presents the aggregate fair value of the Companies’ derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position, the collateral posted for such positions and the additional collateral that would have been required to be posted had the lowest applicable credit rating been reduced one level and to below investment grade at December 31, 2024:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCon Edison (a)\nCECONY (a)\nAggregate fair value – net liabilities\n$\n129\n$\n112\nCollateral posted\n122\n120\nAdditional collateral (b) (downgrade one level from current ratings)\n17\n8\nAdditional collateral (b)(c) (downgrade to below investment grade from current ratings)\n136\n114\n \n(a)\nNon-derivative transactions for the purchase and sale of electricity and gas and qualifying derivative instruments, that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales, are excluded from the table. These transactions primarily include purchases of electricity from independent system operators. In the event the Utilities are no longer extended unsecured credit for such purchases, the Companies would be required to post additional collateral of $\n1\n million at December 31, 2024. For certain other such non-derivative transactions, the Companies could be required to post collateral under certain circumstances, including in the event counterparties had reasonable grounds for insecurity. \n(b)\nThe Companies measure the collateral requirements by taking into consideration the fair value amounts of derivative instruments that contain credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position plus amounts owed to counterparties for settled transactions and amounts required by counterparties for minimum financial security. The fair value amounts represent unrealized losses, net of any unrealized gains where the Companies have a legally enforceable right to offset.\n(c)\nDerivative instruments that are net assets have been excluded from the table. At December 31, 2024, if Con Edison had been downgraded to below investment grade, it would have been required to post additional collateral for such derivative instruments of $\n8\n million.\nNote R – \nFair Value Measurements\nThe accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, that refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable firm inputs. The Companies often make certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques. The Companies use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures established a fair value hierarchy, that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels. The rules require that assets and liabilities be classified in their entirety based on the level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assessing the significance of a particular input may require judgment considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Companies classify fair value balances based on the fair value hierarchy defined by the accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 – Consists of assets or liabilities whose value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date. An active market is one in which transactions for assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. This category includes \n168\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\ncontracts traded on active exchange markets valued using unadjusted prices quoted directly from the exchange.\n•\nLevel 2 – Consists of assets or liabilities valued using industry standard models and based on prices, other than quoted prices within Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. The industry standard models consider observable assumptions including time value, volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the underlying commodities, in addition to other economic measures. This category includes contracts traded on active exchanges or in over-the-counter markets priced with industry standard models.\n•\nLevel 3 – Consists of assets or liabilities whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that are generally less readily observable and supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best available information and subject to cost benefit constraints. This category includes contracts priced using models that are internally developed and contracts placed in illiquid markets. It also includes contracts that expire after the period of time for which quoted prices are available and internal models are used to determine a significant portion of the value.\nFor information on the measurement of Con Edison's investment in MVP that was measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, see Note A.

Transfers out of Level 3 represent assets and liabilities that were previously classified as Level 3 for which the inputs became observable for classification in Level 2. The inputs are now observable because of availability of observable market data due to the decrease in the terms of certain contracts from beyond three years to less than three years.  \n(b)\nLevel 2 assets and liabilities include investments held in the deferred compensation plan and/or non-qualified retirement plans, exchange-traded contracts where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1, and certain over-the-counter derivative instruments for electricity, refined products and natural gas. Derivative instruments classified as Level 2 are valued using industry standard models that incorporate corroborated observable inputs, such as pricing services or prices from similar instruments that trade in liquid markets, time value and volatility factors.\n(c)\nThe accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures require consideration of the impact of nonperformance risk (including credit risk) from a market participant perspective in the measurement of the fair value of assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Companies determined that nonperformance risk would have no material impact on their financial position or results of operations.\n(d)\nAmounts represent the impact of legally-enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Companies to net gain and loss positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.\nThe employees in the Companies’ risk management group develop and maintain the Companies’ valuation policies and procedures for, and verify pricing and fair value valuation of, commodity derivatives. Under the Companies’ \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n169\n                      \npolicies and procedures, multiple independent sources of information are obtained for forward price curves used to value commodity derivatives. Fair value and changes in fair value of commodity derivatives are reported monthly to the Companies’ risk committees, comprised of officers and employees of the Companies that oversee energy hedging at the Utilities. The risk management group reports to the Companies’ Vice President and Treasurer.\nFair Value of Level 3 at December 31, 2024\nAverage \nMarket Price\n(Millions of Dollars)\nValuation Techniques\nUnobservable Inputs\nRange\nCon Edison \n—  \nCommodity\nElectricity\n$(\n16\n)\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward capacity prices ($/kW-month) (a)\n$\n0.73\n - $\n7.14\n$\n3.69\nTransmission Congestion Contracts\n1\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nInter-zonal forward price curves adjusted for historical zonal losses ($/MWh)  (b)\n$(\n0.20\n) - $\n3.88\n$\n1.85\nTotal Con Edison - Commodity\n$(\n15\n)\nCECONY — Commodity\nElectricity\n$(\n7\n)\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward capacity prices ($/kW-month) (a)\n$\n0.73\n - $\n7.14\n$\n3.75\nTransmission Congestion Contracts\n1\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nInter-zonal forward price curves adjusted for historical zonal losses ($/MWh) (b)\n$(\n0.20\n) - $\n3.88\n$\n1.85\nTotal CECONY — Commodity\n$(\n6\n)\n \n(a)\nGenerally, increases/(decreases) in this input in isolation would result in a higher/(lower) fair value measurement.\n(b)\nGenerally, increases/(decreases) in this input in isolation would result in a lower/(higher) fair value measurement.\nThe table listed below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending net balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy:\n \n                 Con Edison\n                 CECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nBeginning balance as of January 1,\n$(\n8\n)\n$\n15\n$(\n5\n)\n$(\n6\n)\nIncluded in earnings\n(\n9\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n2\n)\nIncluded in regulatory assets and liabilities\n(\n7\n)\n33\n—\n31\nSettlements\n10\n4\n4\n2\nDecrease due to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses (a)\n—\n(\n29\n)\n—\n—\nTransfer out of level 3\n(\n1\n)\n(\n27\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n30\n)\nEnding balance as of December 31,\n$(\n15\n)\n$(\n8\n)\n$(\n6\n)\n$(\n5\n)\n(a)\nOn March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses.

The Utilities generally recover these costs in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utilities regulators. See Note A. Unrealized gains and losses for commodity derivatives are generally deferred on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations.\nFor the Clean Energy Businesses, realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities were reported in \nnon-utility revenues\n ($\n17\n million loss and $\n26\n million gain) on the consolidated income statement for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses and amounts for 2023 are shown through the date of sale. See Note W and Note X.\n170\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nNote S – \nVariable Interest Entities\nThe accounting rules for consolidation address the consolidation of a variable interest entity (VIE) by a business enterprise that is the primary beneficiary. A VIE is an entity that does not have a sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the business enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and either absorbs a significant amount of the VIE’s losses or has the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE.\nThe Companies enter into arrangements including leases, partnerships and electricity purchase agreements, with various entities. As a result of these arrangements, the Companies retain or may retain a variable interest in these entities.\nCECONY\nCECONY has an ongoing long-term electricity purchase agreement with Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partn\ners, LP, a potential VIE. In 2024, a request was made of this counterparty for information necessary to determine whether the entity was a VIE and whether CECONY is the primary beneficiary; however, the information was not made available. See \nNote I for information on this electricity purchase agreement; the payments for this contract constitute CECONY's maximum exposure to loss with respect to the potential VIE.\nClean Energy Businesses\nCon Edison has determined that the use of Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) accounting is reasonable and appropriate to attribute income and loss to the tax equity investors for various projects owned by the Clean Energy Businesses. See \"Use of Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value\" in Note A. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. In connection with the sale, Con Edison retained a tax equity interest in \ntwo\n renewable electric projects located in Virginia, and in the Crane Solar Project (collectively, the \"Retained Projects\"). Included in the sale were Con Edison's interests in CED Nevada Virginia and the Tax Equity Projects, defined below (collectively, the \"Sold Projects\"). The HLBV method of accounting resulted in an immaterial amount of income/(loss) for Con Edison and the tax equity investor for the Sold Projects for the year ended December 31, 2023; information for the year ended December 31, 2022 is presented below. See Note W and X.\nRetained Projects \nCon Edison retained a tax equity interest in \ntwo\n renewable electric projects located in Virginia that is accounted for as an equity method investment and represents the maximum exposure to loss for this investment. See Note A and Note W. The earnings of the projects are determined using the HLBV method of accounting and resulted in losses of $\n3\n million ($\n2.5\n million, after tax) and $\n14\n million ($\n10\n million, after tax) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCon Edison also retained its equity interest in the Crane solar project that was valued at $\n0\n as of December 31, 2024 and is accounted for as an equity method investment. See Note W. The earnings of the project are determined using the HLBV method of accounting and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nCon Edison is not the primary beneficiary of any Retained Projects since the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the renewable electric projects is not held by Con Edison.\nSold Projects \nIn 2018, the Clean Energy Businesses completed its acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. Included in the acquisition were certain operating projects (Tax Equity Projects) with a noncontrolling tax equity investor to which a percentage of earnings, tax attributes and cash flows are allocated. Electricity generated by the Tax Equity Projects is sold to utilities and municipalities pursuant to long-term power purchase agreements. \nIn 2021, a subsidiary of the Clean Energy Businesses entered into an agreement relating to certain projects (CED Nevada Virginia) with a noncontrolling tax equity investor to which a percentage of earnings, tax attributes and cash flows are allocated. \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n171\n                      \nThe Tax Equity Projects and CED Nevada Virginia were consolidated entities in which Con Edison had less than a \n100\n percent membership interest at December 31, 2022 and in which Con Edison has no interest in subsequent to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses on March 1, 2023. Con Edison was the primary beneficiary since the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the Tax Equity Projects and CED Nevada Virginia was held by Con Edison.\nOn March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X. \nThe HLBV method of accounting resulted in income/(loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCED Nevada Virginia\nTax Equity Projects\nTax equity investor\n$(\n49\n)\n$(\n11\n)\n   After tax\n(\n37\n)\n(\n8\n)\nCon Edison\n41\n51\n   After tax\n31\n38\nNote T – \nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Companies recognize a liability at fair value for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets in the period in which they are incurred, or when sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the fair value of such legal obligations. When the liability is initially recorded, asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The fair value of the asset retirement obligation liability is measured using expected future cash flows discounted at credit-adjusted risk-free rates, historical information, and where available, quoted prices from outside contractors. The Companies evaluate these assumptions underlying the asset retirement obligation liability on an annual basis or as frequently as needed.\nThe Companies recorded asset retirement obligations associated with the removal of asbestos and asbestos-containing material in their buildings (other than the structures enclosing generating stations and substations), electric equipment and steam and gas distribution systems. The Companies also recorded asset retirement obligations relating to gas and oil pipelines abandoned in place and municipal infrastructure support.\nThe Companies did not record an asset retirement obligation for the removal of asbestos associated with the structures enclosing generating stations and substations. For these building structures, the Companies were unable to reasonably estimate their asset retirement obligations because the Companies were unable to estimate the undiscounted retirement costs or the retirement dates and settlement dates. The amount of the undiscounted retirement costs could vary considerably depending on the disposition method for the building structures, and the method has not been determined. The Companies anticipate continuing to use these building structures in their businesses for an indefinite period, and so the retirement dates and settlement dates are not determinable.\nCon Edison recorded asset retirement obligations for the removal of the Clean Energy Businesses’ solar and wind equipment related to projects located on property that is not owned by them and the term of the arrangement is finite including any renewal options. Con Edison did not record asset retirement obligations for the Clean Energy Businesses’ projects that were located on property that was owned by them because they expect that the equipment will continue to generate electricity at these facilities long past the manufacturer’s warranty at minimal operating expense. Therefore, Con Edison was unable to reasonably estimate the retirement date of this equipment. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X.\nThe Utilities include in depreciation rates the estimated removal costs, less salvage, for utility plant assets. The amounts related to removal costs that are associated with asset retirement obligations are classified as an asset retirement liability. Pursuant to accounting rules for regulated operations, future removal costs that do not represent legal asset retirement obligations are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Accretion and depreciation expenses related \n172\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nto removal costs that represent legal asset retirement obligations are applied against the Companies’ regulatory liabilities. Asset retirement costs that are recoverable from customers are recorded as regulatory liabilities to reflect the timing difference between costs recovered through the rate-making process and recognition of costs.\nThe following table represents the balance of asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and changes to the obligation for the years then ended:\nCon Edison\nCECONY\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n(a)\n2023\n2024\n2023\nBeginning Balance as of January 1,\n$\n522\n$\n500\n$\n520\n$\n499\nChanges in estimated cash flows\n(\n21\n)\n76\n(\n21\n)\n75\nAccretion expense\n20\n17\n20\n17\nLiabilities settled\n(\n68\n)\n(\n71\n)\n(\n67\n)\n(\n71\n)\nEnding Balance as of December 31, (b)\n$\n453\n$\n522\n$\n452\n$\n520\n(a)\nThe asset retirement obligations of Broken Bow II in 2023 and 2024 are reflected in current liabilities held for sale on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. For 2023 and 2024, $\n3\n million of asset retirement obligations related to Broken Bow II are not shown in the table above, as they are already excluded from the beginning balance as of January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024 for Con Edison. Broken Bow II was sold and transferred in January 2025. See Note A, Note W, and Note X.\n(b)\nAt December 31, 2024, Con Edison and CECONY recorded reductions of $\n85\n million and $\n84\n million, respectively, to the regulatory liability associated with cost of removal to reflect depreciation and interest expense. At December 31, 2023, Con Edison and CECONY recorded reductions of $\n77\n million to the regulatory liability associated with cost of removal to reflect depreciation and interest expense.\nNote U – \nRelated Party Transactions\nThe NYSPSC generally requires that the Utilities and Con Edison’s other subsidiaries be operated as separate entities. The Utilities and the other subsidiaries are required to have separate operating employees and operating officers of the Utilities may not be operating officers of the other subsidiaries. The Utilities may provide administrative and other services to, and receive such services from, Con Edison and its other subsidiaries only pursuant to cost allocation procedures approved by the NYSPSC. Transfers of assets between the Utilities and Con Edison or its other subsidiaries may be made only as approved by the NYSPSC. The debt of the Utilities is to be raised directly by the Utilities and not derived from Con Edison. Without the prior permission of the NYSPSC, the Utilities may not make loans to, guarantee the obligations of, or pledge assets as security for the indebtedness of Con Edison or its other subsidiaries. The NYSPSC limits the dividends that the Utilities may pay Con Edison. See “Dividends” in Note C. As a result, substantially all of the net assets of CECONY and O&R ($\n19,971\n million and $\n1,142\n million, respectively), at December 31, 2024, are considered restricted net assets. The NYSPSC may impose additional measures to separate, or “ring fence,” the Utilities from Con Edison and its other subsidiaries. See “Rate Plans” in Note B.\nThe costs of administrative and other services provided by CECONY to, and received by it from, Con Edison and its other subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nCECONY (a)\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCost of services provided\n$\n147\n$\n146\n$\n135\nCost of services received\n82\n82\n75\n(a)  On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X.\nIn addition, CECONY and O&R have joint gas supply arrangements in connection with which CECONY sold to O&R $\n77\n million, $\n82\n million and $\n144\n million of natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts are net of the effect of related hedging transactions.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, CECONY's net receivable from Con Edison for income taxes were $\n344\n million and $\n110\n million, respectively.\nThe Utilities perform work and incur expenses on behalf of New York Transco, a company in which Con Edison Transmission owns an interest. The Utilities bill New York Transco for such work and expenses in accordance with \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n173\n                      \nestablished policies. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amounts billed by the Utilities to New York Transco were \nimmaterial\n and $\n7.3\n million, respectively.\nCECONY has a \n20\n-year transportation contract with MVP, a company in which Con Edison Transmission owns an interest, for \n200,000\n Dts per day of capacity. See \"Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP) \" in Note A. In October 2017, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resource Defense Council requested the NYSPSC to prohibit CECONY from recovering costs under its contract with MVP unless CECONY can demonstrate that the contract is in the public interest. CECONY advised the NYSPSC that it would respond to the request if the NYSPSC were to open a proceeding to consider this request. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the amounts billed by MVP to CECONY were $\n28\n million.\nFERC has authorized CECONY to lend funds to O&R for a period of not more than \n12\n months, in an amount not to exceed $\n250\n million, at prevailing market rates. At December 31, 2024 and 2023 there were \nno\n outstanding loans to O&R.\nThe Clean Energy Businesses had financial electric capacity contracts with CECONY and O&R. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. As a result of the sale, the Clean Energy Businesses are no longer recognized as a related party. See Note W and Note X.\nThe Consolidated Edison Foundation, Inc. (the Foundation), established in December 2023, is a non-consolidated not-for-profit corporation funded by Con Edison that makes contributions to selected charitable organizations. In December 2024, Con Edison made an unconditional promise to give $\n12\n million to the Foundation and accrued such amount as an expense in “Other Income and Deductions” within its consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2024. In April 2024, Con Edison made a contribution of $\n12\n million, that Con Edison accrued as an expense in “Other Income and Deductions” within its consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n \nNote V – \nNew Financial Accounting Standards\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) through ASU 2023-09 to improve disclosures related to income taxes. The amendments focus on three key areas: rate reconciliation, income taxes paid, and income (or loss)/income tax expense (or benefit) from disaggregated continuing operations. For public entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements. The Companies do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on their financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) to improve disclosures about a public business entity's expenses. The ASU addresses requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion) in commonly presented expense captions. The amendments require a public business entity to disclose, in the notes to the financial statements, specified information about certain costs and expenses at each interim and annual reporting period. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Companies are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the ASU on their financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nNote W – \nDispositions \nClean Energy Businesses\nDuring the first nine months of 2022, Con Edison considered strategic alternatives with respect to the Clean Energy Businesses. On October 1, 2022, following the conclusion of such review and to allow for continued focus on the Utilities and their clean energy transition, Con Edison entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which Con Edison agreed to sell all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses to RWE Renewables Americas, LLC, a subsidiary of RWE for a total of $\n6,800\n million, subject to closing adjustments. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses to RWE for $\n3,993\n million. The preliminary purchase price at the March 1, 2023 closing was adjusted (i) upward for certain cash and cash equivalents, (ii) downward for certain indebtedness and debt-like items, (iii) downward for certain transaction expenses, (iv) downward to the extent that the net working capital varied from a set target, (v) upward to the extent that capital expenditures incurred prior to the closing of the transaction varied from a set budget, and (vi) downward by the value allocated to Broken Bow II, a project that was not able to be conveyed to RWE upon closing of the \n174\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\ntransaction. The process to finalize the purchase price was completed during the second quarter of 2024. The final purchase price was subject to customary adjustments for timing differences and a final valuation report, among other factors. The transaction was completed at arm’s length and RWE was not, and will not be, considered a related party to Con Edison.\nThe sale on March 1, 2023 included all assets, operations and projects of the Clean Energy Businesses with the exception of tax equity interests in three projects, described below, that Con Edison continues to retain, and one deferred project, Broken Bow II, a \n75\n MW nameplate capacity wind power project located in Nebraska. See Note X. In January 2025, Con Edison completed the sale and transfer of Broken Bow II to RWE and the corresponding value of $\n54\n million (net of assumed debt and other final adjustments) was paid to Con Edison. RWE Renewables Americas, LLC operated the facility on behalf of Con Edison until the transfer to RWE pursuant to certain service agreements, for which the fees were not material.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Con Edison's preliminary gain on the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses was $\n865\n million ($\n767\n million, after tax). The portion of the gain attributable to the non-controlling interest retained in certain tax-equity projects was not material. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the gain on the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses was adjusted downward by $\n62\n million ($\n46\n million after-tax) in aggregate due to certain customary closing adjustments, including $\n33\n million ($\n25\n million after-tax) to align with the consideration received upon the sale and transfer of Broken Bow II in January 2025. See Note X. \nCon Edison retained the Clean Energy Businesses' tax equity investment interest in the Crane solar project and another tax equity investment interest in\n \ntwo\n \nsolar projects located in Virginia. These tax equity partnerships produced renewable energy tax credits that can be used to reduce Con Edison’s federal income tax. These tax credits are subject to recapture, in whole or in part, if the assets are sold within a\n \nfive\n-year\n period beginning on the date on which the assets are placed in service. Con Edison will continue to employ HLBV accounting for its interests in these tax equity partnerships. The combined carrying value of the retained tax equity interests was $\n4\n million and $\n13\n million at \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n.\nCon Edison also retained any post-sale deferred income taxes (federal and state income taxes, including tax attributes), any valuation allowances associated with the deferred tax assets, all current federal taxes and New York State taxes and the estimated liability for uncertain tax positions. The unamortized deferred investment tax credits of the Clean Energy Businesses were recognized in full upon the completion of the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. \nConcurrent with entering into the purchase and sale agreement, Con Edison incurred costs in the normal course of the sale process. Transaction costs of $\n48\n million ($\n35\n million after-tax),  $\n12\n million ($\n9\n million after-tax) and an \nimmaterial\n amount were recorded during 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Also, depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $\n41\n million ($\n28\n million after-tax) were not recorded on the assets of the Clean Energy Businesses in 2023 prior to the closing of the transaction. \nFollowing the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses and pursuant to a reimbursement and indemnity agreement with RWE, Con Edison remains responsible for certain potential costs related to a battery storage project located in Imperial County, California. Con Edison's exposure under the agreement could range up to approximate\nly $\n172\n million. As of December 31, 2024, no material amounts wer\ne recorded as liabilities on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet related to this agreement. \nDuring 2023, Con Edi\nson received $\n24\n million of net proceeds from this battery storage project. Con Edison had $\n4\n million of unbilled contract revenue recorded as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. See Note M. \nThe following table shows the pre-tax operating income for the Clean Energy Businesses. The 2023 period shown is through the date of the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses; there is no applicable data for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2023\n2022\nPre-tax operating income\n$\n25\n$\n466\nPre-tax operating income, excluding non-controlling interest\n21\n406\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n175\n                      \nNote X -\n Held-for-Sale Treatment of the Clean Energy Businesses\nOn March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W. The sale included all assets, operations and projects of the Clean Energy Businesses with the exception of tax equity interests in three projects and one deferred project, Broken Bow II, a \n75\n MW nameplate capacity wind power project located in Nebraska. In January 2025, Con Edison completed the sale and transfer of Broken Bow II to RWE and the corresponding value of $\n54\n million (net of assumed debt and other final adjustments) was paid to Con Edison. RWE Renewables Americas, LLC operated the facility on behalf of Con Edison until the transfer to RWE pursuant to certain service agreements, for which the fees were not material. Following the sale and transfer of Broken Bow II in January 2025, Con Edison did not have any assets or liabilities recorded on a held-for-sale basis.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the book value of the assets of Broken Bow II were reduced to align with the consideration received upon the transfer of the project in January 2025, resulting in a downward adjustment to the cumulative gain on the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses of $\n33\n million ($\n25\n million after-tax). See Note W.\nThe carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of Broken Bow II, that were transferred from Con Edison to RWE in January 2025, were presented on a held-for-sale basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2024\n, and accordingly, excluded net deferred tax liability balances, as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS\nCash and temporary cash investments\n$\n1\n$\n—\n Accounts receivable and other receivables  - net allowance for uncollectible accounts \n2\n1\nAccrued unbilled revenue\n—\n1\nRestricted cash\n8\n5\nOther current assets\n—\n1\nTOTAL CURRENT ASSETS\n11\n8\nNON-UTILITY PLANT\nNon-utility property, net accumulated depreciation\n59\n76\nNET PLANT\n59\n76\nOTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS\nIntangible assets, less accumulated amortization \n56\n72\nOperating lease right-of-use asset\n7\n7\nTOTAL OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS\n63\n79\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$\n133\n$\n163\n(Millions of Dollars)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nLIABILITIES\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nLong-term debt due within one year\n$\n2\n$\n2\nOperating lease liabilities \n2\n2\nOther current liabilities\n10\n4\nTOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES\n14\n8\nNONCURRENT LIABILITIES\nAsset retirement obligations\n3\n3\nOperating lease liabilities \n5\n5\nTOTAL NONCURRENT LIABILITIES\n8\n8\nLONG-TERM DEBT\n57\n60\nTOTAL LIABILITIES \n$\n79\n$\n76\n176\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n \nSchedule I\nCondensed Financial Information of Consolidated Edison, Inc.

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For each of the Companies, its management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, has concluded that the controls and procedures are effective to provide such reasonable assurance. Reasonable assurance is not absolute assurance, however, and there can be no assurance that any design of controls or procedures would be effective under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nFor the Companies’ Reports of Management On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the related opinions of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (presented in the Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm), see Item 8 of this report (which information is incorporated herein by reference).\nThere was no change in the Companies’ internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Companies’ most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companies’ internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B: Other Information\nSecurities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) \nadopted\n, \nterminated\n or modified any Rule 10b5-1 or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).\nCon Edison is disclosing the information below in this Item 9B in lieu of filing a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nAmendments to Con Edison’s By-laws\nOn February 20, 2025, the Board of Directors (the Board) of Con Edison approved and adopted amendments to Con Edison’s By-laws (as so amended, the By-laws), effective as of February 20, 2025. The amendments set forth in the By-laws include, among other things, the following:\n•\nallowing the Board to appoint one or more inspectors of election of shareholders’ vote, instead of the prior requirement of at least two but no more than five inspectors, and providing that if the appointed inspector(s) fail to appear or act, the Board may fill the vacancy in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the Chairman of the meeting (Section 6);\n•\nrequiring shareholders to provide reasonable evidence of compliance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than five business days prior to the applicable meeting of shareholders (Section 7);\n•\nreducing the required minimum number of directors on a Board committee from three members to two members (Section 10);\n•\nproviding for the Board’s delegation to the Chief Executive Officer of Con Edison to appoint and remove officer positions between annual appointments (excluding Executive Officers and the Controller, Treasurer, Secretary and General Auditor) (Section 12); and\n•\nincorporating other technical, ministerial, clarifying and conforming changes.\nThe foregoing description of the amendments to the By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-laws, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 3.1.2 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.\n180\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nItem 9C: Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections \nNot Applicable.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n181\n                      \nPart III\nItem 10: Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nItem 11: Executive Compensation\nItem 12: Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder\n \nMatters\nItem 13: Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nItem 14: Principal Accounting Fees and Services\nCon Edison\nInformation required by Part III as to Con Edison, other than the information required in Item 12 of this report by"
