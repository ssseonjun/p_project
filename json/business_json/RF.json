Cross references to more detailed information regarding each topic within MD&A and the consolidated financial statements are included. This summary is intended to assist in understanding the information provided, but should be read in conjunction with the entire MD&A and consolidated financial statements, as well as the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEconomic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets  \nAfter what is expected to be full-year 2024 growth of around 2.8 percent, Regions' baseline forecast anticipates real GDP growth of 2.2 percent in 2025. Though the economy grew at a robust pace in 2024, performance across individual sectors varied considerably. Interest rates rose over the latter part of 2024, reflecting persistent inflation pressures and uncertainty over looming policy changes. The Company's  baseline forecast anticipates real GDP growth settling back toward the pre-pandemic trend rate of growth over coming quarters. There is considerable uncertainty around any forecast for 2025 made before the specific details of changes to fiscal, trade, immigration, and regulatory policy are made known.\nThe pace of job growth slowed over the course of 2024 reflecting a slower pace of hiring amongst firms as opposed to a rising pace of layoffs. The combination of slowing job growth and rapid growth in the supply of labor pushed the unemployment rate higher in 2024. While Regions' forecast anticipates further moderation in the pace of job growth, it also anticipates much slower growth in the supply of labor, in part reflecting likely changes to immigration policy. These two factors should leave the unemployment rate relatively unchanged from where it ended 2024, with an expected annual average rate of 4.2 percent for 2025.\nDespite slowing job growth, aggregate labor earnings, the largest component of personal income, have continued to grow at a rate faster than inflation, which is expected to remain the case through 2025. This will continue to act as a support for consumer spending, and Regions' forecast anticipates growth in consumer spending will align more closely with growth in after-tax income than has been the case over the past few years. Nonetheless, the divide in spending patterns across the various income cohorts that has developed over recent quarters will likely persist in 2025.\nStill-soft global economic growth and uncertainty around looming policy changes have acted as headwinds for the manufacturing sector. Business capital spending has been somewhat limited in range, but the Company's forecast anticipates faster growth over the back half of 2025, in part reflecting expectations there will be a push to enhance labor productivity. Additionally, what is anticipated to be a more conducive regulatory environment could trigger a meaningful pick-up in merger and acquisition activity in 2025.\nMortgage rates moved higher along with yields on longer-dated U.S. Treasury securities during the fourth quarter of 2024, dealing a setback to construction and sales of new single family homes. Builders have been able to facilitate sales via aggressive use of incentives, including mortgage rate buydowns, but have been more focused on paring down spec inventories. As such, construction starts of new single family homes tailed off over the second half of 2024 and Regions' forecast anticipates further declines in 2025.\nThough the FOMC cut the Fed funds rate at their final meeting of 2024, it signaled a slower pace of rate cuts in 2025. Inflation pressures have proven to be more persistent than had been anticipated, and while having some concerns about cooling labor market conditions, FOMC members perceive growing upside risks to their inflation forecasts. Regions' baseline forecast anticipates two twenty-five basis point funds rate cuts in 2025, though the timing of any cuts remains somewhat uncertain, particularly given the perceived inflation impacts of looming changes to fiscal, trade, and immigration policy. To the extent there is less relief on the rates front than anticipated, potential downside risks from certain pockets of commercial real estate and the volume of debt in the non-financial corporate sector coming up for refinancing over coming quarters will continue to loom over the outlook.\nPatterns of economic activity within the Regions footprint are expected to be broadly similar to those seen for the U.S. as a whole. As the Company anticipated, the pace of domestic in-migration into the Regions footprint slowed in 2024, likely reflecting a less dynamic labor market and challenging housing market conditions. Still, this left the pace of domestic in-migration in line with pre-pandemic norms, and growth in total population in the footprint continued to easily outpace the national average, and that also remains the case with growth in nonfarm payrolls. Some of the metro areas which had seen the largest cumulative increases over the prior few years have begun to see house prices decline, but underlying demand, in part reflecting above-average population growth, will help stem the extent of any such declines. Also, given the extent to which house prices have risen over recent years in these markets, the declines in house prices do not threaten to push owners into negative equity positions.  \nThe economic environment, as described above, impacted Regions' forecast utilized in calculating the ACL as of December 31, 2024. See the \"Allowance\" section for further information.\n47\nTable of Contents\n \n2024 Results\nRegions reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.8 billion or $1.93 per diluted share in 2024 compared to net income available to common shareholders of $2.0 billion or $2.11 per diluted share in 2023.\nNet interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $4.9 billion in 2024 compared to $5.4 billion in 2023. The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.54 percent in 2024, reflecting a 36 basis point decrease from 2023. The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were primarily driven by higher funding costs, which included an increase in deposit costs due to continued re-mixing. Partially offsetting the increase in funding costs was higher asset yields benefiting from the maturity and continued replacement of lower-yielding, fixed-rate loans and securities. See Table 2 \"Volume and Yield/Rate Variances\" for further details.\nThe provision for credit losses totaled $487 million in 2024 compared to $553 million in 2023. The provision for credit losses was higher than net charge-offs by $29 million in 2024. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was driven primarily by asset quality normalization. Refer to the \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail.\nNon-interest income improved slightly, totaling $2.3 billion in both 2024 and 2023. The improvement was driven by increases in most categories, led by capital markets income. These increases were largely offset by net securities losses and decreased card and ATM fees. See Table 3 \"Non-Interest Income\" for further details. \nNon-interest expense was $4.2 billion in 2024 and $4.4 billion in 2023. The decrease was driven by declines in operational losses, FDIC insurance assessments primarily related to the special assessment initially recognized in 2023, and miscellaneous expenses. The declines were partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits. See Table 4 \"Non-Interest Expense\" for further details.\nRegions' effective tax rate was 19.6 percent in 2024 compared to 20.5 percent in 2023. See the \"Income Taxes\" section for further details.\nFor more information, refer to the following additional sections within this Form 10-K:\n•\n\"Operating Results\" section of MD&A\n•\n“Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin” discussion within the “Operating Results” section of MD&A\n•\n“Interest Rate Risk” discussion within the “Risk Management” section of MD&A\nCapital\nCapital Actions\nRegions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding CCAR results.\nOn April 20, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Regions repurchased approximately 34 million shares of common stock under this program, which reduced shareholders' equity by $614 million. On December 10, 2024, the Board authorized an extension of the common stock repurchase program through the fourth quarter of 2025.\nFor more information, refer to the following additional sections within this Form 10-K:\n•\n\"Shareholders' Equity\" discussion in MD&A\n•\n\"Regulatory Requirements\" section of MD&A\n•\nNote 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" to the consolidated financial statements\nRegulatory Capital\nRegions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. The Basel III Rules maintain the minimum guidelines for Regions to be considered well-capitalized for Tier 1 capital and Total capital at 6.0% and 10.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2024, Regions’ Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios were estimated to be 12.17% and 14.06%, respectively. \nThe Basel III Rules also officially defined CET1. Regions' CET1 ratio at December 31, 2024 was estimated to be 10.80%. \nFor more information, refer to the following additional sections within this Form 10-K:\n•\n“Supervision and Regulation” discussion within Item 1. Business\n48\nTable of Contents\n \n•\n\"Regulatory Requirements\" section of MD&A\n•\nNote 12 \"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions\" to the consolidated financial statements\nLoan Portfolio and Credit\nDuring 2024, total loans decreased by $1.7 billion or 1.7 percent compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the commercial portfolio of $1.2 billion. The decline in commercial loans, specifically commercial and industrial loans, is due to lower line of credit utilization and loans refinanced off the Company's balance sheet through the debt capital markets. Refer to the \"Portfolio Characteristics\" section for further discussion.\nNet charge-offs totaled $458 million, or 0.47 percent of average loans, in 2024, compared to $397 million, or 0.40 percent in 2023, driven by an increase in commercial and industrial  and commercial investor real estate mortgage net charge-offs. The allowance was 1.79 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31, 2024, an increase from 1.73 percent at December 31, 2023. The coverage ratio of allowance to non-performing loans excluding held for sale was 186 percent at December 31, 2024, compared to 211 percent at December 31, 2023.\nFor more information, refer to the following additional sections within this Form 10-K:\n•\n\"Portfolio Characteristics\" section of MD&A\n•\n“Allowance for Credit Losses” discussion within the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section of  MD&A\n•\n“Provision for Credit Losses” discussion within the “Operating Results” section of MD&A\n•\n“Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” and “Non-performing Assets” discussions within the “Balance Sheet Analysis” section of MD&A\n•\nNote 4 \"Loans\" to the consolidated financial statements \n•\nNote 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements\nLiquidity\nAt the end of 2024, Regions Bank had $7.8 billion in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 76 percent. Cash and cash equivalents at the parent company totaled $2.4 billion. Cash at the Federal Reserve increased from December 31, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company’s borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve was $21.6 billion based on available collateral. Borrowing availability with the FHLB was $10.2 billion based on available collateral at the same date. Regions also maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by the Company to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. \nRegions is required to conduct liquidity stress testing and measure its available sources of liquidity against minimums as established by Regions' internal liquidity policy. Regions was fully compliant with those requirements as of year-end. \nFor more information, refer to the following additional sections within this Form 10-K:\n•\n“Supervision and Regulation” discussion within Item 1. Business \n•\n“Borrowed Funds” discussion within the “Balance Sheet Analysis” section of MD&A\n•\n“Regulatory Requirements” section of MD&A\n•\n“Liquidity” discussion within the “Risk Management” section of MD&A\n•\nNote 11 \"Borrowed Funds\" to the consolidated financial statements\nGENERAL\nThe following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions’ financial position and results of operations. The emphasis of this discussion will be on operations for the years 2024 and 2023; in addition, financial information for prior years will also be presented when appropriate. \nRegions’ profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans, leases, investment securities and cash balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions’ net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and \n49\nTable of Contents\n \ntrust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, equipment and software expenses, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.\nEconomic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions’ market areas.\nRegions’ business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking.\nBusiness Segments\nRegions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, and other specialty financing. Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder in Other. \nSee Note 22 \"Business Segment Information\" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on Regions’ business segments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND RELATED POLICIES\nIn preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with GAAP, regulatory guidance, where applicable, and general banking practices. Estimates and assumptions most significant to Regions are related primarily to the allowance, fair value measurements, intangible assets (goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets), MSRs measured at fair value, and income taxes, and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance\nThe allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. Regions determines its allowance in accordance with GAAP and applicable regulatory guidance.\nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements for information about areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the allowance. \nThe allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as changes in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by changes in interest rates, inflation, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes. \nManagement considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts.\nChanges in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates.  Volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits, commodity prices, or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. The scenarios discussed below, or other scenarios, have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ, perhaps materially, from the originally estimated amounts. This analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on then-current circumstances and conditions.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in the allowance estimate. Changes in the factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be \n50\nTable of Contents\n \ndirectionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. However, to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast, Regions estimated the allowance using a scenario that was one standard deviation unfavorable to the expected scenario for each macroeconomic variable. This unfavorable scenario resulted in an allowance approximately 15 percent higher than the allowance using the expected scenario.\nSimilar to the scenarios above, it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in credit risk factors might affect the overall allowance because of the wide variety of credit risk factors that are considered in estimating the allowance. Changes in risk ratings may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across product or industry types. Regions conducted a separate sensitivity analysis considering deteriorating conditions for commercial and investor real estate portfolio factors by stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions. Regions stressed risk ratings by one downgrade for commercial and investor real estate loans. This scenario resulted in an allowance approximately 20 percent higher for the commercial and investor real estate portfolios.\nFair Value Measurements\nA portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These include debt securities available for sale, mortgage loans held for sale, equity investments (with and without readily determinable market values), residential MSRs, commercial MSRs through non-DUS agency programs and derivative assets and liabilities. From time to time, the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate, which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan/property or fair value, less estimated costs to sell the property. For example, the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information, less estimated selling costs. Adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types. The determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates, including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.\nFair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. While management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to “normal” market activity, management’s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party investor under current market conditions. The value to the Company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates.\nA fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. Fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the Company utilizes. Fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (Level 1 valuations). If market prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (Level 2 valuations). Where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on Company-specific data (Level 3 valuations). These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company’s own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability.\nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value, including pricing validation processes.\nIntangible Assets \nRegions’ intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses (“goodwill”) and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily relationship assets and agency commercial real estate licenses). Goodwill totaled $5.7 billion at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Goodwill is allocated to each of Regions’ reportable segments (each a reporting unit: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management). Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist (refer to Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). \nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2024, by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed.  In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory actions and assessments, \n51\nTable of Contents\n \nchanges in the business climate, company-specific factors, and trends in the banking industry.  After assessing the totality of the events and circumstances, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management reporting units exceed their respective carrying values. Therefore, a quantitative impairment test was not required. Refer to Note 9 \"Intangible Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill.\nSpecific factors as of the date of filing the consolidated financial statements that could negatively impact the assumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment include: a protracted decline in the Company’s market capitalization; adverse business trends resulting from litigation and/or regulatory actions; higher loan losses; forecasts of high unemployment levels; future increased minimum regulatory capital requirements above current thresholds (refer to Note 12 \"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions\" to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current minimum regulatory requirements); future federal rules and regulations (e.g., such as those resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act); and/or significant volatility in interest rates.\nOther identifiable intangible assets such as relationship assets and agency commercial real estate licenses are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset. These events could include loss of customer relationships, increased competition, or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount. These events or circumstances, if they occur, could be material to Regions’ operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s review indicated there was no impairment in the value of the other identifiable intangible assets.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nRegions has elected to measure and report both its residential MSRs and commercial MSRs through non-DUS agency programs using the fair value method. Although sales of MSRs do occur, MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available, and are therefore Level 3 valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed in the \"Fair Value Measurements\" section. Specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential and commercial MSRs. As a result, Regions stratifies its portfolios on the basis of certain risk characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate, as applicable. Regions values its residential and commercial MSRs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques. These techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, escrow balances and servicing costs. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of MSRs which impacts earnings. \nRefer to Note 6 \"Servicing of Financial Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information including quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of MSRs.  \nIncome Taxes\nAccrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect management’s estimate of income taxes to be paid or received. The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and multiple state and local jurisdictions. The tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the Company and the relevant government taxing authorities. Therefore, the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining tax accruals and evaluating the Company’s tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions.\nDeferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method with the net balance reported in other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. In projecting future taxable income, the Company utilizes forecasted pre-tax earnings, adjusts for the estimated temporary differences and incorporates assumptions, including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions. Determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards.\nThe Company’s estimate of accrued income taxes, deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions, as well as changes in income tax rates and changes in operating activities. Any changes, if they occur, can be significant to the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n52\nTable of Contents\n \nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 19 \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements for further details and discussion.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN \nNet interest income is Regions’ principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of Regions’ ability to meet its overall performance goals. Both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by both long-term and short-term market interest rates. Long-term and short-term rates were higher for most of 2024 compared to 2023. Late in the third quarter of 2024, the FOMC decreased the Fed funds rate by approximately 50 basis points and by an additional 25 basis points at the November and December meetings, for a total of 100 basis points. See the \"Executive Overview\" for a discussion of recent FOMC activity.\nNet interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) decreased by $503 million in 2024 compared to 2023, and net interest margin decreased by 36 basis points to 3.54 percent in 2024. This represents a normalization from elevated post-pandemic levels. The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were driven primarily by higher funding costs in a prolonged high rate environment. In 2024, funding costs, which includes deposits and wholesale borrowings utilized during the year, increased to 1.73 percent compared to 1.19 percent in 2023. The increase in funding costs was driven by higher deposit costs due to continued deposit remixing as depositors moved into higher interest earning products, albeit at a slower pace than the remixing experienced in 2023. Deposit costs increased to 1.56 percent for 2024 compared to 0.99 percent for 2023.  \nPartially offsetting the increase in funding costs were higher asset yields benefiting from the maturity and continued replacement of lower-yielding, fixed-rate loans and securities. The Company's loan yields are primarily influenced by short-term interest rates such as 30-day term SOFR, which averaged 5.19 percent in 2024 compared to 4.98 percent in 2023. Additionally, fixed-rate lending production, which contains significant residential mortgage fixed-rate exposure, benefited from higher middle and long-term rates. The Company also continued its reinvestment strategy in the securities portfolio and executed multiple, distinct debt securities repositioning transactions. As a result, the debt securities yield increased to 2.89 percent in 2024 from 2.38 percent in 2023.

Interest income on loans, net of unearned income, also includes net loan fees of $142 million, $130 million and $109 million for the years ended  December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 , respectively.\n(6)\nTotal deposit costs may be calculated by dividing total interest expense on deposits by the sum of interest-bearing deposits and non-interest-bearing deposits.

Over recent years, changes in the interest rate environment and the impact on product pricing and mix has been the primary contributor to changes in net interest income. \nThe mix of earning assets can affect the interest rate spread. Regions’ primary types of earning assets are loans and investment securities. Certain types of earning assets have historically generated larger spreads; for example, loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets, such as securities or interest-bearing deposits in other banks. Average earning assets in 2024 totaled $137.5 billion, a decrease of $383 million as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a modest decline in loans, net of unearned income, partially offset by growth in debt securities and interest-bearing deposits in other banks. See the \"Loans\" and \"Debt Securities\" sections for further details. \nThe mix of interest-bearing liabilities can also affect the interest spread. Funding for Regions’ earning assets comes from interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing sources. As previously discussed, in 2024 the Company continued to experience a remixing of deposits into higher-interest-bearing categories, albeit at a slower pace. Higher balances within these categories contributed to the overall increase in funding costs.  \n PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance sheet date. During 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled $487 million and net charge-offs were $458 million. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $553 million and net charge-offs of $397 million in 2023.\nFor further discussion and analysis of the total allowance for credit losses, see the \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" and  “Risk Management” sections found later in this report. See also Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n55\nTable of Contents\n \nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nTable 3—Non-Interest Income \n \nYear Ended December 31\nChange 2024 vs. 2023\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount\nPercent\n(Dollars in millions)\nService charges on deposit accounts \n$\n612 \n$\n592 \n$\n641 \n$\n20 \n3.4 \n%\nCard and ATM fees\n467 \n504 \n513 \n(37)\n(7.3)\n%\nCapital markets income\n348 \n222 \n339 \n126 \n56.8 \n%\nInvestment management and trust fee income\n338 \n313 \n297 \n25 \n8.0 \n%\nMortgage income\n146 \n109 \n156 \n37 \n33.9 \n%\nInvestment services fee income\n157 \n138 \n122 \n19 \n13.8 \n%\nCommercial credit fee income\n111 \n105 \n96 \n6 \n5.7 \n%\nBank-owned life insurance\n102 \n78 \n62 \n24 \n30.8 \n%\nMarket valuation adjustments on employee benefit assets\n25 \n15 \n(45)\n10 \n66.7 \n%\nInsurance proceeds \n(1)\n— \n— \n50 \n— \nNM\nSecurities gains (losses), net\n(208)\n(5)\n(1)\n(203)\nNM\nOther miscellaneous income\n167 \n185 \n199 \n(18)\n(9.7)\n%\n$\n2,265 \n$\n2,256 \n$\n2,429 \n$\n9 \n0.4 \n%\n_______  \nNM- Not meaningful.\n(1) In the third quarter of 2022, the Company settled a previously disclosed matter with the CFPB. The Company received an insurance reimbursement in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the settlement.\nService Charges on Deposit Accounts\nService charges on deposit accounts include overdraft fees, treasury management fees and other customer transaction-related service charges. Service charges increased modestly in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by an increase in fees from treasury management services. Partially offsetting the increase was a decline in overdraft fees as a result of recent overdraft-related policy enhancements.\nOn October 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal  for public comment that, if finalized, would lower the maximum interchange fee that a large debit card issuer can receive for a debit card transaction. Under the proposed rule the maximum interchange fee would be subject to adjustments every other year based upon issuer cost data. The Company is studying the proposal and evaluating its impact.\nOn December 12, 2024, the CFPB adopted a final rule that caps overdraft fees in line with a benchmark fee of $5 or an amount that covers an institution's costs and losses using a standard set forth in the rules. Alternatively, an institution can charge higher overdraft fees by complying with the standard regulatory requirements governing other loans, including credit cards. The final rule is currently scheduled to take effect on October 1, 2025. However, under the presidential memorandum entitled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review,” rules with future effective dates may be re-evaluated. Therefore, though the Company will continue to monitor and evaluate potential impact, the nature and timing of future developments that may potentially impact this or other CFPB rules and proposals cannot be predicted. \nCard and ATM Fees\nCard and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. Card and ATM fees decreased in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by credit card rewards liability adjustments combined with higher trending rewards utilization, as well as a decline in foreign ATM revenue due to elimination of balance inquiry fees in February 2024.\nCapital Markets Income\nCapital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. Capital markets income increased in 2024 compared to 2023, impacted by a benefit from less negative credit/debit valuation adjustments due to rate and spread movements. Additionally, all other categories of capital markets income were higher year-over-year due to increased transaction volume and deal activity.\n56\nTable of Contents\n \nMortgage Income \nMortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The increase in mortgage income in 2024 compared to 2023 was due primarily to an increase in servicing income due to bulk purchases of the rights to service $6.2 billion of residential mortgage loans in the third quarter of 2023 and $8 billion of residential mortgage loans at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in mortgage production and margins sold to the agencies. These increases were offset by a reduction in the valuation of MSRs and related hedges.\nInvestment Services Fee Income\nInvestment services fee income represents income earned from investment advisory services. Investment services fee income increased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to strong advisor production.\nBank-owned Life Insurance\nBank-owned life insurance income primarily represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. Bank-owned life insurance income increased during 2024 compared to 2023 driven primarily by increased claim volume.\nMarket Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets\nMarket value adjustments on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. The adjustments are offset in salaries and benefits and other non-interest expense.\nSecurities Gains (Losses), Net\nNet securities gains (losses) primarily result from the Company's asset/liability and capital management processes. In 2024, the Company sold debt securities and reinvested the proceeds at higher current market yields, incurring $205 million in total pre-tax losses. See Table 5 \"Debt Securities\" for more information. An additional $3 million in losses was incurred associated with the sale of certain employee benefit assets. \nTable 4—Non-Interest Expense \n \n \nYear Ended December 31\nChange 2024 vs 2023\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount\nPercent\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$\n2,529 \n$\n2,416 \n$\n2,318 \n$\n113 \n4.7 \n%\nEquipment and software expense\n406 \n412 \n392 \n(6)\n(1.5)\n%\nNet occupancy expense\n278 \n289 \n300 \n(11)\n(3.8)\n%\nOutside services\n162 \n163 \n157 \n(1)\n(0.6)\n%\nMarketing\n110 \n110 \n102 \n— \n— \n%\nProfessional, legal and regulatory expenses\n94 \n85 \n263 \n9 \n10.6 \n%\nCredit/checkcard expenses\n59 \n60 \n66 \n(1)\n(1.7)\n%\nFDIC insurance assessments\n109 \n228 \n61 \n(119)\n(52.2)\n%\nVisa class B shares expense\n32 \n28 \n24 \n4 \n14.3 \n%\nOperational losses\n95 \n212 \n56 \n(117)\n(55.2)\n%\nEarly extinguishment of debt\n— \n(4)\n— \n4 \n100.0 \n%\nBranch consolidation, property and equipment charges\n3 \n7 \n3 \n(4)\n(57.1)\n%\nOther miscellaneous expenses\n365 \n410 \n326 \n(45)\n(11.0)\n%\n$\n4,242 \n$\n4,416 \n$\n4,068 \n$\n(174)\n(3.9)\n%\nSalaries and Employee Benefits\nSalaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in incentives, base salaries, and benefits expenses. Salaries and employee benefits were also impacted by an increase in market valuation adjustments on employee benefit assets that are offset in non-interest income. Full-time equivalent headcount decreased to 19,644 at December 31, 2024 from 20,101 at  December 31, 2023.\nProfessional, Legal and Regulatory Expenses\nProfessional, legal, and regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal and regulatory expenses increased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to accruals for legal and regulatory matters in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower other professional fees.\n57\nTable of Contents\n \nFDIC Insurance Assessments\nFDIC insurance assessments decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily resulting from the special assessment that was initially recorded in 2023.\nFederal law requires that any losses to the FDIC’s DIF related to the protection of uninsured depositors under the Systemic Risk Exception be repaid by a special assessment on IDIs. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the FDIC finalized a special assessment related to the two March 2023 bank failures, which was required to be recognized as the accrual of a liability and related expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $119 million. In late February 2024, the FDIC published revised loss estimates related to the failures, increasing the estimated loss to the DIF. Based on updated information provided by the FDIC, Regions increased the special assessment accrual during 2024 by $16 million. The total special assessment is to be paid in ten quarterly installments that began with the invoice for the first quarter of 2024 (received in June 2024) and are deductible for income taxes.\nIn addition to the reduction in accruals for the special assessment, favorability in the base assessment which was driven by higher levels of unsecured debt and cash as well as lower exposures in higher risk assets, further drove the year-over-year decrease in FDIC insurance assessments.\nOperational Losses\nOperational losses include losses related to fraud, execution, delivery and process management, and damage to physical assets. Operational losses decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to check fraud that occurred in the second and third quarters of 2023.\nOther Miscellaneous Expenses \nOther miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. Other miscellaneous expenses decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to lower pension related costs and a reduction for a contingent reserve release in the second quarter of 2024 related to a prior acquisition.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company’s income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $461 million compared to $533 million in 2023, resulting in effective tax rates of 19.6% and 20.5%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2024 was primarily due to lower pre-tax income in 2024 as compared to 2023, causing tax preferential items to have a more favorable impact to the effective tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to UTBs. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company reported a net deferred tax asset of $775 million compared to $741 million at December 31, 2023. \nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 19 \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nThe following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories. \nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash and cash equivalents increased approximately $3.9 billion from $6.8 billion at December 31, 2023 to $10.7 billion at December 31, 2024 resulting from an increase in cash balances on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank driven primarily by FHLB advances utilized in 2024. Cash balances were also impacted by a decline in loans. See the \"Loans\", \"Liquidity\" and \"Borrowed Funds\" sections for more information.\n58\nTable of Contents\n \nDEBT SECURITIES\n The following table details the carrying values of debt securities, including both held to maturity and available for sale, as of December 31:\nTable 5—Debt Securities \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nU.S. Treasury securities\n$\n2,003 \n$\n1,223 \nFederal agency securities\n444 \n1,043 \nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n2 \n2 \nMortgage-backed securities:\nResidential agency\n22,865 \n17,611 \nCommercial agency\n4,597 \n7,822 \nCommercial non-agency\n82 \n83 \nCorporate and other debt securities\n658 \n1,074 \n$\n30,651 \n$\n28,858 \nDebt securities, which comprise approximately 22 percent of earning assets, are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company, as much of the portfolio is highly liquid. Additionally, some of the securities portfolio is eligible to be used as collateral for funding of various types of borrowings. See the \"Liquidity\" section for more information on these arrangements.  Also see the \"Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk\" section for more information.\nDebt securities held to maturity constituted approximately 14 percent of the securities portfolio at December 31, 2024. The Company reclassified securities with an amortized cost, excluding items recognized in OCI, of $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion, in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, respectively, from available for sale into held to maturity to reduce the volatility in AOCI in preparation for expected, upcoming changes to regulatory guidance as discussed in the \"Regulatory Requirements\" section. See also Note 3 \"Debt Securities\" for additional information.\nDebt securities available for sale, constituted approximately 86 percent of the securities portfolio at December 31, 2024. Regions maintains a highly-rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency MBS. Regions’ investment policy emphasizes credit quality and liquidity. Debt securities backed by the U.S. Government and government sponsored agencies, both on a direct and indirect basis, represented approximately 98 percent of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2024. All other debt securities rated below AAA, not backed by the U.S. Government or government sponsored agencies, or which are not rated represented approximately 2 percent of total debt securities at December 31, 2024. \nDebt securities increased $1.8 billion from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 as the Company purchased $750 million of residential agency MBS securities with proceeds from a debt issuance in the second quarter of 2024 and an additional $1.0 billion of residential agency MBS securities and U.S Treasury securities with proceeds from a debt issuance in the third quarter of 2024 (see Note 11 \"Borrowed Funds\"). Additionally, four distinct securities repositioning transactions occurred during 2024 involving the sale of mostly shorter-duration commercial agency MBS and replacement with residential agency MBS with favorable prepayment profiles. The intent was to maintain the securities portfolio duration that would otherwise shorten naturally. Proceeds from the sales were reinvested at higher market yields. Through these transactions, in 2024, the Company sold approximately $4.3 billion of debt securities available for sale and realized approximately $205 million in pre-tax losses. \nThe average life of the debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2024 was estimated to be 6.1 years, with a duration of approximately 4.5 years. These metrics compare with an estimated average life of 5.5 years and a duration of approximately 4.5 years for the portfolio at December 31, 2023.\n59\nTable of Contents\n \nTable 6 \"Relative Contractual Maturities\" details the contractual maturities of debt securities, including held to maturity and available for sale, and the related weighted-average yields.\nTable 6— Relative Contractual Maturities \n \nDebt Securities Maturing as of December 31, 2024\n \nWithin One\nYear\nAfter One But\nWithin Five\nYears\nAfter Five But\nWithin Ten\nYears\nAfter Ten\nYears\nTotal\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nU.S. Treasury securities\n$\n131 \n$\n1,495 \n$\n372 \n$\n5 \n$\n2,003 \nFederal agency securities\n— \n— \n330 \n114 \n444 \nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n— \n— \n— \n2 \n2 \nMortgage-backed securities:\nResidential agency\n6 \n75 \n859 \n21,925 \n22,865 \nCommercial agency\n247 \n2,293 \n1,841 \n216 \n4,597 \nCommercial non-agency\n— \n— \n— \n82 \n82 \nCorporate and other debt securities\n196 \n436 \n24 \n2 \n658 \n$\n580 \n$\n4,299 \n$\n3,426 \n$\n22,346 \n$\n30,651 \nWeighted-average yield \n(1)\n2.20 \n%\n2.76 \n%\n3.30 \n%\n3.13 \n%\n3.08 \n%\n_________\n(1)\nThe weighted-average yields are calculated on the basis of the yield to maturity based on the carrying value of each debt security.

The levels of residential first mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations fluctuate depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties. \nLOANS\nGENERAL\nLoans, net of unearned income, represented 70 percent of interest-earning assets as of December 31, 2024 compared to 74 percent as of December 31, 2023. Lending at Regions is generally organized along three portfolio segments: commercial loans (including commercial and industrial, and owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans), investor real estate loans (commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans) and consumer loans (residential first mortgage, home equity lines and loans, consumer credit card, other consumer—exit portfolios, and other consumer loans). \n60\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table illustrates a year-over-year comparison of loans, net of unearned income, by portfolio segment and class as of December 31:\nTable 8—Loan Portfolio \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions, net of unearned income)\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n49,671 \n$\n50,865 \nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n4,841 \n4,887 \nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n333 \n281 \nTotal commercial\n54,845 \n56,033 \nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n6,567 \n6,605 \nCommercial investor real estate construction\n2,143 \n2,245 \nTotal investor real estate\n8,710 \n8,850 \nResidential first mortgage\n20,094 \n20,207 \nHome equity lines\n3,150 \n3,221 \nHome equity loans\n2,390 \n2,439 \nConsumer credit card\n1,445 \n1,341 \nOther consumer—exit portfolios\n4 \n43 \nOther consumer\n6,089 \n6,245 \nTotal consumer\n33,172 \n33,496 \n$\n96,727 \n$\n98,379 \nThe following table details the contractual maturities for loans as of December 31, 2024.

For some lending arrangements, Regions enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements to manage overall cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on variable rate loans. The agreements effectively modify the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swaps and interest rate floors. The impact of hedging is not considered within this disclosure. \nPORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS\n Loans, net of unearned income, decreased $1.7 billion year over year, primarily due to decreases in the commercial and industrial portfolio class. Regions manages loan growth with a focus on risk management and risk-adjusted return on capital. \nThe following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and classes disclosed in Table 9, explain changes in balances from year-end 2023 and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, and certain loan products. See Note 4 \"Loans\" and Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. \nCommercial\nThe commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans for use in customers' normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, expansion projects and acquisitions. Regions' commercial loans generally mature within a five-year period with applicable amortization based on the underlying collateral or financing purpose. Typical loan structures consist of revolving and non-revolving lines of credit, amortizing term loans, guidance facilities, and single-pay loans, further tailored to meet the specific needs of the customer. These loans frequently have a covenant package combination inclusive of applicable debt service coverage, leverage, and liquidity measurements.\nUnderwriting of commercial loans includes the assessment of the financial performance and profile, management experience and capability, industry position and outlook, the applicability of the transactional structure, as well as the repayment enhancement provided by collateral, guarantees, and ownership or sponsorship. Any forward view of operating performance is tested against applicable stressors that may include revenue decline, margin compression, and interest rate hikes. \nCommercial and industrial loans decreased $1.2 billion since year-end 2023, due to lower line of credit utilization and loans refinanced off the Company's balance sheet through the debt capital markets. Throughout 2024, the decline in commercial and industrial loans was broad-based as shown in Table 11.\nThe commercial portfolio also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing on real estate assets, and are repaid by cash generated by business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. These owner-occupied real estate and real estate construction loans generally mature within a 10 year period and with amortization periods reflecting the longer life of the underlying collateral. Typical structure is an amortizing term loan, though construction loans are short-term, monitored, non-revolving draw facilities. These loans frequently have a covenant package combination \n62\nTable of Contents\n \nconsistent with the underwriting of commercial loans, inclusive of applicable debt service coverage, leverage, and liquidity measurements.\nUnderwriting for owner-occupied real estate and real estate construction loans is consistent with the underwriting of commercial loans, with particular attention to the enhancement provided by the underlying real estate collateral. \nReal estate appraisals, for both commercial and IRE loans, are performed in accordance with regulatory guidelines. In some cases, reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed. An appraisal is ordered and reviewed prior to loan closing, and a new appraisal or evaluation is generally ordered when market conditions indicate a potential decline in the value of the collateral, or when the loan is either modified, renewed, or deteriorates to a certain level of credit weaknesses. \nOver half of the Company’s total loans are included in the commercial portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as noted in Table 11. The Company manages the related risks to this portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry. \nInvestor Real Estate\nLoans for real estate development are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions’ IRE portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions’ markets. Additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total IRE loans decreased $140 million in comparison to year-end 2023 balances. \nIRE loans generally mature within a three-to-seven-year period and consist of full, partial, and non-recourse guarantee structures. Typical term loan structures include annually testing operating covenants that require loan rebalancing based on minimum debt service coverage, debt yield, and/or LTV tests. Construction and land development loans generally mature in 12 to 24 months for acquisition and development, to 42 to 60 months for construction and contain full or partial recourse guarantee structures with 12 to 24 month extension options or roll-to-permanent financing options that often result in term loans. \nUnderwriting on IRE properties is based on the economic viability of the project with significant consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor, who is responsible for managing the property. The Company generally requires that the owner, who provides the capital to purchase the property, infuse their equity prior to any advances. Re-margining requirements (e.g., required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral) are often included in the loan agreement along with required guarantees of the sponsor.\n63\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following tables provide detail of Regions' commercial and IRE lending balances in selected industries as of December 31.\nTable 11—Commercial and Investor Real Estate Industry Exposure\n2024\nLoans\nUnfunded Commitments\nTotal Exposure\nPercent of Balance\n(In millions)\nCommercial:\nAdministrative, support, waste and repair\n$\n1,306 \n$\n751 \n$\n2,057 \n2.0 \n%\nAgriculture\n211 \n142 \n353 \n0.3 \n%\nEducational services\n3,229 \n875 \n4,104 \n4.0 \n%\nEnergy \n1,322 \n3,484 \n4,806 \n4.7 \n%\nFinancial services \n8,463 \n9,308 \n17,771 \n17.4 \n%\nGovernment and public sector\n3,121 \n437 \n3,558 \n3.5 \n%\nHealthcare\n3,338 \n2,480 \n5,818 \n5.7 \n%\nInformation\n2,186 \n1,115 \n3,301 \n3.2 \n%\nManufacturing \n5,037 \n5,138 \n10,175 \n9.9 \n%\nProfessional, scientific and technical services \n1,970 \n1,736 \n3,706 \n3.6 \n%\nReal estate\n (1)\n8,857 \n9,110 \n17,967 \n17.6 \n%\nReligious, leisure, personal and non-profit services\n1,579 \n852 \n2,431 \n2.4 \n%\nRestaurant, accommodation and lodging\n1,285 \n216 \n1,501 \n1.5 \n%\nRetail trade\n2,604 \n1,908 \n4,512 \n4.4 \n%\nTransportation and warehousing\n3,655 \n1,645 \n5,300 \n5.2 \n%\nUtilities\n2,329 \n3,223 \n5,552 \n5.4 \n%\nWholesale goods\n4,232 \n3,371 \n7,603 \n7.4 \n%\nOther \n(2)\n121 \n1,677 \n1,798 \n1.8 \n%\nTotal commercial\n$\n54,845 \n$\n47,468 \n$\n102,313 \n100 \n%\nInvestor real estate:\nHotel\n$\n188 \n$\n18 \n$\n206 \n1.8 \n%\nIndustrial\n808 \n160 \n968 \n8.5 \n%\nLand\n74 \n49 \n123 \n1.1 \n%\nMulti-family\n3,834 \n1,417 \n5,251 \n46.2 \n%\nOffice\n1,325 \n34 \n1,359 \n12.0 \n%\nRetail\n314 \n2 \n316 \n2.8 \n%\nSingle-family/condo\n668 \n467 \n1,135 \n10.0 \n%\nData center\n215 \n32 \n247 \n2.2 \n%\nSelf storage\n16 \n1 \n17 \n0.1 \n%\nOther \n(2)\n1,268 \n482 \n1,750 \n15.3 \n%\nTotal investor real estate\n$\n8,710 \n$\n2,662 \n$\n11,372 \n100 \n%\n64\nTable of Contents\n \n2023 \n(3)\nLoans\nUnfunded Commitments\nTotal Exposure\nPercent of Balance\n(In millions)\nCommercial:\nAdministrative, support, waste and repair\n$\n1,461 \n$\n916 \n$\n2,377 \n2.3 \n%\nAgriculture\n239 \n208 \n447 \n0.4 \n%\nEducational services\n3,502 \n827 \n4,329 \n4.2 \n%\nEnergy\n1,484 \n3,349 \n4,833 \n4.7 \n%\nFinancial services \n7,562 \n8,428 \n15,990 \n15.5 \n%\nGovernment and public sector\n3,161 \n414 \n3,575 \n3.5 \n%\nHealthcare\n3,216 \n2,478 \n5,694 \n5.5 \n%\nInformation\n2,791 \n1,250 \n4,041 \n3.9 \n%\nManufacturing \n4,789 \n5,122 \n9,911 \n9.6 \n%\nProfessional, scientific and technical services\n \n2,328 \n1,799 \n4,127 \n4.0 \n%\nReal estate \n(1)\n9,166 \n9,219 \n18,385 \n17.8 \n%\nReligious, leisure, personal and non-profit services\n1,562 \n630 \n2,192 \n2.1 \n%\nRestaurant, accommodation and lodging\n1,408 \n289 \n1,697 \n1.7 \n%\nRetail trade\n2,764 \n2,327 \n5,091 \n4.9 \n%\nTransportation and warehousing\n \n3,486 \n1,858 \n5,344 \n5.2 \n%\nUtilities\n3,044 \n2,732 \n5,776 \n5.6 \n%\nWholesale goods \n4,006 \n3,768 \n7,774 \n7.5 \n%\nOther \n(2)\n64 \n1,511 \n1,575 \n1.6 \n%\nTotal commercial\n$\n56,033 \n$\n47,125 \n$\n103,158 \n100 \n%\nInvestor real estate:\nHotel\n$\n218 \n$\n5 \n$\n223 \n1.8 \n%\nIndustrial\n740 \n141 \n881 \n7.1 \n%\nLand\n109 \n38 \n147 \n1.2 \n%\nMulti-family\n3,483 \n2,103 \n5,586 \n45.3 \n%\nOffice\n1,426 \n64 \n1,490 \n12.1 \n%\nRetail\n340 \n4 \n344 \n2.8 \n%\nSingle-family/condo\n698 \n591 \n1,289 \n10.4 \n%\nData center\n321 \n12 \n333 \n2.7 \n%\nSelf storage\n16 \n3 \n19 \n0.2 \n%\nOther \n(2)\n1,499 \n531 \n2,030 \n16.4 \n%\nTotal investor real estate\n$\n8,850 \n$\n3,492 \n$\n12,342 \n100 \n%\n_______\n(1)\n\"Real estate\" includes REITs, which are unsecured commercial and industrial products that are real estate related.

When these changes occur, Regions does not recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed appropriate. As a result, year over year changes may be impacted.\n65\nTable of Contents\n \nThe Company's total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate lending consists of both unsecured commercial and industrial loans that are real estate related (including REITs) and investor real estate loans and are considered to be well diversified across property types. The following table provides detail of these loans: \nTable 12— Unsecured Commercial Real Estate and Investor Real Estate Exposure\nDecember 31, 2024\nLoan Balance\nPercent of Total \n(1)\n(In millions)\nResidential homebuilders\n$\n1,081 \n7.1 \n%\nApartments \n4,371 \n28.6 \n%\nIndustrial\n2,287 \n15.0 \n%\nData center\n332 \n2.2 \n%\nDiversified\n1,740 \n11.4 \n%\nBusiness offices \n1,473 \n9.6 \n%\nResidential land\n55 \n0.4 \n%\nRetail\n1,458 \n9.5 \n%\nHealthcare \n1,129 \n7.4 \n%\nHotel\n785 \n5.1 \n%\nCommercial land\n19 \n0.1 \n%\nSelf Storage\n296 \n1.9 \n%\nOther\n260 \n1.7 \n%\nTotal \n(2)\n$\n15,286 \n100 \n%\n_______\n(1)\nAmounts calculated based on whole dollar values.\n(2)\nOwner-occupied commercial real estate is not included as the principal source of repayment is individual businesses, which more closely aligns with the commercial portfolio credit performance. \nPortfolios that are experiencing higher risk due to conditions such as inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and adverse underlying market fundamentals resulting in rising vacancies and reductions in net effective rents are identified as portfolios of interest. These portfolios have an increased focus through credit management and monitoring in order to accurately capture risk and enhance strategies for positive resolutions. Included within Table 11 above, the business offices, senior housing (included within healthcare), and trucking (including within transportation and warehousing) portfolios are considered by Regions to be portfolios of interest. The multi-family portfolio that was previously identified as a portfolio of interest was removed in the fourth quarter of 2024 as Regions does not expect near term losses nor has there been a significant amount of downward migration to non-performing status. Recent and potential future interest rate cuts should ease pressure on borrowers across the entire loan portfolio. See Table 13 below for more details on these portfolios, as well as the allowance discussion following Table 16.\nTable 13—Portfolios of Interest\nAs of and for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024\nOffice \n(1)\nSenior Housing \n(2)\nTrucking \n(3)\n(Dollars in millions)\nCommitments\n$\n1,546 \n$\n1,215 \n$\n1,941 \nLoan balance\n$\n1,473 \n$\n1,077 \n$\n1,514 \nLoan balance as a percent of total loans\n1.5 \n%\n1.1 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nNon-performing loans\n$\n241 \n$\n114 \n$\n105 \nCharge-offs\n$\n32 \n$\n10 \n$\n35 \nRelated allowance for credit losses to loans\n7.5 \n%\n3.7 \n%\n5.4 \n%\n___\n(1)    Approximately 89 percent of the office portfolio was secured, with approximately 60 percent of secured balances located in the South region of the U.S, of which 90% were Class A properties. Additionally, the IRE office portfolio had a weighted-average LTV of approximately 69 percent at December 31, 2024, based upon appraisal at origination or most recent received, and a stressed weighted-average LTV of approximately 85 percent as of January 7, 2025, based upon GreenStreet's Commercial Property Price Index. No new loan originations are being contemplated in this portfolio.\n(2)   Senior housing herein represents the CRE portfolio and excludes approximately $147 million in non-real estate commercial loans in the senior housing sector. Client activity in senior housing has been limited for several years as the portfolio has recovered from the vacancy rate lows of 2020-2021, but signs of improvement have been observed with expected improvements continuing in 2025.\n(3)   Considered a portfolio of interest as trucking companies have been working through one of the most prolonged downturns in the U.S. domestic freight market, recent measures of freight demand remained mostly positive. While there is optimism for the industry, the recovery in 2025 is expected to be gradual. Regions' strategy remains primarily centered around larger, existing clients and slowing originations of smaller trucking deals at this point in the cycle. \n66\nTable of Contents\n \nResidential First Mortgage\nResidential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Total residential first mortgage loans decreased $113 million in comparison to year-end 2023 balances. \nHome Equity Lines\nHome equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Home equity lines decreased $71 million in comparison to year-end 2023 balances, as payoffs and paydowns continue to outpace production. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions' branch network. \nBeginning in December 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment term. During the 10-year draw period customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. From May 2009 to December 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. Prior to May 2009, the predominant structure was a 20-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term “balloon payment” means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit.\nThe following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of December 31, 2024. The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period.\nTable 14—Home Equity Lines of Credit - Future Principal Payment Resets\nFirst Lien\n% of Total\nSecond Lien\n% of Total\nTotal\n(Dollars in millions)\n2025\n$\n78 \n2.47 \n%\n$\n73 \n2.33 \n%\n$\n151 \n2026\n102 \n3.23 \n%\n106 \n3.37 \n%\n208 \n2027\n253 \n8.04 \n%\n214 \n6.79 \n%\n467 \n2028\n248 \n7.86 \n%\n160 \n5.11 \n%\n408 \n2029\n106 \n3.36 \n%\n77 \n2.44 \n%\n183 \n2030-2034\n600 \n19.06 \n%\n1,029 \n32.65 \n%\n1,629 \n2035-2039\n4 \n0.13 \n%\n4 \n0.12 \n%\n8 \nThereafter\n7 \n0.22 \n%\n6 \n0.18 \n%\n13 \nRevolving Loans Converted to Amortizing\n50 \n1.60 \n%\n33 \n1.04 \n%\n83 \nTotal\n$\n1,448 \n45.97 \n%\n$\n1,702 \n54.03 \n%\n$\n3,150 \nHome Equity Loans\nHome equity loans are also secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, are primarily originated as amortizing loans, and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions’ branch network.\nConsumer Credit Quality Data\nThe Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products (“current LTV”). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party that is updated typically every three months. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.\nThe following table presents current LTV data for components of the residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the entire balance is included in the “Above 100%” category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall. \n67\nTable of Contents\n \nTable 15—Estimated Current Loan to Value Ranges\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nResidential\nFirst Mortgage\nHome Equity Lines of Credit\nHome Equity Loans\n \n1st Lien\n2nd Lien\n1st Lien\n2nd Lien\n \n(In millions)\nEstimated current LTV:\nAbove 100%\n$\n63 \n$\n2 \n$\n— \n$\n1 \n$\n— \nAbove 80% - 100%\n1,799 \n2 \n3 \n9 \n11 \n80% and below\n17,898 \n1,430 \n1,687 \n1,883 \n484 \nData not available\n334 \n14 \n12 \n2 \n— \n$\n20,094 \n$\n1,448 \n$\n1,702 \n$\n1,895 \n$\n495 \n \nDecember 31, 2023\nResidential\nFirst Mortgage\nHome Equity Lines of Credit\nHome Equity Loans\n \n1st Lien\n2nd Lien\n1st Lien\n2nd Lien\n \n(In millions)\nEstimated current LTV:\n`\nAbove 100%\n$\n57 \n$\n2 \n$\n— \n$\n2 \n$\n— \nAbove 80% - 100%\n1,822 \n3 \n2 \n5 \n7 \n80% and below\n17,981 \n1,567 \n1,619 \n2,055 \n365 \nData not available\n347 \n15 \n13 \n5 \n— \n$\n20,207 \n$\n1,587 \n$\n1,634 \n$\n2,067 \n$\n372 \nConsumer Credit Card\nConsumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans. Consumer credit card increased $104 million from year-end 2023 driven by both active account and balance per account growth. \nOther Consumer—Exit Portfolios\nExit portfolios primarily include lending initiatives through third parties consisting of loans made through automotive dealerships. Regions ceased originating new loans related to these businesses prior to 2020 and therefore the portfolio balances have been in run-off. \nOther Consumer\nOther consumer loans primarily include indirect and direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans decreased $156 million from year-end 2023 driven by a decline in certain direct lending channels and a slight decline in consumer home improvement lending.\nRegions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores, accrual status, days past due status, unemployment rates, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for the consumer loan portfolio. FICO scores are obtained at origination and refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for most consumer loans. For more information on credit quality indicators refer to Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\". \nALLOWANCE\nThe allowance represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan portfolio and consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments includes items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. The allowance totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios.\nRegions' quarterly allowance estimation process utilizes loss forecasting models for pooled loans, specific reserves for significant individually evaluated non-performing loans, and qualitative adjustments for items not captured by the models including specific adjustments and general imprecision. Key inputs to Regions' loss forecasting models include, but are not limited to, loan risk ratings (commercial and investor real estate loans), maturity date, days past due and FICO scores (consumer loans), collateral values securing loans, and Regions' internally prepared economic forecast. Changes in any of these factors, assumptions, or the availability of new information, could require the allowance to be adjusted in future periods, perhaps materially. Outputs from the loss forecasting models, in combination with Regions' qualitative framework and other analyses, inform management in its estimation of Regions' expected credit losses to ensure the overall allowance estimate is appropriate from both a bottom-up and top-down perspective. Actual losses could vary, perhaps materially, from management’s estimates. See Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for more information.\n68\nTable of Contents\n \nThe December 31, 2024 allowance was flat compared to September 30, 2024. The stable allowance resulted from increases in specific reserves driven by non-performing loans in portfolios of interest, offset by decreases due to moderate improvement in the economic forecast and decreases in qualitative adjustments as more of the portfolio risk was captured in the forecasting models and specific reserves. The following sections provide additional details on the key components of the allowance.\nBase economic forecast\nIn deriving any forecast, Regions benchmarks its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available.  Regions' December 2024 baseline forecast was stable compared to the September 2024 forecast. While job and wage growth are slowing, growth in labor earnings is expected to continue to outpace inflation. Global uncertainty and soft growth have acted as a headwind for manufacturing and business capital spending has been somewhat limited, but the Company expects faster growth in the back half of 2025. Core inflation is expected to slow further but remain above the FOMC's 2.0 percent target rate through 2025. The risks to the base economic forecast are considered to be balanced. See the Economic Environment in Regions' Banking Markets discussion in the \"Executive Overview\" section for additional information.\nTable 16 below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the base economic forecast over the two-year R&S forecast period as of December 31, 2024. The unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the allowance models and is expected to remain relatively consistent over the forecast period.\nTable 16— Macroeconomic Factors in the Forecast\n \nPre-R&S Period\nBase R&S Forecast\nDecember 31, 2024\n4Q2024\n1Q2025\n2Q2025\n3Q2025\n4Q2025\n1Q2026\n2Q2026\n3Q2026\n4Q2026\nUnemployment rate\n4.2 \n%\n4.2 \n%\n4.3 \n%\n4.3 \n%\n4.2 \n%\n4.1 \n%\n4.1 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n3.9 \n%\nReal GDP, annualized % change\n2.5 \n%\n2.2 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n2.3 \n%\n2.2 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n1.9 \n%\nHPI, year-over-year % change\n3.1 \n%\n2.6 \n%\n2.4 \n%\n1.8 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n1.5 \n%\n1.7 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n2.2 \n%\nCPI, year-over-year % change\n2.6 \n%\n2.3 \n%\n2.3 \n%\n2.7 \n%\n2.6 \n%\n2.6 \n%\n2.5 \n%\n2.4 \n%\n2.3 \n%\nPortfolio credit metrics and specific reserves\nCredit metrics are monitored throughout each quarter and are a key consideration in the allowance process. In the fourth quarter of 2024, overall asset quality continued to perform within the Company's expectations. Commercial and investor real estate criticized balances increased approximately $24 million, which included a decrease in classified balances of $192 million compared to the third quarter of 2024. \nNon-performing loans, excluding held for sale, increased approximately $107 million compared to the third quarter of 2024. The increase in non-performing loans was primarily due to credits in previously identified portfolios of interest. The increase in non-performing loans therefore resulted in higher specific reserves in the fourth quarter. See Table 19 for more details regarding non-performing assets. \nQualitative adjustments\nWhile it is the intent of Regions' quantitative allowance methodologies to reflect all risk factors, including incremental risk in portfolios identified as under stress, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. Regions' qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the general imprecision component remained stable as there were no significant changes in the level of uncertainty in the economic scenario or in the models' performance.\nThe qualitative framework also has specific adjustment components which are reserves meant to capture specific issues or events that management believes are not adequately captured in the model outcomes. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Regions maintained qualitative adjustments for certain commercial real estate sectors due to elevated interest rates, vacancy rates and potential declining property values, as well as for certain consumer portfolios where stabilization to historical averages is still anticipated. While qualitative adjustments were maintained in the fourth quarter of 2024, they were reduced from the third quarter of 2024 due to more of the risk being captured in the loss forecasting models and specific reserve estimates, as well as additional portfolio stability resulting in less uncertainty in some portfolios.\n69\nTable of Contents\n \nDetails regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of activity from previous year's totals, are included in Table 17 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\". \nTable 17—Allowance for Credit Losses\nTwelve Months Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nAllowance for loan losses at January 1\n$\n1,576 \n$\n1,464 \n$\n1,479 \nCumulative effect from change in accounting guidance \n(1)\n— \n(38)\n— \nAllowance for loan losses, January 1 (as adjusted for change in accounting guidance) \n(1)\n1,576 \n1,426 \n1,479 \nLoans charged-off:\nCommercial and industrial\n257 \n195 \n102 \nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n4 \n2 \n5 \nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n— \n— \n— \nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n42 \n— \n5 \nResidential first mortgage\n2 \n1 \n1 \nHome equity lines\n3 \n3 \n5 \nHome equity loans\n— \n1 \n1 \nConsumer credit card\n63 \n52 \n40 \nOther consumer—exit portfolios\n1 \n50 \n18 \nOther consumer\n189 \n186 \n198 \n561 \n490 \n375 \nRecoveries of loans previously charged-off:\nCommercial and industrial\n57 \n50 \n47 \nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n2 \n2 \n3 \nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n1 \n— \n— \nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n3 \n— \n2 \nResidential first mortgage\n3 \n1 \n5 \nHome equity lines\n6 \n7 \n12 \nHome equity loans\n— \n1 \n2 \nConsumer credit card\n8 \n8 \n8 \nOther consumer—exit portfolios\n1 \n3 \n5 \nOther consumer\n22 \n21 \n28 \n103 \n93 \n112 \nNet charge-offs (recoveries):\nCommercial and industrial\n200 \n145 \n55 \nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n2 \n— \n2 \nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n(1)\n— \n— \nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n39 \n— \n3 \nResidential first mortgage\n(1)\n— \n(4)\nHome equity lines\n(3)\n(4)\n(7)\nHome equity loans\n— \n— \n(1)\nConsumer credit card\n55 \n44 \n32 \nOther consumer—exit portfolios\n— \n47 \n13 \nOther consumer\n167 \n165 \n170 \n458 \n397 \n263 \nProvision for loan losses\n495 \n547 \n248 \nAllowance for loan losses at December 31\n1,613 \n1,576 \n1,464 \nReserve for unfunded credit commitments at January 1\n124 \n118 \n95 \nProvision for (benefit from) unfunded credit losses\n(8)\n6 \n23 \nReserve for unfunded credit commitments at December 31\n116 \n124 \n118 \nAllowance for credit losses at December 31\n$\n1,729 \n$\n1,700 \n$\n1,582 \nLoans, net of unearned income, outstanding at end of period\n$\n96,727 \n$\n98,379 \n$\n97,009 \nAverage loans, net of unearned income, outstanding for the period\n$\n97,036 \n$\n98,239 \n$\n92,282 \n70\nTable of Contents\n \nTwelve Months Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a % of average loans, annualized \n(2)\n:\nCommercial and industrial\n0.40 \n%\n0.28 \n%\n0.11 \n%\nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n0.04 \n%\n— \n%\n0.04 \n%\nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n(0.18)\n%\n(0.09)\n%\n(0.03)\n%\nTotal commercial\n0.37 \n%\n0.26 \n%\n0.11 \n%\nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n0.60 \n%\n— \n%\n0.06 \n%\nCommercial investor real estate construction\n— \n%\n(0.01)\n%\n— \n%\nTotal investor real estate\n0.45 \n%\n(0.01)\n%\n0.04 \n%\nResidential first mortgage\n(0.01)\n%\n— \n%\n(0.02)\n%\nHome equity lines\n(0.08)\n%\n(0.10)\n%\n(0.19)\n%\nHome equity loans\n(0.02)\n%\n(0.02)\n%\n(0.05)\n%\nConsumer credit card\n4.04 \n%\n3.58 \n%\n2.72 \n%\nOther consumer—exit portfolios\n(3.88)\n%\n12.79 \n%\n1.75 \n%\nOther consumer\n2.71 \n%\n2.74 \n%\n2.99 \n%\nTotal\n0.47 \n%\n0.40 \n%\n0.29 \n%\nRatios \n(2)\n:\nAllowance for credit losses at end of period to loans, net of unearned income \n1.79 \n%\n1.73 \n%\n1.63 \n%\nAllowance for credit losses at end of period to non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale\n186 \n%\n211 \n%\n317 \n%\n_______\n(1)\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n(2)\nAmounts have been calculated using whole dollar values.\nNet charge-offs increased $61 million year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in commercial and industrial and commercial investor real estate mortgage net charge-offs, and partially offset by a decline in net charge-offs in exit portfolios.

The same economic trends that impact net charge-offs, as discussed above, will impact the future level of non-performing loans. Circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility.\n72\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following tables provide an analysis of non-accrual loans (excluding loans held for sale) by portfolio segment: \nTable 20— Analysis of Non-Accrual Loans\n \nNon-Accrual Loans, Excluding Loans Held for Sale for the Year Ended December 31, 2024\n \nCommercial\nInvestor\nReal Estate\nConsumer\n(1)\nTotal\n \n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n515 \n$\n233 \n$\n57 \n$\n805 \nAdditions\n637 \n330 \n— \n967 \nNet payments/other activity\n(374)\n(97)\n(2)\n(473)\nReturn to accrual\n(44)\n— \n— \n(44)\nCharge-offs on non-accrual loans\n(2)\n(251)\n(42)\n— \n(293)\nTransfers to held for sale\n(3)\n(9)\n(1)\n— \n(10)\nNet loan sales\n(24)\n— \n— \n(24)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n450 \n$\n423 \n$\n55 \n$\n928 \n \nNon-Accrual Loans, Excluding Loans Held for Sale for the Year Ended December 31, 2023\n \nCommercial\nInvestor\nReal Estate\nConsumer\n(1)\nTotal\n \n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n382 \n$\n53 \n$\n65 \n$\n500 \nAdditions\n581 \n189 \n— \n770 \nNet payments/other activity\n(145)\n(9)\n(8)\n(162)\nReturn to accrual\n(107)\n— \n— \n(107)\nCharge-offs on non-accrual loans\n(2)\n(188)\n— \n— \n(188)\nTransfers to held for sale\n(3)\n(8)\n— \n— \n(8)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n515 \n$\n233 \n$\n57 \n$\n805 \n________\n(1)\nAll net activity within the consumer portfolio segment other than sales and transfers to held for sale (including related charge-offs) is included as a single net number within the net payments/other activity line.\n(2)\nIncludes charge-offs on loans on non-accrual status and charge-offs taken upon sale and transfer of non-accrual loans to held for sale.\n(3)\nTransfers to held for sale are shown net of charge-offs recorded upon transfer.\nOTHER EARNING ASSETS\nOther earning assets consist primarily of investments in Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock, marketable equity securities, and other miscellaneous earning assets. The balance at December 31, 2024 totaled $1.6 billion, increasing from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase of investments in Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock. Refer to Note 7 \"Other Earning Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS AT FAIR VALUE\nResidential MSRs increased approximately $101 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a bulk purchase of the rights to service $8 billion of residential mortgage loans in the first quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting the increase was higher amortization of servicing rights. An analysis of residential MSRs is presented in Note 6 \"Servicing of Financial Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements. \nOTHER ASSETS\nOther assets increased $646 million to $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to Regions' Early Pay program which provides customers access to their payroll funds up to two days in advance. Also contributing was an increase in a receivable related to the sale of commercial loans held for sale which fluctuates based on the timing of sale and subsequent settlement, as well as an increase in investments in economic development projects.\nDEPOSITS\nRegions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions’ ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company meets customers’ needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services through the Company's digital channels and contact center.\n73\nTable of Contents\n \nDeposits are Regions’ primary source of funds, providing funding for 92 percent of average earning assets in both 2024 and 2023. Table 21 \"Deposits by Category and by Segment\" details year-over-year deposit balance changes on a period-ending basis.  \nThe following table summarizes deposits by category and by segment as of December 31:\nTable 21—Deposits by Category and by Segment\n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nNon-interest-bearing demand\n$\n39,138 \n$\n42,368 \nInterest-bearing checking\n25,079 \n24,480 \nSavings\n12,022 \n12,604 \nMoney market—domestic\n35,644 \n33,364 \nTime deposits\n15,720 \n14,972 \n$\n127,603 \n$\n127,788 \nConsumer Bank segment\n$\n78,637 \n$\n80,031 \nCorporate Bank segment\n38,361 \n36,883 \nWealth Management segment\n7,736 \n7,694 \nOther\n(1)\n2,869 \n3,180 \n$\n127,603 \n$\n127,788 \n____\n(1)   Other deposits represent non-customer balances primarily consisting of wholesale funding (for example, selected deposits and brokered time deposits). Other deposits include brokered deposits totaling $2.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2023.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2024 decreased approximately $185 million compared to year-end 2023 levels. Growth in corporate and wealth deposits were overcome by declines in consumer and other deposits. As expected, deposit balances were further impacted by the remixing experienced in 2023, albeit at a slower pace. Non-interest-bearing demand and savings accounts that provide a lower or no interest rate decreased in 2024 while categories that provide a higher interest rate to customers, such as money market and time deposits, grew in 2024. The pace of remixing slowed in the second half of 2024 as competitive rates declined ahead of the reduction in the Fed funds rate in the third quarter and continued with 2 additional rate cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024. Overall the non-interest-bearing mix has remained mostly stable at approximately 31 percent of total deposits at year-end 2024 compared to 33 percent at year-end 2023. \nThe deposit mix influenced an increase in deposit costs to 156 basis points for 2024, compared to 99 basis points for 2023. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 228 basis points for 2024 compared to 156 basis points for 2023. See the “Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk” section for further discussion of these balances. \nRegions' deposits are granular and diversified including insured and collateralized deposits, with consumer deposits making up more than 62 percent of the total deposit base. Furthermore, corporate deposits include those that are operational in nature (where the primary use is certain operational services such as clearing, custody, payments or other cash management activities). A significant amount of the Company's deposit base is insured by the FDIC or collateralized, with approximately $10.7 billion in deposits collateralized in public funds or in trusts at December 31, 2024. The amount of estimated uninsured deposits totaled $49.9 billion at December 31, 2024, therefore over 60 percent of total deposits were insured by the FDIC. The granularity of the Company's deposits was also evidenced by an average deposit account balance of approximately $18 thousand at December 31, 2024. The estimates of uninsured deposits and average account size were based on methodologies used in the Company's Call Report, which is prepared on an unconsolidated bank basis.\nSee the \"Liquidity\" and \"Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk\" sections for further discussion on liquidity and interest rates.\nTime deposit accounts with balances of $250,000 or more totaled $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe following table shows scheduled maturities of estimated uninsured time deposits as of December 31, 2024:\nTable 22—Maturity of Uninsured Time Deposits \n2024\n \n(In millions)\nUninsured time deposits, maturing in:\n3 months or less\n$\n726 \nOver 3 through 6 months\n630 \nOver 6 through 12 months\n155 \nOver 12 months\n94 \n$\n1,605 \n74\nTable of Contents\n \nBORROWED FUNDS\nTotal short-term borrowings increased from zero at December 31, 2023 to $500 million at December 31, 2024 due to the use of FHLB advances. The levels of these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the Company's funding needs and the sources utilized. Short-term secured borrowings, such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances, are a portion of Regions' funding strategy. See the \"Liquidity\" section for further detail of Regions' borrowing capacity with the FHLB.\nTotal long-term borrowings increased approximately $3.7 billion to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2024 due to the use of FHLB borrowings and debt issuances during the second and third quarters of 2024. \nSee Note 11 \"Borrowed Funds\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of both short-term and long-term borrowings. \nRATINGS\n    Table 23 \"Credit Ratings\" reflects the debt ratings information of Regions Financial Corporation and Regions Bank by S&P, Moody’s, Fitch and DBRS.\nTable 23—Credit Ratings\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n \nS&P\nMoody’s\nFitch\nDBRS \n(1)\nRegions Financial Corporation\nSenior unsecured debt\nBBB+\nBaa1\nA-\nA\nSubordinated debt\nBBB\nBaa1\nBBB+\nWR\nRegions Bank\nShort-term \nA-2\nP-1\nF1\nR-1M\nLong-term bank deposits \nN/A\nA1\nA\nAH\nSenior unsecured debt\nA-\nBaa1\nA-\nAH\nSubordinated debt\nBBB+\nBaa1\nBBB+\nA\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nStable\n____\n(1)    As of March 31, 2024, DBRS withdrew their rating on Regions Financial Corporation's subordinated debt.\nOn September 16, 2024, Moody's affirmed the Company's senior unsecured debt rating and revised its outlook to stable from negative citing its very strong deposit franchise, sound profitability and conservative asset risk profile.\nIn general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions’ access to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity, collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting Regions’ financial condition and liquidity. See “Risk Factors” for more information.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.\nSHAREHOLDERS' AND TOTAL EQUITY\nShareholders’ equity was $17.9 billion at December 31, 2024 as compared to $17.4 billion at December 31, 2023. During 2024, net income increased shareholders' equity by $1.9 billion, cash dividends on common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $895 million. Cash dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholders' equity by $104 million. Changes in AOCI decreased shareholders' equity by $116 million, primarily due to available for sale securities and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company issued Series F preferred stock, which increased shareholders' equity by $489 million and redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock, which decreased shareholders' equity by $500 million. Common stock repurchased during 2024 decreased shareholders' equity by $348 million. These shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock. The cumulative effect from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to the accounting for tax credit investments decreased shareholders' equity by $5 million. See Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements for information.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, the Company purchased 3.4 million shares for approximately $82 million through February 20, 2025. These shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock.\n75\nTable of Contents\n \nTotal equity included noncontrolling interest of $31 million and $64 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The noncontrolling interest represents the unowned portion of a low income housing tax credit fund syndication, of which Regions held the majority interest at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nSee Note 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" section for additional information.\nREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS \nCAPITAL RULES\nRegions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. Regions is a \"Category IV\" institution under the Federal Reserve's Tailoring Rules. \nFederal banking agencies allowed a phase-in of the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. At December 31, 2021, the add-back to regulatory capital was calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. The amount is phased-in over a three-year period beginning in 2022 and will conclude in the first quarter of 2025. At December 31, 2024, the net impact of the addback on CET1 was approximately $102 million or approximately 8 basis points. \nRegions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding CCAR results.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, proposals were issued by the U.S federal banking regulators that, if adopted, would impact the Company related to long-term debt requirements and U.S. implementation of capital requirements under Basel IV rules, more recently referred to as the Basel III \"Endgame\". The Company is studying the proposals and evaluating their impacts. Additional discussion of the Basel III Rules, their applicability to Regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the \"Supervision and Regulation\" subsection of the \"Business\" section.\nAdditional discussion and a tabular presentation of the applicable holding company and bank regulatory capital requirements is included in Note 12 \"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nLIQUIDITY\nRegions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals and regulatory expectations. The framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with Regions’ Liquidity Management Policy and the Liquidity Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board. Processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. While the framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are further tailored to be commensurate with Regions’ operating model and risk profile.\n See the “Supervision and Regulation—Liquidity Regulation” subsection of the “Business” section, the \"Risk Factors\" section and the \"Liquidity\" section for more information.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nRegions is exposed to various risks as part of the normal course of operations. The exposure to risk requires sound risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of programs and processes that apply to the entire Company. Accordingly, Regions has established a risk management framework to manage risks and provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives.\nThe primary risk exposures identified and managed through the Company’s risk management framework are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, legal risk, compliance risk, reputational risk and strategic risk.\n•\nMarket risk is the risk to the Company’s financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices.\n•\nLiquidity risk is the potential that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding (referred to as \"funding liquidity risk\") or the potential that the \n76\nTable of Contents\n \nCompany cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (referred to as \"market liquidity risk\").\n•\nCredit risk is the risk that arises from the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation.\n•\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.\n•\nLegal risk is defined as the risk associated with the failure to meet Regions' legal obligations from legislative, regulatory, or contractual perspectives.\n•\nCompliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards.\n•\nReputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding the Company’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.\n•\nStrategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment.\nSeveral of these primary risk exposures are expanded upon further within the remaining sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nRegions’ risk management framework outlines the Company’s approach for managing risk that includes the following four components:\n•\nCollaborative Risk Culture\n - A strong, collaborative risk culture is fundamental to the Company's core values and operating principles. It ensures focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within the bounds of the Company’s risk appetite. The Company's risk culture requires that risks be promptly identified, escalated, and challenged; thereby, benefiting the overall performance of the Company. Sustaining a collaborative risk culture is critical to the Company's success and is a clear expectation of executive management and the Board.\n•\nSound Risk Appetite\n - The Company's risk appetite statements define the types and levels of risk the Company is willing to take to achieve its objectives.\n•\nSustainable Risk Processes\n - Effective risk management requires sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report risk.\n•\nResponsible Risk Governance \n- Governance serves as the foundation for comprehensive management of risks facing the Company. It outlines clear responsibility and accountability for managing, monitoring, escalating, and reporting both existing and emerging risks.\nClearly defined roles and responsibilities are critical to the effective management of risk and are central to the four components of the Company’s approach to risk management. Regions utilizes the Three Lines of Defense concept to clearly designate risk management activities within the Company.\n•\n1st Line of Defense activities include the proactive identification, management (including mitigation and risk acceptance), and ownership of risks.\n•\n2nd Line of Defense activities provide for objective oversight of the Company’s risk-taking activities and assessment of the Company’s aggregate risk levels.\n•\n3rd Line of Defense activities provide for independent reviews and assessments of risk management practices across the Company.\nThe Board provides the highest level of risk management governance. The principal risk management functions of the Board are to oversee processes for evaluating the adequacy of internal controls, risk management, financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. The Board has designated an Audit Committee of outside directors to focus on oversight of management's establishment and maintenance of appropriate disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting. See the \"Financial Disclosures and Internal Controls\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information. The Board has also designated a Risk Committee of outside directors to focus on Regions’ overall risk profile. The Risk Committee annually approves an Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement that reflects core business principles and strategic vision by including quantitative limits and qualitative statements that are organized by risk type. This statement is designed to be a high-level document that sets the tone for the Board’s risk appetite, which is the maximum amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives. By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its shareholders, regulators, customers and other stakeholders, the Company’s risk appetite is aligned with its strategic priorities and goals.\n77\nTable of Contents\n \nThe Risk Management Group, led by the Company’s Chief Risk Officer, ensures the consistent application of Regions’ risk management approach within the structure of the Company’s operating, capital and strategic plans. The primary activities of the Risk Management Group include:\n•\nInterpreting internal and external signals that point to possible risk issues for the Company;\n•\nIdentifying risks and determining which Company areas and/or products will be affected;\n•\nEnsuring there are mechanisms in place to specifically determine how risks will affect the Company as a whole and the individual area and or product;\n•\nAssisting business groups in analyzing trends and ensuring Company areas have appropriate risk identification and mitigation processes in place; and\n•\nReviewing the limits, parameters, policies, and procedures in place to ensure the continued appropriateness of risk controls.\nAs part of its ongoing assessment process, the Risk Management Group makes recommendations to management and the Risk Committee of the Board regarding adjustments to these controls as conditions or risk tolerances change. In addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of the Company’s internal control structure and related systems and processes.\nManagement, with the assistance of the Risk Management Group, follows a formal process for identifying, measuring and documenting key risks facing each business group and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated, as well as how the controls can be monitored to ensure they are effective. The Risk Committee receives reports from management to ensure operations are within the limits established by the Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement.\nSome of the more significant processes used by management to manage and control risks are described in the remainder of this report.  External factors beyond management’s control may result in losses despite the Risk Management Group’s efforts.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation. While the implications differ for a bank, inflation does have influence on the growth of total assets and deposits in the banking industry and the resulting level of profitability and capitalization. Inflation also affects the level of market interest rates, and therefore, the pricing of financial instruments.\nManagement believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of Regions’ ability to manage the impact of changes in interest rates. The Company’s interest rate risk positioning was mostly neutral as of December 31, 2024, and therefore, net interest income increases or declines only modestly from higher or lower interest rates. Hedging activity has reduced the exposure to net interest income late in the rising interest rate cycle as intended. Refer to Table 24 \"Interest Rate Sensitivity\" for additional details on Regions’ interest rate sensitivity.\nAdditionally, inflation has the potential to impact credit risk. Periods of inflation could influence asset prices and business input costs which could affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans. The Company has sound credit risk management practices to maintain a credit portfolio through the economic cycle. Refer to the \"Credit Risk\" section for further details on Regions' credit risk management process. \nEFFECTS OF DEFLATION\nA period of deflation would affect all industries, including financial institutions. Deflation potentially could lead to lower profits, higher unemployment, lower production and deterioration in overall economic conditions. In addition, deflation could depress economic activity and impair bank earnings through reduced balance sheet growth and less favorable product pricing, as well as impairment in the ability of borrowers to repay loans. \nManagement believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on financial results relates to Regions’ ability to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to cushion against future market and credit related losses. However, the Company can utilize certain risk management tools to help it maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to develop.\nMARKET RISK—INTEREST RATE RISK \nRegions’ primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company offers. As its primary tool to analyze this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of Regions’ interest rate risk.\n78\nTable of Contents\n \nIn addition to net interest income simulations, Regions also utilizes an EVE analysis as a measurement tool to estimate risk exposure over a longer-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. Importantly, EVE values only the current balance sheet, excluding the growth assumptions used in net interest income sensitivity analyses. Additionally, the results are highly dependent on assumptions for products with embedded prepay optionality and indeterminate maturities. The uncertainty surrounding important assumptions used in EVE analysis may limit its efficacy.\nSensitivity Measurement\n—Financial simulation models are Regions’ primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions’ balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and magnitude of interest rate movements, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior.\nThe primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity, Regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using “market forward rates.” The set of alternative interest rate scenarios includes instantaneous parallel rate shifts of various magnitudes. In addition to parallel rate shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements.\nExposure to Interest Rate Movements\n—Regions' balance sheet is naturally asset sensitive, with net interest income  increasing with higher interest rates, and decreasing with lower interest rates. This is the result of approximately half of the loan portfolio floating contractually with market rate indices, and funding from a large, mostly stable retail deposit portfolio.  Importantly, the stability and rate sensitivity of Regions' deposit portfolio has been proven over multiple interest rate cycles. With this natural balance sheet profile, the ability to utilize discretionary asset duration strategies within the investment portfolio and through derivative hedges is critical in mitigating the Bank’s naturally asset sensitive position. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Regions evidenced a mostly balanced, or \"neutral\" asset/liability position, with an asset duration of approximately 2.5 years and a liability duration of approximately 2.4 years, using historically-informed approximations. While the derivative hedging portfolio and securities portfolio have been recorded on the balance sheet at an unrealized loss, deposit value increases more than offset this loss during the rising rate cycle. The additional value of deposits in a higher rate environment is realized in the form of lower-cost funding when compared with wholesale sources. While balance sheet analysis, particularly EVE analysis, does contemplate the economic value of deposits, the estimated fair value of deposits is equal to their carrying value for certain financial statement footnote disclosures, consistent with industry practices. See Note 21 \"Fair Value Measurements\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRecently, pay-fixed fair value hedges and securities transfers from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity classification have been used to reduce AOCI volatility associated with unrealized securities gains and losses. Inclusive of these activities, the total securities portfolio duration is 4.5 years, the available-for-sale securities portfolio duration is 4.2 years, and the held-to-maturity securities portfolio duration is 5.9 years. As pay-fixed fair value hedges are further utilized to manage AOCI volatility, receive-fixed cash flow hedges may be entered as an offset to preserve Regions’ interest rate sensitivity.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, Regions' net interest income profile was mostly neutral to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending December 2025. The estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in Table 24 below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. An increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate, the interest rate on reserve balances, and SOFR) will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower. In either scenario, it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will offset the change in asset yields, resulting in little change to net interest income.\nNet interest income remains exposed to intermediate and long-term yield curve tenors. While this was a headwind to net interest income during a low rate environment, it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth given higher interest rates today. Elevated, or increasing intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swaps and mortgage rates) will drive yields higher on certain fixed-rate, newly originated or renewed loans, and increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases. The opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest rates fall.  Additionally, shifts in the long end of the yield curve will impact securities prepayments and alter the amount of discount accretion and premium amortization in any given period.\n79\nTable of Contents\n \nThe interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in Table 24 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated with monetary policy on industry liquidity levels and the cost of that liquidity, management evaluates the impacts from these key assumptions through sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered predictive of future results.\nThe Company’s baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best estimate for balance sheet changes in the coming 12 months. Deposit balances and mix have mostly reverted to normal historical patterns and trends. Additional deposit balance outflow of $1 billion would reduce net interest income by $19 million over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario in Table 24. Conversely, if an additional $1 billion are retained, a positive benefit of $19 million would be expected over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario in Table 24.\nIn rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Currently, however, much of the anticipated mix shift has already occurred or is expected to occur within the baseline scenario, mitigating the amount of additional remixing in higher rate scenarios. The magnitude of the remixing shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $1.1 billion over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario in Table 24. Furthermore, over the 12 month horizon, an increase of $1 billion in deposit remixing would decrease net interest income by approximately $24 million, and a decrease of $1 billion in deposit remixing would increase net interest income by $24 million in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario.\nThe interest-bearing deposit beta is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles and is dynamic across both interest rate level and time. The parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point shock scenario in Table 24 incorporates an incremental beta between 40 and 45 percent when compared to the base case scenario, while the parallel, instantaneous -100 basis point shock scenario incorporates an incremental beta between 35 and 40 percent when compared to the base case scenario. Incremental deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of 5 percent in a parallel, instantaneous 100 basis point shock would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately $43 million.\nThe table below summarizes Regions' positioning over the next 12 months in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. More information regarding hedges is disclosed in Table 25 and its accompanying description.  \nTable 24—Interest Rate Sensitivity \nEstimated Annual Change\nin Net Interest Income\nDecember 31, 2024\n(1)(2)\n \n(In millions)\nGradual Change in Interest Rates\n+ 200 basis points\n$\n46 \n+ 100 basis points\n27 \n - 100 basis points\n(41)\n - 200 basis points\n(80)\nInstantaneous Change in Interest Rates\n+ 200 basis points\n$\n(36)\n+ 100 basis points\n(9)\n- 100 basis points\n(24)\n - 200 basis points\n(49)\n________\n(1)\nDisclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12-month forward looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing.\n(2)\nActive hedges, including forward starting hedges, are included in the sensitivity analysis to the extent that they fall within the measurement horizon.\nRegions' comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses derivatives and debt securities to manage its interest rate risk position. \nInterest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions’ securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders’ equity.\nDerivatives\n—Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions’ senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit, and foreign exchange risks. The most common derivatives Regions \n80\nTable of Contents\n \nemploys are forward rate contracts, forward sale commitments, futures contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate options (caps, floors and collars), and contracts with a combination of these instruments. \nForward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. Futures contracts subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform.\nRegions has made use of interest rate swaps and options in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position to a variable-rate position, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variable-rate position, and to effectively convert a portion of its floating-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing. \nThe following table presents additional information about hedging interest rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk:\nTable 25—Hedging Derivatives by Interest Rate Risk Management Strategy\nDecember 31, 2024\nNotional\nAmount\nWeighted-Average \nMaturity (Years)\nReceive Rate\nPay Rate\n(Dollars in millions)\nDerivatives in fair value hedging relationships:\nReceive variable/pay fixed swaps - debt securities available for sale\n(1)(2)(3)\n$\n2,334 \n5.2 \n4.4 \n%\n4.0 \n%\nReceive fixed/pay variable swaps - borrowings and time deposits\n(3)\n3,150 \n4.9 \n2.3 \n%\n4.3 \n%\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationships:\nReceive fixed/pay variable swaps - floating-rate loans\n(1)(2)(3)\n$\n36,660 \n3.2 \n3.1 \n%\n4.3 \n%\n   Interest rate options\n(4)\n2,000 \n3.5 \nTotal derivatives designated as hedging instruments\n$\n44,144 \n_________\n(1)\nFloating rates represent the most recent fixing for active derivatives and the first forward fixing for future starting derivatives.  \n(2)\nIncludes forward starting notional with maturity relative to current quarter-end. For more information on notional by year, see Table 26.\n(3)\nAll floating rates are SOFR based and may include SOFR conversion spread. \n(4)\nInterest rate options have an average cap strike of  6.22% and a floor of  1.86%. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company added $3.0 billion in forward-starting interest rate swaps (floating rate loan hedges) with a receive rate of 3.6 percent, which will become active in both July 2026 and July 2028 and mature in July 2031. The Company also added $2.0 billion in pay-fixed interest rate swaps (AFS securities hedges) with an average pay rate of 3.9 percent and an average maturity in 2030 to reduce AOCI volatility in the AFS securities portfolio. As an offset to the interest rate risk associated with these pay-fixed fair value hedges, the Company added $2.0 billion in spot-starting receive-fixed interest rate swaps (floating rate loan hedges) with an average receive rate of 3.8 percent and an average maturity in 2030. Cash flow swaps (floating rate loan hedges) typically have a different day count convention than fair value swaps (AFS securities hedges), resulting in a lower fixed rate.\n81\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table presents the average asset hedge notional amounts that are active during each of the remaining quarterly and annual periods. \nTable 26—Schedule of Notional for Asset Hedging Derivatives\nAverage Active Notional Amount\nQuarter Ended\nYears Ended\n12/31/2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n(In millions)\nAsset Hedging Relationships:\nReceive fixed/pay variable swaps\n$\n19,421 \n$\n20,998 \n$\n20,175 \n$\n18,707 \n$\n14,177 \n$\n9,226 \n$\n7,850 \n$\n3,228 \n$\n470 \n$\n350 \n$\n217 \nReceive variable/pay fixed swaps\n803 \n2,310 \n2,259 \n2,025 \n1,721 \n1,363 \n623 \n623 \n472 \n350 \n217 \nNet receive fixed/pay variable swaps\n$\n18,618 \n$\n18,688 \n$\n17,916 \n$\n16,682 \n$\n12,456 \n$\n7,863 \n$\n7,227 \n$\n2,605 \n$\n(2)\n$\n— \n$\n— \nInterest rate options\n$\n1,500 \n$\n1,999 \n$\n2,000 \n$\n2,000 \n$\n999 \n$\n1 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n_________\n(1)\nActive hedges, including forward-starting hedges, are included in the sensitivity levels disclosed in Table 24 to the extent that they fall within the measurement horizon.\nRegions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. Most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The “Credit Risk” section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk.\nRegions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe primary objective of Regions’ hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of Regions’ execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. \nSee Note 20 \"Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions’ year-end derivatives positions and further discussion.\nRegions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of Regions’ current portfolio.\nLIQUIDITY \nLiquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions’ ability to meet the needs of the Company and its customers. Regions’ goal in liquidity management is to maintain diverse liquidity sources and reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. Accordingly, Regions maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations, as further described below. See also Note 23 \"Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Company’s funding requirements. Furthermore, Regions performs specific procedures, including scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk. \n Regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans, and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. Maturities in the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by Regions' deposit base. \n82\nTable of Contents\n \nCash reserves, liquid assets and secured borrowing capabilities aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed conditions, and/or meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations related to potential litigation. As part of its normal management practice, Regions maintains collateral and operational readiness to utilize secured funding sources such as the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank on a same-day basis (subject to any practical constraints affecting these market participants). While the securities portfolio is a primary source of liquidity, the secured borrowing capabilities, in addition to cash reserves on hand, assist in alleviating the Company's need to sell securities for funding purposes. Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in national money markets, though Regions does maintain limits on short-term unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such markets. \nThe following table summarizes the Company's available sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2024:\nTable 27—Liquidity Sources\nAvailability as of December 31, 2024\n(In billions)\nCash at the Federal Reserve Bank\n(1)\n$\n7.8 \nUnencumbered investment securities\n(2)\n23.1\nFHLB borrowing availability\n10.2\nFederal Reserve Bank borrowing availability through the discount window\n21.6\nTotal liquidity sources\n$\n62.7 \n____\n(1)  Includes small in transit items that may not yet be reflected in the Federal Reserve Bank master account closing balance. \n(2)  Unencumbered investment securities comprise securities that are eligible as collateral for secured transactions through market channels or are eligible to be pledged to the FHLB, the Federal Reserve discount window, or the Standing Repo Facility.\nThe balance with the Federal Reserve Bank is the primary component of the balance sheet line item “interest-bearing deposits in other banks.” At December 31, 2024, Regions had approximately $7.8 billion in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and other depository institutions, an increase from approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, 2023, driven by incremental secured and unsecured borrowing to optimize liquidity.\nThe securities portfolio also serves as a primary source and storehouse of liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 3 \"Debt Securities\" to the consolidated financial statements). Furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the available for sale securities portfolio (for example, the agency guaranteed MBS portfolio) can be readily used as a source of cash through various secured borrowing arrangements. Regions' securities portfolio consists of residential and commercial agency MBS, U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency securities, and corporate and other debt. In evaluating the liquidity within the securities portfolio, unencumbered investment securities are primarily comprised of U.S Treasury securities and residential and commercial agency MBS. Unencumbered investment securities also includes certain corporate bonds considered to be highly liquid and other securities, primarily non-agency commercial MBS.\nRegions’ financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in managing the Company's liquidity position. As of December 31, 2024, Regions had $500 million in short-term FHLB borrowings, $2.0 billion in long-term FHLB borrowings and had borrowing capacity as shown in Table 27. FHLB borrowing capacity was determined based on eligible securities and loan amounts, as of December 31, 2024, that were pledged as collateral for future borrowing capacity. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding.\nRegions has additional borrowing availability with the Federal Reserve Bank through the discount window as shown in Table 27. Federal Reserve Bank borrowing capacity is determined based on eligible loan amounts that were pledged as collateral for future borrowing capacity. Also through the Federal Reserve Bank, Regions is an eligible Standing Repo Facility counterparty, which supplements Regions' available channels for monetizing unencumbered securities.\nRegions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, Regions' Board has authorized Regions Bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. Refer to Note 11 \"Borrowed Funds\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nRegions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. See Note 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nRegions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the holding company exceeded minimums and totaled $2.4 billion at December 31, 2024. Overall liquidity risk limits are established by the \n83\nTable of Contents\n \nBoard through its Risk Appetite Statement and Liquidity Policy. The Company's Board, LROC and ALCO regularly review compliance with the established limits.\nMARKET RISK—PREPAYMENT RISK \nRegions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments. Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income. For example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a borrower, so that the borrower may refinance its obligations at lower rates. As loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce Regions’ interest income and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. Prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. Regions’ greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its MBS portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the residential MSR, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements. Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the U.S. Government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market. Such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors. The Company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. Further, Regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income on the residential MSRs. Regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management.\nCREDIT RISK\nRegions’ objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. Regions has various processes to manage credit risk as described below. In order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio, Regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. See the \"Portfolio Characteristics\" section found earlier in this report for further information regarding the risk characteristics of each loan type. \nManagement Process\nCredit risk is managed by maintaining a sound credit risk culture, throughout all lines of defense, which ensures that the levels and types of risk taken are aligned with Regions' credit risk appetite.  The credit quality of borrowers and counterparties has a significant impact on Regions' earnings; however, the nature of the risk differs by each of the defined businesses which engage in multiple forms of commercial, investor real estate and consumer lending.  Regions categorizes the credit risks it faces by asset quality, counterparty exposure, and diversification levels which provides a structure to assess credit risk and guides credit decision-making.  Credit policies, another key component of Regions' culture, are designed and adjusted, as needed, to promote sound credit risk management. These policies guide lending activities in a manner consistent with Regions' strategy and provide a framework for achieving asset quality and earnings objectives.  \nEffective credit risk management requires coordinated identification, measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of credit risk exposure, credit quality, and emerging risk trends. Accordingly, Regions has implemented a credit risk governance structure that provides oversight from the Board to the organizational units in order to maintain open channels of communication.\nOccasionally, borrowers and counterparties do not fulfill their obligations and Regions must take steps to mitigate and manage losses.  Teams are in place to appropriately identify and manage nonperforming loans, collections, loan modifications, and loss mitigation efforts. Regions maintains an allowance for credit losses that management considers adequate to absorb expected losses in the portfolio.\nFor a discussion of the process and methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses refer to the “Critical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies” section found earlier in this report, Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements. Details regarding the allowance for credit losses, including an analysis of activity from the previous year’s total, are included in Table 17 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\". Also, refer to Table 18 \"Allowance Allocation\" for details pertaining to management’s allocation of the allowance to each loan category.\nResponsibility and accountability for effectively managing all risks, including credit risk, in the various business units lies with the first line of defense. Risk Management, in the second line of defense, oversees, assesses and effectively challenges the risk-taking activities of the first line of defense. Finally, Credit Risk Review provides ongoing oversight, as a third line of defense function, of the credit portfolios to ensure Regions’ activities, and controls, are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk profile of the Company.\n84\nTable of Contents\n \nCounterparty Risk\nCounterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction or contract could be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual or legal obligations. Exposure may be to a financial institution (such as a commercial bank, an insurance company, a broker dealer, etc.) or a corporate client.\nRegions has a centralized approach to approval, management, and monitoring of counterparty exposure. The Counterparty Risk Management Group is responsible for the independent credit risk management of financial institution counterparties and their affiliates. Market Risk Management is responsible for the measurement and stress testing of counterparty exposures. The Corporate and Commercial Credit groups are responsible for the independent credit risk management of client side counterparties.\nFinancial institution exposure may result from a variety of transaction types generated in one or more departments of the Company. Aggregate exposure limits are established to manage the exposure generated by various areas of the Company. Counterparty client credit risk arises when Regions sells a risk management product to hedge risks in the client’s business. Exposures to counterparties are aggregated across departments and regularly reported to senior management.\nINFORMATION SECURITY RISK\nRegions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber-attacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in attempts to compromise or disable information systems. In the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, Regions may be required to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs, costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event. \nSee Part I,",

Regions’ process for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks facing each of its functions and areas, how those risks are controlled or mitigated, and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are in place and effective. These risks, control procedures and monitoring tools are documented in a standard format. This format not only documents the internal control structures over all significant accounts, but also places responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure that controls are effective.\nRegions also has processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. These controls and procedures as defined by the SEC are generally designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in reports filed with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nRegions’ Disclosure Review Committee, which includes representatives from the legal, tax, finance, risk management, accounting, investor relations, and treasury departments, meets quarterly to review recent internal and external events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the CEO and CFO meet quarterly with the SEC Filings Review Committee, which includes senior representatives from accounting, legal, risk management, treasury, and the business groups. The SEC Filings Review Committee provides a forum in which senior executives disclose to the CEO and CFO any known significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in Regions’ internal controls over financial reporting, and provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements and other contents of the Company’s Form 10-K and 10-Q filings are accurate, complete, and timely. As part of this process, certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from Regions’ associates who are responsible for maintaining and monitoring effective internal controls over financial reporting. These certifications are reviewed and presented to the CEO and CFO as support of the Company’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. The Form 10-K is presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for approval, and the Forms 10-Q are reviewed by the Audit Committee. Financial results and other financial information are also reviewed with the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.\nAs required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the CEO and the CFO review and make certifications regarding the accuracy of Regions’ periodic public reports filed with the SEC, as well as the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. With the assistance of the financial review committees noted in the previous paragraph, Regions continually assesses and monitors disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and makes refinements as necessary.\nCOMPARISON OF 2023 WITH 2022\nRefer to the “2023 Results” and \"Operating Results\" sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for comparisons of 2023 with 2022.\n85\nTable of Contents\n \nItem 7A.  \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThis information is set forth in the Risk Management section of Item 7 and is incorporated herein by reference.\n86\nTable of Contents\n \nItem 8.  \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nWe, as members of the Management of Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”), are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Regions’ internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.\nAll internal controls systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements in the Company’s financial statements, including the possibility of circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nRegions’ management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in its 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe and assert that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nRegions’ independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive  income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the  period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.   \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  \n \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s  internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are  recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made  only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n                        \nBirmingham, Alabama\nFebruary 21, 2025\n88\nTable of Contents\n \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Regions Financial Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  \nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates. \n89\nTable of Contents\n \nAllowance for credit losses\nDescription of the Matter\nThe Company’s loan and lease portfolio and the associated allowance for credit losses (ACL), were $96.7 billion and $1.73 billion as of December 31, 2024, respectively. The provision for credit losses was $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the ACL is established to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loans measured at amortized cost, including unfunded commitments. Management’s measurement of expected losses is driven by loss forecasting models which utilize relevant quantitative information about historical experience, current conditions and the reasonable and supportable economic forecast that affects the collectability of the reported amount. Management’s estimate for the expected credit losses is established through these quantitative factors, as well as qualitative considerations to account for the imprecision inherent in the estimation process. As a result, management may adjust the ACL for the potential impact of qualitative factors through their established framework. Management’s qualitative framework provides for specific model and general imprecision adjustments for such factors as the economic forecast imprecision, potential model imprecision, process imprecision and specific issues or events that Management believes are not adequately captured in the modeled outcomes. \nAuditing management’s ACL estimate and related provision for credit losses involved a high degree of complexity in evaluating the expected loss forecasting models and subjectivity in evaluating management’s measurement of the economic forecast used during the reasonable and supportable period and the qualitative factors. \nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls for establishing the ACL, including: 1) expected loss forecasting models including model validation, monitoring, the completeness and accuracy of key inputs and assumptions used in the models; 2) the development and application of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast; 3) the identification and measurement of qualitative factors.\nWith respect to expected loss forecasting models, with the support of specialists, we evaluated the conceptual soundness of the model methodology and replicated a sample of models. We also tested the appropriateness of key inputs and assumptions used in these models by agreeing a sample of inputs to supporting information. \nRegarding the reasonable and supportable economic forecast, with the support of specialists, we assessed the forecasted economic scenario by, among other procedures, evaluating management’s methodology for developing the forecast and comparing a sample of key economic variables developed to external sources.\n  \nWith respect to the identification of qualitative factors, we evaluated the potential impact of imprecision in the quantitative models and hence the need to consider a qualitative adjustment to the ACL for factors which may not be directly measured in the modeled calculations. Regarding measurement of the qualitative factors, with the support of specialists, we evaluated the methodology applied and data utilized by management to estimate the appropriate level of the qualitative factors. We also considered if qualitative adjustments were consistent with external macroeconomic factors and the results produced by the Company’s Credit Review, Internal Audit and Model Validation groups. \nWe evaluated the overall ACL amount, including model estimates and qualitative factor adjustments, and whether the recorded ACL appropriately reflects expected credit losses on the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments. We reviewed historical loss statistics, peer-bank information, subsequent events and transactions and considered whether they corroborate or contradict the Company’s measurement of the ACL. \n  /s/

\nREGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \nRegions Financial Corporation (“Regions” or the “Company”) provides a full range of banking and bank-related services to individual and corporate customers through its subsidiaries and branch offices located across the South, Midwest and Texas as well as delivering specialty capabilities nationwide. Regions is subject to the regulations of certain government agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by certain of those regulatory authorities.\nThe accounting and reporting policies of Regions and the methods of applying those policies that materially affect the consolidated financial statements conform with GAAP and with general financial services industry practices. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the consolidated financial statements including, but not limited to, the estimates and assumptions related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurements, intangibles, MSRs measured at fair value and income taxes. \nRegions has evaluated all subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring 2024, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to several topics, as disclosed below in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section. All prior period amounts impacted by guidance that required retrospective application have been revised.\nCertain amounts in prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, except as otherwise noted. These reclassifications are immaterial and have no effect on net income, comprehensive income (loss), total assets, total liabilities, total shareholders’ equity or cash flows as previously reported.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regions, its subsidiaries and certain VIEs. Significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Regions considers a voting rights entity to be a subsidiary and consolidates it if Regions has a controlling financial interest in the entity. VIEs are consolidated if Regions has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that significantly impact financial performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., Regions is the primary beneficiary). The determination of whether Regions is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is reassessed on an ongoing basis. Investments in companies which are not VIEs but in which Regions has more than minor influence over the operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in VIEs, where Regions is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, are accounted for using either the proportional amortization method or the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets. The maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding balance, future funding commitments and any related loans to the entity. Loans to these entities are underwritten in substantially the same manner as are other loans and are generally secured. Refer to Note 2  for additional disclosures regarding Regions’ significant VIEs.\nCASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH FLOWS\nCash equivalents represent assets that can be converted into cash immediately.  At Regions, these assets include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Cash flows from loans, either originated or acquired, are classified at that time according to management’s intent to either sell or hold the loan for the foreseeable future. When management’s intent is to sell the loan, the cash flows of that loan are presented as operating cash flows. When management’s intent is to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, the cash flows of that loan are presented as investing cash flows.\n96\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table summarizes supplemental cash flow information for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nCash paid during the period for:\nInterest on deposits and borrowed funds\n$\n2,219\n \n$\n1,441\n \n$\n303\n \nIncome taxes, net\n64\n \n376\n \n336\n \nNon-cash transfers:\nSecurities transferred to held to maturity from available for sale \n(1)\n3,763\n \n—\n \n—\n \nLoans held for sale and loans transferred to other real estate\n20\n \n21\n \n21\n \nLoans transferred to loans held for sale\n18\n \n15\n \n22\n \nLoans held for sale transferred to loans\n10\n \n18\n \n24\n \nProperties transferred to held for sale\n8\n \n79\n \n6\n \n___\n(1)   Represents the carrying value of securities transferred in the period. \nSECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions. It is Regions’ policy to take possession of securities purchased under resell agreements either through direct delivery or a tri-party agreement.\nDEBT SECURITIES\nManagement determines the appropriate accounting classification of debt securities at the time of purchase, based on intent, and periodically re-evaluates such designations. Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Debt securities held to maturity are presented at amortized cost. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale and may be sold prior to maturity. Debt securities available for sale are presented at estimated fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). See the “Fair Value Measurements” section below for discussion of determining fair value.\nThe amortized cost of debt securities classified as held to maturity and available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or first call date when applicable, using the effective interest method. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income on securities. Realized gains and losses are included in net securities gains (losses). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.\nFor debt securities available for sale, the Company reviews its securities portfolio for impairment and determines if impairment is related to credit loss or non-credit loss. In making the assessment of whether a loss is from credit or other factors, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance is created, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.\nSubsequent activity related to the credit loss component (e.g. write-offs, recoveries) is recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses on debt securities available for sale. Securities held to maturity are evaluated under the allowance for credit losses model. For securities which have an expectation of zero nonpayment of the amortized cost basis (e.g. U.S. Treasury securities or agency securities), the expected credit loss is zero. Refer to Note 3  for further detail and information on securities.\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE\nRegions’ loans held for sale primarily includes commercial loans, investor real estate loans, and residential real estate mortgage loans. Loans held for sale are recorded at either estimated fair value, if the fair value option is elected, or the lower of cost or estimated fair value. \nRegions has elected to account for residential real estate mortgages originated with the intent to sell at fair value. Intent is established for these conforming residential real estate mortgage loans when Regions enters into an interest rate lock commitment. Gains and losses on these residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value option has been elected are included in mortgage income. Management has elected the fair value option for certain commercial loans originated with the intent to sell and gains and losses on those loans are included in capital markets income. \nRegions also transfers loans that were originally recorded as held for investment to held for sale when management has the intent to sell in the near term. These loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The amount is then considered the new cost basis of the loan. At the time of transfer, write-downs on the loans that are credit related are recorded as charge-offs. All other write-downs and gains and losses on the sale of these loans are included in other non-interest \n97\nTable of Contents\n \nexpense or other non-interest income (dependent on the type of loan). See the “Fair Value Measurements” section below for discussion of determining estimated fair value.\nLOANS\nRegions' loans balance is comprised of commercial, investor real estate and consumer loans. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are considered loans held for investment (or portfolio loans). Loans held for investment are carried at amortized cost (the principal amount outstanding, net of premiums, discounts, unearned income and deferred loan fees and costs). Regions elected to exclude accrued interest receivable balances from the amortized cost basis.  Interest receivable is included as a separate line item on the balance sheet. Interest income on all types of loans is accrued based on the contractual interest rate and the principal amount outstanding using methods that approximate the interest method, except for those loans classified as non-accrual. Premiums and discounts on purchased loans and non-refundable loan origination and commitment fees, net of direct costs of originating or acquiring loans, are deferred and recognized over the contractual or estimated lives of the related loans as an adjustment to the loans’ constant effective yield, which is included in interest income on loans. Direct financing, sales-type and leveraged leases are included within the commercial portfolio segment.  See Note 4  for further detail and information on loans and Note 13 for further detail and information on leases. \nRegions determines past due or delinquency status of a loan based on contractual payment terms.  \nCommercial and investor real estate loans are placed on non-accrual if any of the following conditions occur: 1) collection in full of contractual principal and interest is no longer reasonably assured (even if current as to payment status), 2) a partial charge-off has occurred, unless the loan has been brought current under its contractual terms (original or restructured terms) and the full originally contracted principal and interest is considered to be fully collectible, or 3) the loan is delinquent on any principal or interest for 90 days or more unless the obligation is secured by collateral having a net realizable value (estimated fair value less costs to sell) sufficient to fully discharge the obligation and the loan is in the legal process of collection. Factors considered regarding full collection include assessment of changes in borrower’s cash flow, valuation of underlying collateral, ability and willingness of guarantors to provide credit support, and other conditions. Charge-offs on commercial and investor real estate loans are primarily based on the facts and circumstances of the individual loan and occur when available information confirms the loan is not or will not be fully collectible. Factors considered in making these determinations are the borrower’s and any guarantor’s ability and willingness to pay, the status of the account in bankruptcy court (if applicable), and collateral value. Commercial and investor real estate loan relationships of $\n250,000\n or less are subject to charge-off or charge down to estimated fair value at \n180\n days past due, based on collateral value. Certain equipment finance loans are subject to charge-off at \n120\n days past due.\nNon-accrual and charge-off decisions for consumer loans are dictated by the FFIEC's Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy which establishes standards for the classification and treatment of consumer loans. The charge-off process drives consumer non-accrual status. If a consumer loan secured by real estate in a first lien position (residential first mortgage or home equity) becomes \n180\n days past due, Regions evaluates the loan for non-accrual status and potential charge-off based on collateral value. For home equity loans and lines of credit in a second lien position, the non-accrual evaluation is performed at \n120\n days past due and the potential charge-off evaluation is performed at 180 days past due. If a loan is secured by collateral having a net realizable value sufficient to fully discharge the obligation, then a partial write-down is not necessary and the loan remains on accrual status, provided it is in the process of legal collection. If a partial charge-off is necessary as a result of the evaluation, then the remaining balance is placed on non-accrual. Consumer loans not secured by real estate are generally charged-off at either \n120\n days past due for closed-end loans, \n180\n days past due for open-end loans other than credit cards or the end of the month in which the loan becomes \n180\n days past due for credit cards.\nWhen loans are placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest, amortization of loan premium, accretion of loan discount and amortization/accretion of deferred net loan fees/costs are discontinued. When a commercial or investor real estate loan is placed on non-accrual status, uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed and charged to interest income. Uncollected interest accrued from prior years on commercial and investor real estate loans placed on non-accrual status in the current year is charged against the allowance for loan losses. When a consumer loan is placed on non-accrual status, all uncollected interest accrued is reversed and charged to interest income due to immateriality. Interest collections on commercial and investor real estate non-accrual loans are applied as principal reductions. Interest collections on consumer non-accrual loans are recorded using the cash basis, due to immateriality.\nAll loans on non-accrual status may be returned to accrual status and interest accrual resumed if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the loan is brought contractually current as to both principal and interest, 2) future payments are reasonably expected to continue being received in accordance with the terms of the loan and repayment ability can be reasonably demonstrated, and 3) the loan has been performing for at least six months.\nPurchased Loans\nPurchased loans are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.  Purchased loans are evaluated and classified as either PCD, which indicates that the loan has experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination, or non-\n98\nTable of Contents\n \nPCD loans.  For PCD loans, the sum of the loans' purchase price and allowance for credit losses, which is determined using the same methodology as originated loans, becomes their initial amortized cost basis.  For non-PCD loans, the difference between the fair value and the par value is considered the fair value mark.  The non-credit discount or premium related to PCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD loans is accreted or amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. Subsequent changes in the allowance to the PCD and non-PCD loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses.\nModifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that eliminated the recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, also referred to as modifications to troubled borrowers. Modifications to troubled borrowers are considered in the allowance the same as all other portfolio loans as described in the allowance section below. The guidance also requires disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination. Regions applied the guidance prospectively, except Regions used the modified-retrospective transition method related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs. The cumulative effect of the modified-retrospective application was a decrease in the allowance of $38 million and an increase to retained earnings of $28 million, net of taxes.\nModifications to troubled borrowers are loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the time of modification and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of repayment. Modification types classified as modifications to troubled borrowers include interest rate reductions, other than insignificant term extensions, other than insignificant payment deferrals, principal forgiveness, or any combination of these. Further details are as follows:\n•\nInterest rate reductions are instances where the absolute interest rate is decreased as part of the modification. In instances where the rate index changes for variable-rate loans, Regions evaluates whether or not the absolute interest rate decreases from the original rate to the updated rate. \n•\nTerm extensions are maturity extensions, many of which occur through renewals or restructurings. \n•\nPayment deferrals include modifications wherein the contractual payment term is extended. Examples of payment deferral modifications include, but are not limited to, re-agings, payment delays or holidays, lengthening of amortization terms, allowing for an interest-only payment period, and capitalizing interest payments in loan restructurings. \n•\nRegions rarely grants principal forgiveness modifications.\nModifications to troubled borrowers are subject to policies governing accrual/non-accrual evaluation consistent with all other loans of the same product types. As such, modifications to troubled borrowers may include loans remaining on non-accrual, moving to non-accrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances.\n \nALLOWANCE\nThe allowance is intended to cover expected credit losses over the contractual life of loans measured at amortized cost, including unfunded commitments. Management’s measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and R&S forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. For periods beyond which Regions makes or obtains such R&S forecasts, Regions reverts to historical credit loss information. Regions maintains an appropriate level of allowance that falls within an acceptable range of estimated losses, measured in accordance with GAAP. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on many factors, including, but not limited to, an evaluation and rating of the loan portfolio; historical loan loss experience; current economic conditions; collateral values securing loans; levels of problem loans; volume, growth, quality and composition of the loan portfolio; regulatory guidance; R&S economic forecasts; and other relevant factors. Changes in any of these factors, assumptions, or the availability of new information, could require that the allowance be adjusted in future periods, perhaps materially. Loss forecasting models are built on historical loss information and then applied to the current portfolio.  Outputs from the loss forecasting models in combination with Regions' qualitative framework, and other analyses are used to inform management in its estimation of Regions' expected credit losses. Actual losses could vary, perhaps materially, from management’s estimates. The entire allowance is available to cover all charge-offs that arise from the loan portfolio.\nRegions does not estimate an allowance on interest receivable balances because the Company has non-accrual polices in place that provide for the accrual of interest to cease on a timely basis when all contractual amounts due are not expected.\nRegions' allowance calculation is a significant estimate. Regions uses its best judgment to assess economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes in underlying external or internal data. Therefore, assumptions and decisions driving the estimate may change as conditions change. These assumptions and estimates are detailed below.\nR & S forecast period\nDuring the two-year R&S forecast period, Regions incorporates forward-looking information by utilizing its internally developed and approved Base economic forecast. The scenario is developed by the Chief Economist and approved through a formal governance process. The Base forecast considers market forward/consensus information and is consistent with the \n99\nTable of Contents\n \nCompany's organization-wide economic outlook. When appropriate, additional scenarios, including externally created scenarios, are considered as part of the determination of the allowance. \nReversion period\nRegions utilizes an exponential reversion approach that reverts to TTC rates derived from the simple average of all historical quarterly observations for PD, LGD, EAD and prepayment rates. The length of the reversion period differs by class of financing receivable. \nHistorical loss period\nRegions does not adjust historical loss information for existing economic conditions or expectations of future economic conditions for periods that are beyond the R&S period. Regions utilizes internal historical loss information; however, there are certain loan portfolios that also benefit from the use of external or other reference data due to identified limitations with internal historical data.\nContractual life\nRegions estimates expected credit losses over the contractual life of a loan. Regions defines contractual life for non-revolving loans as contractual maturity, net of estimated prepayments and excluding expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless an extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by Regions.  \nContractual life of credit card receivables\nRegions estimates the life of credit card receivables based on the amount and timing of payments expected to be collected.  Regions' credit card allowance estimate only considers the amount of debt outstanding at the reporting date (the current position) because undrawn balances are unconditionally cancellable. Regions classifies credit card accounts into one of three payment patterns: dormant, transacting or revolving. The dormant accounts are idle, carry no balance, and do not contribute to the allowance. The transacting account holders tend to pay the entire balance due every month and are, therefore, subject to practically no interest charges. For transactor accounts, the current position balance is expected to be paid off in one quarter. The revolving accounts tend to be subject to interest charges, and their current position balance liquidates over time. The majority of Regions' credit card portfolio balances are categorized as revolvers for the purpose of the allowance. \nCollateral-dependent loans\nA loan is considered to be collateral-dependent if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and management expects substantial repayment of the loan through the sale or operation of the collateral. Regions' collateral-dependent consumer loans are loans secured by collateral (primarily real estate) that meet the partial charge-down requirements disclosed within this section. \nRegions defines significant commercial and investor real estate non-accrual loans wherein repayment is expected to be substantially from the sale or operation of collateral as collateral dependent. \nFor any collateral-dependent loans that meet Regions' specific allowance criteria (see below), Regions will calculate the allowance based on the fair value of collateral, less estimated cost to sell (if applicable). For collateral-dependent consumer, commercial and investor real estate loans that do not meet Regions' specific allowance criteria (as described below), Regions considers the value of the collateral through the LGD component of the loss model based on collateral type.  \nCredit enhancements\nRegions' estimate of credit losses reflects how credit enhancements, other than those that are freestanding contracts, mitigate expected credit losses on financial assets. In the event that a credit enhancement arrangement is considered to be a freestanding contract, Regions excludes the credit enhancement from the related loan when estimating expected credit losses. \nUnfunded commitments and other off-balance sheet items\nRegions records a liability or allowance for credit losses for the unfunded portion of a loan commitment in the event that Regions does not have the unconditional right to cancel the commitment. For an unfunded commitment to be considered unconditionally cancellable, Regions must be able to, at any time, with or without cause, refuse to extend credit.  The liability is measured over the full contractual period for which Regions is exposed to credit risk through a current obligation to extend credit. In determining the liability, management considers the likelihood that funding will occur, and if funded, the related expected credit losses under the allowance model.  \nRegions' off-balance sheet unfunded commitments in the form of home equity lines, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit and commercial revolving products that are deemed to be conditionally cancellable will include unfunded balances within the allowance estimate. Future advances from certain unfunded commitments and other revolving products where Regions does have the unconditional right to cancel these agreements will not be included.\n100\nTable of Contents\n \nCALCULATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nPooled allowances\nThe allowance is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist.  Segmentation variables for commercial and investor real estate segments include product, loan size, collateral type, risk rating and term. Segmentation variables considered for consumer segments include product, FICO, LTV, age, etc. The allowance is estimated for most portfolios and classes using econometric models to estimate expected credit losses. In general, discounted cash flow models are not used for the purpose of estimating expected losses for the purpose of the ACL. Most of the econometric models include PD, LGD, and EAD components. Less complex estimation methods are used for smaller loan portfolios.  \nSpecific reserves\nDue to their size, complexity and individualized risk characteristics and monitoring, the allowance for significant non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans and unfunded commitments is measured on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluation. Regions generally measures the allowance for these loans based on the present value of estimated cash flows, considering all facts and circumstances specific to the borrower and market and economic conditions. The allowance measurement for collateral-dependent loans that meet the individually evaluated threshold is based on the fair value of collateral less cost to sell, if applicable.\nQualitative framework\nWhile quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. Imprecision exists in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag between obtaining information, performing the calculation, as well as variations between estimates and actual outcomes.  Regions adjusts the allowance considering quantitative and qualitative factors which may not be directly measured in the modeled calculations. Regions' qualitative framework provides for specific quantitatively supported model adjustments and general imprecision adjustments. Specific model adjustments capture highly specific issues or events that Regions believes are not adequately captured in model outcomes. General imprecision adjustments address other sources of imprecision that are not specifically identifiable or quantifiable to a particular loan portfolio and have not been captured by the model or by a specific model adjustment. Regions considers general imprecision in three dimensions; economic forecast imprecision, model imprecision, and process imprecision. \nRefer to Note 5  for further discussion regarding the calculation of the allowance for credit losses.\n \nLEASES\nLESSEES\nRegions' lease portfolio is primarily composed of property leases that are classified as operating leases. Property leases, which primarily include office locations and retail branches, typically have original lease terms ranging from \n1\n year to \n20\n years, some of which may also include an option to extend the lease beyond the original lease term. In some circumstances, Regions may also have an option to terminate the lease early with advance notice. Regions includes renewal and termination options within the lease term if deemed reasonably certain of exercise. As most leases do not state an implicit rate, Regions utilizes the incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Regions continues to recognize lease payments as an expense over the lease term as appropriate. \nOperating leases vary in term and, from time to time, include incentives and/or rent escalations. Examples of incentives include periods of “free” rent and leasehold improvement incentives. Regions recognizes incentives and escalations on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a reduction of or increase to rent expense, as applicable, within net occupancy expense in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 13 for additional information.\n \nLESSORS\nRegions engages in both direct financing and sales-type leasing. Regions also has a portfolio of leveraged leases. These arrangements provide equipment financing for leased assets, such as vehicles and aircraft. At the commencement date, Regions (lessor) enters into an agreement with the customer (lessee) to lease the underlying equipment for a specified lease term. The lease agreements may provide customers the option to terminate the lease by buying the equipment at fair market value at the time of termination or at the end of the lease term. Regions' equipment finance asset management group performs due diligence procedures on the lease residual and overall equipment values as part of the origination process. Regions performs lease residual value reviews on an ongoing basis. In order to manage the residual value risk inherent in some of its direct financing leases, Regions purchases residual value insurance from an independent third party.\n101\nTable of Contents\n \nSales-type, direct financing, and leveraged leases are recorded within loans on the consolidated balance sheet. The net investment in direct financing leases is the sum of all minimum lease payments and estimated residual values, less unearned income. Lease contracts are structured with either fixed or variable lease payment terms. Variable lease payments are based on an index provided within the leasing agreement. Unearned income is recognized over the terms of the leases to produce a constant effective yield. The net investment in leveraged leases is the sum of all lease payments (less non-recourse debt payments) and estimated residual values, less unearned income. Income from leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the leases based on the unrecovered equity investment. See Note 13 for additional information.\n \nOTHER EARNING ASSETS\nOther earning assets consist of investments in Federal Reserve Bank stock, FHLB stock, marketable equity securities and other miscellaneous earning assets. Ownership of Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock is a requirement for all banks seeking membership into and access to the services provided by these banking systems. These shares are accounted for at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net income. See Note 7  for additional information.\n \nPREMISES, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, as applicable. Land is carried at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the improvements (or the terms of the leases, if shorter). Generally, premises and leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over \n7\n-\n40\n years. Furniture and equipment are generally depreciated or amortized over \n3\n-\n10\n years. Software is generally depreciated over 3 years (or over a longer estimated life of \n5\n-\n20\n years for larger software systems). Premises, equipment, and software are evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Maintenance and repairs are charged to non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Improvements that either add functionality or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized to the carrying value and depreciated. See Note 8  for detail of premises and equipment.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets include goodwill, which is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses, and other identifiable intangible assets. Other identifiable intangible assets primarily include relationship assets, which are amortized over their expected useful lives, and agency commercial real estate licenses, which are non-amortizing.\nThe Company’s goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. Regions assesses the following indicators of goodwill impairment for each reporting period:\n•\nRecent operating performance,\n•\nChanges in market capitalization,\n•\nRegulatory actions and assessments,\n•\nChanges in the business climate (including legislation, legal factors and competition),\n•\nCompany-specific factors (including changes in key personnel, asset impairments, and business dispositions), and\n•\nTrends in the banking industry.\nAdverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit, or other factors could result in a decline in the implied estimated fair value of goodwill. Accounting guidance permits the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If, based on the weight of the evidence, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds book value, then an impairment test is not necessary. If the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, or concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a goodwill impairment test is performed. The Company compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in non-interest expense in an amount equal to that excess.\nFor purposes of performing the qualitative assessment, Regions' evaluation may include, but is not limited to, events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, regulatory actions and assessments, changes in the business climate, company-specific factors, and trends in the banking industry to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount.\nFor purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test, if applicable, Regions uses both income and market approaches to value its reporting units. The income approach, which is the primary valuation approach, consists of discounting projected \n102\nTable of Contents\n \nlong-term future cash flows, which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for the respective reporting units. The significant inputs to the income approach include expected future cash flows, the long-term target equity ratios, and the discount rate. The market approaches incorporate comparable public company information, valuation multiples, and consideration of a market control premium along with data related to comparable observed purchase transactions in the financial services industry for the reporting units.\nOther identifiable intangible assets are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or circumstances that could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset. These events could include loss of relationships, increased competition, or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent other identifiable intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, impairment losses are recorded in non-interest expense and reduce the carrying amount of the asset.\nRefer to Note 9  for further detail and discussion of the results of the goodwill and other identifiable intangibles impairment tests.\nACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\nRegions accounts for transfers of financial assets as sales when control over the transferred assets is surrendered. Control is generally considered to have been surrendered when 1) the transferred assets are legally isolated from the Company or its consolidated affiliates, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, 2) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets with no conditions that constrain the transferee and provide more than a trivial benefit to the Company, and 3) the Company does not maintain the obligation or unilateral ability to reclaim or repurchase the assets. If these sale criteria are met, the transferred assets are removed from the Company’s balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized. If not met, the transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing, and the assets remain on the Company’s balance sheet, the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability, and gain or loss on sale is deferred until the sale criterion are achieved.\nResidential Mortgage Banking Activities\nRegions has elected to account for its residential MSRs using the fair value measurement method. Under the fair value measurement method, residential MSRs are measured at estimated fair value each period with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage income. The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates, servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of residential mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying amount of residential MSRs. The valuation method relies on an OAS to consider prepayment risk and equate the asset's discounted cash flows to its market price. See the “Fair Value Measurements” section below for additional discussion regarding determination of fair value.\nCommercial Mortgage Banking Activities\nCommercial mortgage banking through the DUS lending program\nRegions is a DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-family housing market. Regions' DUS related commercial MSRs are recorded in other assets at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and are amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections of the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows, which is recorded as a component of capital markets income. The amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. Regions periodically evaluates these commercial MSRs for impairment. Regions has a one-third loss share guarantee associated with the majority of the DUS servicing portfolio. The other two-thirds loss share guarantee is retained by Fannie Mae. The estimated fair value of the loss share guarantee is recorded in other liabilities.\nCommercial mortgage banking through non-DUS agency programs\nRegions participates in additional multi-family housing market liquidity activities outside of the DUS lending program through other agency programs. Regions' related commercial MSRs outside of the DUS program are recorded in other assets and accounted for using the fair value measurement method. Under the fair value measurement method, these commercial MSRs are measured at estimated fair value each period with changes in fair value recorded as a component of capital markets income. The fair value of commercial MSRs is calculated using various assumptions including future cash flows, market discount rates, credit spreads, and other factors. See the “Fair Value Measurements” section below for additional discussion regarding determination of fair value.\nRefer to Note 6  for further information on servicing of financial assets.\nFORECLOSED PROPERTY AND OTHER REAL ESTATE\nOther real estate and certain other assets acquired in satisfaction of indebtedness (“foreclosure”) are carried in other assets at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell the property. At the date of transfer from the loan portfolio, if the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the property’s estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell, a write-down is recorded against the allowance. Regions allows a period of up to 60 days after the date of transfer to record finalized write-downs as charge-offs against the allowance in order to properly accumulate all related invoices and \n103\nTable of Contents\n \nupdated valuation information, if necessary. Subsequent to transfer, Regions obtains valuations from professional valuation experts and/or third party appraisers on at least an annual basis. See the “Fair Value Measurements” section below for additional discussion regarding determination of fair value. Subsequent to transfer and the additional 60 days, any further write-downs are recorded as other non-interest expense. Gain or loss on the sale of foreclosed property and other real estate is included in other non-interest expense. \nFrom time to time, assets classified as premises and equipment are transferred to held for sale for various reasons. These assets are carried in other assets at the lower of the recorded investment in the asset or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell based upon the property’s appraised value at the date of transfer. Any adjustments to property held for sale are recorded as other non-interest expense.\n \nOTHER INVESTMENT ASSETS\nRegions has investments of approximately $\n263\n million and $\n262\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that are recognized in other assets and accounted for using either the equity method of accounting or the measurement alternative to fair value for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value. \nEquity method investments consist primarily of investments in SBICs and private equity funds. Under the equity method of accounting, Regions records its proportionate share of the profits or losses of the investment entity as an adjustment to the carrying value of the investment and as a component of other non-interest income. Dividends and distributions received or receivables from these investments are recorded as reductions to the carrying value of the investments. The net balances of equity method investments were approximately $\n198\n million and $\n192\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nEquity investments that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for under the equity method and do not have a readily determinable fair value are accounted for at cost under the measurement alternative to fair value with adjustments for impairment and observable price changes as applicable. Dividends received or receivable and observable price changes from these investments are included as components of other non-interest income. These investments consist primarily of investments in strategic partners and certain CRA projects. The carrying amounts of these investments was $\n65\n million and $\n70\n million December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, facilitate asset/liability management strategies and manage other exposures. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, options including interest rate caps, floors and collars, forward rate contracts and forward sale commitments. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as other assets or other liabilities, as applicable, at estimated fair value. Regions enters into master netting agreements with counterparties and/or requires collateral to cover exposures. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Company, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. For purposes of the consolidated balance sheets, the Company offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement. In at least some cases, counterparties post collateral at a zero threshold regardless of credit rating. The majority of interest rate derivatives traded by Regions with dealing counterparties are subject to mandatory clearing through a central clearinghouse. The variation margin payments made for derivatives cleared through a central clearinghouse are legally characterized as settlements of the derivatives. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse.\nInterest rate swaps are agreements to exchange interest payments based upon notional amounts. Interest rate swaps subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates, changes in interest rate volatility, as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. Option contracts involve rights to buy or sell financial instruments on a specified date or over a period at a specified price. These rights do not have to be exercised. Some option contracts such as interest rate floors, involve the exchange of cash based on changes in specified indices. Interest rate floors are contracts to hedge interest rate declines based on a notional amount, generally associated with a principal balance at risk. Interest rate floors subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates, changes in interest rate volatility, as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. Regions primarily enters into forward rate contracts on marketable instruments, which expose Regions to market risk associated with changes in the value of the underlying financial instrument, as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. Forward sale commitments are sales of securities at a specified price at a future date. Forward sale commitments subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in market value, as well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform.\nThe Company elects to account for certain derivative financial instruments as accounting hedges which, based on the exposure being hedged, are either fair value or cash flow hedges.\n104\nTable of Contents\n \nFair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of the hedged risk in an asset, liability or firm commitment. Certain fair value hedges may be entered into using the portfolio layer method, which allows the Company to hedge the interest rate risk of prepayable financial assets by designating as the hedged item a stated amount of a closed portfolio that is expected to be outstanding for the designated hedge period(s). Under the fair value hedging model, gains or losses attributable to the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the gains and losses attributable to the change in fair value of the hedged item, are recognized in interest income or interest expense in the same income statement line item with the hedged item in the period in which the change in fair value occurs. To the extent the changes in fair value of the derivative do not offset the changes in fair value of the hedged item, the difference is recognized. The corresponding adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the hedged item, while the corresponding change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded as an adjustment to other assets or other liabilities, as applicable. \nCash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. For cash flow hedge relationships, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) except for amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item where the earnings effect of the hedged item is presented in the period or periods during which the hedged item impacts earnings.\nThe Company formally documents all hedging relationships, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions. The Company performs periodic qualitative and quantitative assessments to determine whether the hedging relationship has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items and whether the relationship is expected to continue to be highly effective in the future.\n If a hedge relationship is de-designated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedged item no longer exists, or does not meet the definition of a firm commitment, or because it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the derivative will continue to be recorded as an other asset or other liability in the consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other non-interest expense. Any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm commitment is removed from the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses that were unrecognized and aggregated in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) pursuant to the hedge of a forecasted transaction are recognized immediately in other non-interest expense.\nDerivative contracts for which the Company has not elected to apply hedge accounting are classified as other assets or liabilities with gains and losses related to the change in fair value recognized in capital markets income or mortgage income, as applicable, in the statements of income during the period. These positions, as well as non-derivative instruments, are used to mitigate economic and accounting volatility related to customer derivative transactions, the mortgage pipeline and the fair value of residential MSRs.\nRegions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. Accordingly, such commitments are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income or capital markets income, as applicable. Regions also has corresponding forward sale commitments related to these interest rate lock commitments, which are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income or capital markets income, as applicable. See the “Fair Value Measurements” section below for additional information related to the valuation of interest rate lock commitments.\nRegions enters into various derivative agreements with customers desiring protection from possible future market fluctuations. Regions manages the market risk associated with these derivative agreements. The contracts in this portfolio for which the Company has elected not to apply hedge accounting are marked-to-market through capital markets income and included in other assets and other liabilities.\nConcurrent with the election to use fair value measurement for residential MSRs, Regions began using various derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs in the statements of income. This effort may involve the use of various derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and TBA's designed as derivative instruments. These derivatives are carried at estimated fair value, with changes in fair value reported in mortgage income.\nDerivative assets and liabilities are included in other assets and liabilities as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \nRefer to Note 20 for further discussion and details of derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Accrued income taxes and the net balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported in other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, as appropriate. The Company reflects the expected amount of income tax to be paid or refunded during the year as current income \n105\nTable of Contents\n \ntax expense or benefit, as applicable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that the Company expects will apply at the time when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for any tax attributes, such as tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. The Company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available, and a valuation allowance is recorded for any deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized.  Any effect of a change in federal and state tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense, in the period that includes the enactment date. \nThe Company will evaluate and recognize income tax benefits related to any uncertain tax positions using the recognition and cumulative-probability measurement thresholds. If the Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained, the Company records a liability for the uncertain tax position. If a tax benefit is more-likely-than-not of being sustained based on the technical merits, the Company utilizes the cumulative probability measurement and records an income tax benefit equivalent to the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within current income tax expense.\nThe Company applies the proportional amortization method in accounting for its investments in qualified affordable housing and economic development projects. This method recognizes the amortized cost of the investment as a component of income tax expense.\nThe deferral method of accounting is used for investments that generate investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction of the related asset.\nRefer to Note 19 for further discussion regarding income taxes.\nTREASURY STOCK AND SHARE REPURCHASES\nThe purchase of the Company’s common stock is recorded at cost. At the date of repurchase, shareholders' equity is reduced by the repurchase price, which, beginning in 2023, includes any required excise tax payments on share repurchases. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides for a stock buyback excise tax equal to one percent of the fair market value of stock repurchased during the period less the fair market value of any stock issued during the period, including compensatory stock issuances. Treasury stock would be reduced by the cost of such stock with the excess of repurchase price over par or stated value recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the Company subsequently reissues treasury shares, treasury stock is reduced by the cost of such stock with differences recorded in additional paid-in capital or retained earnings, as applicable.\nPursuant to past practice, shares repurchased were immediately retired, and therefore were not included in treasury stock. The Company's policy related to these share repurchases is to reduce its common stock based on the par value of the shares repurchased and to reduce its additional paid-in capital for the excess of the repurchase price over the par value.\nSHARE-BASED PAYMENTS \nRegions sponsors stock plans which most commonly include restricted stock (i.e., unvested common stock) units, restricted stock awards and performance stock units. The Company accounts for share-based payments under the fair value recognition provisions whereby compensation cost is measured based on the estimated fair value of the award at the grant date and is recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for service-based awards. The fair value of restricted stock units, restricted stock awards or performance stock units is determined based on the closing price of Regions common stock on the date of grant. Historical data is also used to estimate future employee attrition, which is considered in calculating estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are adjusted when actual forfeitures differ from estimates, resulting in the recognition of compensation cost only for awards that vest. The effect of a change in estimated forfeitures is recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment that is included in salaries and employee benefits expense in the period of the change in estimate. As compensation cost is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions.  At the time the share-based awards are exercised, cancelled, have expired, or restrictions are released, the Company may be required to recognize an adjustment to tax expense depending on the market price of the Company’s common stock. \nSee Note 16 for further discussion and details of share-based payments.\n106\nTable of Contents\n \nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nRegions uses an expected long-term rate of return applied to the fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year and the expected cash flows during the year for calculating the expected investment return on all pension plan assets.  At a minimum, amortization of the net gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions is included as a component of net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets. If amortization is required, the minimum amortization is that excess divided by the average remaining service period of participants in the plan for active associates and the estimated average remaining life expectancy of participants in the plan for inactive associates. Regions records the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost in salaries and employee benefits expense. The other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost are recorded in other non-interest expense. Regions uses a third-party actuary to compute the remaining service period of active participating employees. This period reflects expected turnover, pre-retirement mortality, and other applicable employee demographics.\nSee Note 17 for further discussion and details of employee benefit plans.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company records revenue when control of the promised products or services is transferred to the customer (or performance obligations have been met), in an amount that reflects the consideration Regions expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services. Related to contract costs, Regions expenses sales commissions and any related contract costs when incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. Related to remaining performance obligations, Regions does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for 1) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and 2) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which Regions has the right to invoice for services performed.\nInterest Income\nThe largest source of revenue for Regions is interest income. Interest income is recognized using the interest method driven by nondiscretionary formulas based on written contracts, such as loan agreements or securities contracts. \nService Charges on Deposit Accounts\nService charges on deposit accounts include overdraft fees and other service charges. When a depositor presents an item for payment in excess of available funds, overdraft fees are earned when Regions, at its discretion, provides the necessary funds to complete the transaction. Prior to mid-2022, service charges on deposit accounts also included non-sufficient fund fees, which were earned when a depositor presented an item for payment in excess of available funds and an item was returned unpaid. \nRegions generates other service charges by providing depositors proper safeguard and remittance of funds as well as by providing optional services for depositors, such as check imaging or treasury management, that are performed upon the depositor’s request. Charges for the proper safeguard and remittance of funds are recognized monthly, as the customer retains funds in the account. Regions recognizes revenue for other optional services when the customer uses the selected service to execute a transaction (e.g., execute an ACH wire).\nCard and ATM Fees\nCard and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card, debit card, and ATM related revenue. The majority of the fees are card interchange where Regions earns a fee for remitting cardholder funds (or extends credit) via a third party network to merchants. Regions satisfies performance obligations for each transaction when the card is used and the funds are remitted. The network establishes interchange fees that the merchant remits to Regions for each transaction, and Regions incurs costs from the network for facilitating the interchange with the merchant. Due to its inability to establish prices and direct activities of the related processing network’s service, Regions is deemed the agent in this arrangement and records interchange revenues net of related costs. Regions also pays consideration to certain commercial card holders based on interchange fees and contractual volume. These costs are recognized as a reduction to interchange income. Additionally, Regions offers rewards to its customers based on card usage. The costs associated with these programs are recorded when services are provided as a reduction of card fees.\nCard and ATM fees also include ATM fee income generated from allowing a Regions cardholder to withdraw funds from a non-Regions ATM and from allowing a non-Regions cardholder to withdraw funds from a Regions ATM. Regions satisfies performance obligations for each transaction when the withdrawal is processed. Regions does not direct activities of the related processing network’s service and recognizes revenue on a net basis as the agent in each transaction.\nInvestment Management and Trust Fee Income\nInvestment management and trust fee income represents revenue generated from asset management services provided to individuals, businesses, and institutions. Regions has a fiduciary responsibility to the beneficiary of the trust to perform agreed \n107\nTable of Contents\n \nupon services which can include investing the assets, periodic reporting to the beneficiaries, and providing tax information regarding the trust. In exchange for these trust and custodial services, Regions collects fee income from beneficiaries as contractually determined via fee schedules. Regions’ performance obligations to customers are primarily satisfied over time as the services are performed and provided to the customer.\nMortgage Income\nMortgage income is recognized when earned or as each transaction occurs through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. Mortgage income also includes any fair value adjustments for residential mortgage loans Regions has elected to measure under the fair value option and fair value adjustments related to residential mortgage servicing rights.  \nCapital Markets Income\nRegions generates capital markets fee revenue through capital raising activities which include revenue streams such as securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services, and commercial mortgage banking activities. For those revenue streams, revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time which coincides with the satisfaction of a single performance obligation, typically the transaction closing. Capital markets income also includes any fair value adjustments for commercial mortgage loans Regions has elected to measure under the fair value option and fair value adjustments related to mortgage servicing rights.\nSecurities underwriting and placement fees involve the issuing and distribution of securities for an underwriting fee from customers. The underwriting fee is a single performance obligation which is satisfied at the time that the transaction is closed, and the amount of the fee is either a fixed or variable percentage based on the deal value which is determinable at the time of deal closing.\nRegions generates revenue from affordable housing investments through the syndication of investment funds to third parties. Regions transfers the primary benefits of the investment to the customer and recognizes syndication revenue on the closing date of the transaction.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nBank-owned life insurance income primarily represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. Regions recognizes revenue each period in the amount of the appreciation of the cash surrender value of the insurance policies. Revenue from the proceeds of insurance benefits is recognized at the time a claim is confirmed.\nCommercial Credit Fee Income\nCommercial credit fee income includes letters of credit fees and unused commercial commitment fees. Regions recognizes revenue for letters of credit fees and unused commercial commitment fees over time. \nInvestment Services Fee Income\nInvestment services fee income represents income earned from investment advisory services. Through the use of third party carriers, Regions provides its customers with access to investment products that meet customers’ financial needs and investment objectives. Upon selection of an investment product, the customer enters into a policy with the carrier. Regions’ performance obligation is satisfied by fulfilling its responsibility to place customers in investment vehicles for which Regions earns commissions from the carrier based on agreed-upon fee percentages. In addition, Regions has a contractual relationship with a third party broker dealer to provide full service brokerage and investment advisory activities. As the principal in the arrangement, Regions recognizes the investment services commissions on a gross basis.\nSecurities Gains (Losses), Net\nNet securities gains or losses result from Regions’ asset/liability management process. Gains or losses on the sale of securities are recognized as each sales transaction occurs with the cost of securities sold based on the specific identification method.\nMarket Value Adjustments on Employee Benefit Assets \nRegions holds assets for certain employee benefit assets, both defined and other. Those assets are recorded at estimated fair value and the market value variations are recognized each period.\nOther Miscellaneous Income\nOther miscellaneous income includes miscellaneous revenue from affordable housing, income from SBIC investments, valuation adjustments to equity investments, commercial loan and leasing related income, fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees, and other miscellaneous income including unusual gains. Regions recognizes the related fee or gain in a manner that reflects the timing of when transactions occur or as services are provided.\n \n108\nTable of Contents\n \nPER SHARE AMOUNTS\nEarnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the effect of restricted and performance stock awards, if dilutive. Refer to Note 15 for additional information\n.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value guidance establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price). A fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. Required disclosures include stratification of balance sheet amounts measured at fair value based on inputs the Company uses to derive fair value measurements. These strata include:\n•\nLevel 1 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (which include exchanges and over-the-counter markets with sufficient volume),\n•\nLevel 2 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market, and\n•\nLevel 3 valuations, where the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on Company-specific data. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company’s own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability.\nITEMS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS\nDebt securities available for sale, certain mortgage loans held for sale, marketable equity securities, residential MSRs, commercial mortgage servicing through non-DUS agency programs,\n \nderivative assets and derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Below is a description of valuation methodologies for these assets and liabilities.\nDebt securities available for sale\n consist of U.S. Treasuries, MBS (including agency securities), obligations of states and political subdivisions, and other debt securities.\n•\nU.S. Treasuries are valued based on quoted market prices of identical assets on active exchanges. Pricing received for U.S. Treasuries from third-party services is based on a market approach using dealer quotes from multiple active market makers and real-time trading systems. These valuations are Level 1 measurements.\n•\nMBS are valued primarily using data from third-party pricing services for similar securities as applicable. Pricing from these third-party services is generally based on a market approach using observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, benchmark securities, TBA prices, issuer spreads, bids and offers, monthly payment information, and collateral performance, as applicable. These valuations are Level 2 measurements. Where such comparable data is not available, the Company develops valuations based on assumptions that are not readily observable in the market place; these valuations are Level 3 measurements.\n•\nObligations of states and political subdivisions are generally based on data from third-party pricing services. The valuations are based on a market approach using observable inputs such as benchmark yields, relevant trade data, material event notices and new issue data. These valuations are Level 2 measurements.\n•\nOther debt securities are valued based on Level 1, 2 and 3 measurements, depending on pricing methodology selected and are valued primarily using data from third-party pricing services. Pricing from these third-party services is generally based on a market approach using observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids and offers, and TRACE reported trades.\nThe majority of Regions' debt securities available for sale are valued using third-party pricing services. To validate pricing related to liquid investment securities, which represent the vast majority of the available for sale portfolio (e.g., MBS), Regions compares price changes received from the third-party pricing service to overall changes in market factors in order to validate the pricing received. To validate pricing received on less liquid investment securities in the available for sale portfolio, Regions receives pricing from third-party brokers-dealers on a sample of securities that are then compared to the pricing received. The pricing service uses standard observable inputs when available, for example: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, and bids and offers, among others. For certain security types, additional inputs may be used, or some inputs may not be applicable. It is not customary for Regions to adjust the pricing received for the available for sale portfolio. In the event that prices are adjusted, Regions classifies the measurement as a Level 3 measurement.\n109\nTable of Contents\n \nMortgage loans held for sale\n consist of residential first mortgage loans and commercial mortgages held for sale. Regions has elected to measure certain residential and commercial mortgage loans held for sale at fair value by applying the fair value option (see additional discussion under the “Fair Value Option” section in Note 21). The residential first mortgage loans held for sale are valued based on traded market prices of similar assets where available and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for securitization activities that include servicing value and market conditions, a Level 2 measurement. The commercial mortgage loans held for sale are valued based on traded market prices for comparable commercial mortgage-backed securitizations, into which the loans will be placed, adjusted for movements of interest rates and credit spreads, a Level 3 measurement due to the unobservable inputs included in the credit spreads for bonds in commercial mortgage-backed securitizations. \nMarketable equity securities, \nwhich\n \nprimarily consist of assets held for certain employee benefits and money market funds, are valued based on quoted market prices of identical assets on active exchanges; these valuations are Level 1 measurements. \nResidential mortgage servicing rights\n are valued using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, a Level 3 measurement. The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated at least quarterly by values received from independent third parties. See Note 6  for information regarding the servicing of financial assets and additional details regarding the assumptions relevant to this valuation.\nCommercial mortgage servicing through non-DUS agency programs\n are recorded at fair value and are valued using a discounted cash flow approach, a Level 3 measurement. The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated at least annually by values received from independent third parties. See Note 6  for information regarding the servicing of financial assets and additional details regarding the assumptions relevant to this valuation.\nDerivative assets and liabilities, \nwhich primarily consist of interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity contracts that include forwards, futures, options and swaps, are included in other assets and other liabilities (as applicable) on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest rate swaps are predominantly traded in over-the-counter markets and, as such, values are determined using widely accepted discounted cash flow models, which are Level 2 measurements. These discounted cash flow models use projections of future cash payments/receipts that are discounted at an appropriate index rate. Regions utilizes forward curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of interest rate and commodity derivatives. The projected future cash flows are sourced from an assumed yield curve, which is consistent with industry standards and conventions. These valuations are adjusted for the unsecured credit risk at the reporting date, which considers collateral posted and the impact of master netting agreements. For options and futures contracts traded in over-the-counter markets, values are determined using discounted cash flow analyses and option pricing models based on market rates and volatilities, which are Level 2 measurements. Interest rate lock commitments on loans intended for sale and risk participations categorized as credit derivatives are valued using option pricing models that incorporate significant unobservable inputs, and therefore are Level 3 measurements.\nSecurities sold, but not yet purchased\n are comprised of equity securities the Company has sold but does not yet own for the purpose of hedging institutional brokerage customer activities. The obligations for these transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis, carried at fair value, and reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These obligations are classified as Level 1 when quoted market prices are available in an active market for the identical securities.\nITEMS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS\nFrom time to time, certain assets may be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically are a result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or a write-down occurring during the period. For example, if the fair value of an asset in these categories falls below its cost basis, it is considered to be at fair value at the end of the period of the adjustment. In periods where there is no adjustment, the asset is generally not considered to be at fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\nForeclosed property and other real estate\n is carried in other assets at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value less estimated costs to sell the property. The fair value for foreclosed property that is based on either observable transactions of similar instruments or formally committed sale prices is classified as a Level 2 measurement. If no formally committed sale price is available, Regions also obtains valuations from professional valuation experts and/or third party appraisers. Updated valuations are obtained on at least an annual basis. Foreclosed property exceeding established dollar thresholds is valued based on appraisals. Appraisals are performed by third-parties with appropriate professional certifications and conform to generally accepted appraisal standards as evidenced by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. Regions’ policies related to appraisals conform to regulations established by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 and other regulatory guidance. Professional valuations are considered Level 2 measurements because they are based largely on observable inputs. Regions has a centralized appraisal review function that is responsible for reviewing appraisals for compliance with banking regulations and guidelines as well as appraisal standards. Based on these reviews, Regions may make adjustments to the market value conclusions determined in the appraisals of real estate (either as other real estate or loans held for sale) when the appraisal review function determines that the valuation is based \n110\nTable of Contents\n \non inappropriate assumptions or where the conclusion is not sufficiently supported by the market data presented in the appraisal. Adjustments to the market value conclusions are discussed with the professional valuation experts and/or third-party appraisers; the magnitude of the adjustments that are not mutually agreed upon is insignificant. Adjustments, if made, must be based on sufficient information available to support an alternate opinion of market value. An estimated standard discount factor, which is updated at least annually, is applied to the appraisal amount for certain commercial and investor real estate properties when the recorded investment in the loan is transferred into foreclosed property. Internally adjusted valuations are considered Level 3 measurements as management uses assumptions that may not be observable in the market. These non-recurring fair value measurements are typically recorded on the date an updated offered quote, appraisal, or third-party valuation is received.\nEquity investments without a readily determinable fair value \nare adjusted prospectively to estimated fair value when an observable price transaction for a same or similar investment with the same issuer occurs; these valuations are Level 3 measurements. \nLoans held for sale\n for which the fair value option has not been elected are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore may be reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The fair values for commercial loans held for sale are based on Company-specific data not observable in the market. These valuations are Level 3 measurements. \nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments that are not disclosed above:\nCash and cash equivalents\n: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows approximate the estimated fair values. Because these amounts generally relate to either currency or highly liquid assets, these are considered Level 1 valuations.\nDebt securities held to maturity\n: The fair values of debt securities held to maturity are estimated in the same manner as the corresponding debt securities available for sale, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nLoans (excluding sales-type, direct financing, and leveraged leases), net of unearned income and allowance for loan losses\n: A discounted cash flow method under the income approach is utilized to estimate the fair value of the loan portfolio. The discounted cash flow method relies upon assumptions about the amount and timing of scheduled principal and interest payments, principal prepayments, and current market  rates. The loan portfolio is aggregated into categories based on loan type and credit quality. For each loan category, weighted average statistics, such as coupon rate, age, and remaining term are calculated. These are Level 3 valuations.\nOther earning assets (excluding equity investments)\n: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the estimated fair values. When available, the fair values of these other earning assets are estimated using quoted market prices of identical instruments traded in active markets and are considered Level 1 measurements. Other instruments utilize valuation inputs that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources or are reported at par as required by regulatory guidelines, and are considered Level 2 valuations. \nDeposits\n: The fair value of non-interest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certain other time deposit accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., the carrying amount) and are considered Level 2 valuations. Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on market spreads to benchmark rates, and are considered Level 2 valuations.\nShort-term borrowings:\n The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the estimated fair values, and are considered Level 2 measurements as similar instruments are traded in active markets. \nLong-term borrowings\n: The fair values of certain long term borrowings are estimated using quoted market prices of identical instruments in non-active markets and are considered Level 2 valuations. Otherwise, valuations are based on non-binding broker quotes and are considered Level 3 valuations.\nLoan commitments and letters of credit\n: The fair value of these instruments is reasonably estimated by the carrying value of deferred fees plus the unfunded loan commitments reserve related to the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Because the valuation inputs are not observable in the market and are considered Company specific, these are Level 3 valuations.\nSee Note 21 for additional information related to fair value measurements\n.\n111\nTable of Contents\n \nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \nThe following table provides a brief description of accounting standards adopted in 2024 and those that could have a material impact to Regions’ consolidated financial statements upon adoption in the future.\nStandard\nDescription\nRequired Date of Adoption\nEffect on Regions' financial statements or other significant matters\nStandards Adopted (or partially adopted) in 2024\nASU 2023-02, Investments —Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323) Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures\nUsing the Proportional Amortization Method\nThis Update allows entities to elect to account for equity investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the tax credit program through which the investment earns income tax credits, if certain conditions were met. \nThe Update also sets forth the conditions needed to apply the proportional amortization method. \nThe Update further eliminates certain low income housing tax credit-specific guidance to align the accounting more closely for low income housing tax credits with the accounting for other equity investments in tax credit structures and require that the delayed equity contribution apply only to tax equity investments accounted for using the proportional amortization method.\nJanuary 1, 2024\nRegions adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2024 with\nno material impact. \nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nThe Update requires entities to provide disclosure of significant segment expenses, as defined within the standard, and requires that entities disclose other segment items by reportable segment.

Regions will continue to evaluate through date of adoption.\n112\nTable of Contents\n \nNOTE 2. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES \nRegions is involved in various entities that are considered to be VIEs, as defined by authoritative accounting literature. Generally, a VIE is a corporation, partnership, trust or other legal structure that either does not have equity investors with substantive voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. The following discusses the VIEs in which Regions has a significant interest.\nRegions periodically invests in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects and economic development projects, which then provide tax credits to Regions. These investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity. These partnerships meet the definition of a VIE and are collectively referred to as tax credit investments in the table below. On January 1, 2024, the Company adopted accounting guidance that allows the Company to utilize the proportional amortization method of accounting for economic development projects, which has historically been used for affordable housing projects. Economic development projects are not presented in prior periods as their balances were not material. Due to the nature of the management activities of the general partner, Regions is not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships. Refer to Note 1 for additional details. Additionally, Regions has loans or letters of credit commitments with certain limited partnerships. The funded portion of the loans and letters of credit are classified as commercial and industrial loans or investor real estate loans as applicable in Note 4 .\nA summary of Regions’ tax credit investments and related loans and letters of credit, representing Regions’ maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, is as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nTax credit investments included in other assets\n$\n1,471\n \n$\n1,415\n \nUnfunded tax credit commitments included in other liabilities\n590\n \n592\n \nLoans and letters of credit commitments\n663\n \n730\n \nFunded portion of loans and letters of credit commitments\n336\n \n395\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nTax credits and other tax benefits recognized\n$\n236\n \n$\n207\n \n$\n180\n \nTax credit amortization expense included in income tax expense\n188\n \n166\n \n149\n \nIn addition to the investments discussed above, Regions also syndicates affordable housing investments. In these syndication transactions, Regions creates affordable housing funds in which a subsidiary is the general partner or managing member and sells limited partnership interests to third parties. Regions' general partner or managing member interest represents an insignificant interest in the affordable housing fund. The affordable housing funds meet the definition of a VIE.

The increase in the total amount of unrealized losses was impacted by changes in market interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no individual unrealized loss represented credit impairment as of those dates. At December 31, 2024, the Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity.\nGross realized losses on sales of debt securities available for sale totaled $\n222\n million and gross realized gains totaled $\n14\n million for 2024. Therefore, the Company recognized net realized losses of $\n208\n million for 2024. Gross realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities available for sale were immaterial for 2023 and 2022. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. As part of the Company's normal process for evaluating impairment, including credit-related impairment, impairment identified by management was immaterial for 2024 and 2023. No credit-related impairment was identified by management for 2022.\n116\nTable of Contents\n \nNOTE 4.

Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing on land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness of underlying borrowers, particularly cash flow from customers’ business operations, and is impacted by sensitivity to several other factors, such as market fluctuations in commodity prices.\nInvestor Real Estate\n—Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions’ investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions’ markets. Additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Loans in this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the valuation of real estate.\nConsumer\n—The consumer portfolio segment includes residential first mortgage, home equity lines, home equity loans,  consumer credit card, other consumer—exit portfolios and other consumer loans. Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a  15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower’s residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market values as of the time the loan or line is secured directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses. Consumer credit card lending includes Regions branded consumer credit card accounts. Other consumer—exit portfolios includes lending initiatives through third parties consisting of loans made through automotive dealerships. Regions ceased originating new loans related to these businesses prior to 2020. Other consumer loans include other revolving consumer accounts, indirect and direct consumer loans, and overdrafts. Loans in this portfolio segment are sensitive to unemployment, inflation, and other key consumer economic measures. \nCREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS\nThe commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments' primary credit quality indicator is internal risk ratings which are detailed by categories related to underlying credit quality and probability of default. Regions assigns these risk ratings at loan origination and reviews the relationship utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis or at any time management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in this review process. These categories are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses.\n•\nPass—includes obligations where the probability of default is considered low;\n•\nSpecial Mention—includes obligations that have potential weakness that may, if not reversed or corrected, weaken the credit or inadequately protect the Company’s position at some future date. Obligations in this category may also be subject to economic or market conditions that may, in the future, have an adverse effect on debt service ability;\n•\nSubstandard Accrual—includes obligations that exhibit a well-defined weakness that presently jeopardizes debt repayment, even though they are currently performing. These obligations are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company may incur a loss in the future if these weaknesses are not corrected;\n•\nNon-accrual—includes obligations where management has determined that full payment of principal and interest is in doubt.\nSubstandard accrual and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to as “classified.” Special mention, substandard accrual, and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to as “criticized and classified.” \nRegions' consumer portfolio segment has various classes that present unique credit risks. Regions considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores, accrual status, days past due status, unemployment rates, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for the consumer loan portfolio. FICO scores are obtained at origination as part of Regions' formal underwriting process. Refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all consumer loans, including residential first mortgage loans. Current FICO data is not available for certain loans in the portfolio for various reasons; for example, if customers do not use sufficient credit, an updated score may not be available. These categories are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses. The higher the FICO score the less probability of default and vice versa.  \n119\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following tables present applicable credit quality indicators for the loan portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and gross charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, both by vintage year. Regions defines the vintage date for the purposes of disclosure as the date of the most recent credit decision. In general, renewals that are categorized as new credit decisions reflect the renewal date as the vintage date. Classes in the commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments are disclosed by risk rating. Classes in the consumer portfolio segment are disclosed by current FICO scores. \nDecember 31, 2024\nTerm Loans\nRevolving Loans \nRevolving Loans Converted to Amortizing\nOther

The collateral for commercial and investor real estate loans generally consists of all business assets including real estate, receivables and equipment. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had collateral-dependent residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines totaling $\n115\n million and $\n93\n million, respectively. The collateral for these loans are secured by residential real estate. Refer to Note 1 for additional details for the criteria of collateral dependent loans. \nMODIFICATIONS TO BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY \nThe majority of Regions' commercial and investor real estate modifications to troubled borrowers are the result of renewals of classified loans wherein there has been an interest rate reduction and/or maturity extension (that is considered other than insignificant). Similarly, Regions works to meet the individual needs of troubled consumer borrowers through its CAP. Regions designed the program to allow for customer-tailored modifications with the goal of keeping customers in their homes and avoiding foreclosure where possible. Modifications may be offered to any borrower experiencing financial hardship regardless of the borrower's payment status. Consumer modifications to troubled borrowers primarily involve an interest rate reduction and/or a payment deferral or maturity extension that is considered other than insignificant. All CAP modifications that involve an interest rate reduction, principal forgiveness, other than insignificant payment deferral or term extension and/or a combination of these are disclosed as modifications to troubled borrowers because the customer documents a financial hardship in order to participate. Refer to Note 1 for additional information regarding the Company's modifications to troubled borrowers.\nFor each portfolio segment and class, the following tables present the end of period balances of new modifications to troubled borrowers and the related percentage of the loan portfolio period-end balance by the type of modification in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n2024\nInterest Rate Reduction\nTerm Extension\nPayment Deferral\nTerm Extension and Interest Rate Reduction\nOther\nTotal\n$\n%\n(1)\n$\n%\n(1)\n$\n%\n(1)\n$\n%\n(1)\n$\n%\n(1)\n$\n%\n(1)\n(Dollars in millions)\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n$\n46\n \n0.09\n \n%\n$\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n$\n1\n \n—\n \n%\n$\n3\n \n0.01\n \n%\n$\n50\n \n0.10\n \n%\nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n3\n \n0.05\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n3\n \n0.05\n \n%\nTotal commercial\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n49\n \n0.09\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n1\n \n—\n \n%\n3\n \n0.01\n \n%\n53\n \n0.10\n \n%\nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n34\n \n0.52\n \n%\n111\n \n1.69\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n27\n \n0.42\n \n%\n172\n \n2.62\n \n%\nTotal investor real estate\n34\n \n0.39\n \n%\n111\n \n1.28\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n27\n \n0.31\n \n%\n172\n \n1.98\n \n%\nResidential first mortgage\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n156\n \n0.78\n \n%\n2\n \n0.01\n \n%\n6\n \n0.03\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n164\n \n0.82\n \n%\nHome equity lines\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n1\n \n0.02\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n9\n \n0.29\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n10\n \n0.30\n \n%\nHome equity loans\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n4\n \n0.17\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n8\n \n0.34\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n12\n \n0.51\n \n%\nTotal consumer\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n161\n \n0.49\n \n%\n2\n \n0.01\n \n%\n23\n \n0.07\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n186\n \n0.56\n \n%\n$\n34\n \n0.04\n \n%\n$\n321\n \n0.33\n \n%\n$\n2\n \n—\n \n%\n$\n24\n \n0.02\n \n%\n$\n30\n \n0.03\n \n%\n$\n411\n \n0.43\n \n%\n126\nTable of Contents\n \n2023\nTerm Extension\nPayment Deferral\nTerm Extension and Interest Rate Reduction\nTerm Extension and Payment Deferral\nTotal\n$\n%\n(1)\n$\n%\n(1)\n$\n%\n(1)\n$\n%\n(1)\n$\n%\n(1)\n(Dollars in millions)\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n379\n \n0.75\n \n%\n$\n139\n \n0.27\n \n%\n$\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n$\n37\n \n0.07\n \n%\n$\n555\n \n1.09\n \n%\nCommercial real estate mortgage—owner-occupied\n3\n \n0.05\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n3\n \n0.06\n \n%\nCommercial real estate construction—owner-occupied\n2\n \n0.67\n \n%\n1\n \n0.15\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n3\n \n0.81\n \n%\nTotal commercial\n384\n \n0.68\n \n%\n140\n \n0.25\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n37\n \n0.07\n \n%\n561\n \n1.00\n \n%\nCommercial investor real estate mortgage\n213\n \n3.23\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n213\n \n3.23\n \n%\nTotal investor real estate\n213\n \n2.41\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n213\n \n2.41\n \n%\nResidential first mortgage\n94\n \n0.46\n \n%\n2\n \n0.01\n \n%\n3\n \n0.02\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n99\n \n0.49\n \n%\nHome equity lines\n1\n \n0.02\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n4\n \n0.11\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n5\n \n0.13\n \n%\nHome equity loans\n4\n \n0.17\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n5\n \n0.18\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n9\n \n0.35\n \n%\nTotal consumer\n99\n \n0.29\n \n%\n2\n \n0.01\n \n%\n12\n \n0.03\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n113\n \n0.34\n \n%\nTotal\n$\n696\n \n0.71\n \n%\n$\n142\n \n0.14\n \n%\n$\n12\n \n0.01\n \n%\n$\n37\n \n0.04\n \n%\n$\n887\n \n0.90\n \n%\n____\n(1) Amounts calculated based upon whole dollar values.\nThe end of period balance of unfunded commitments related to modifications to troubled borrowers was $\n71\n million and  $\n106\n million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe following tables present the financial impact of modifications to troubled borrowers during years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 by portfolio segment, class of financing receivable, and the type of modification.

SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS \nRESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES\nThe fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates, servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.\nThe table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value measurement method for the years ended December 31:\n \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nCarrying value, beginning of year\n$\n906\n \n$\n812\n \n$\n418\n \nAdditions\n26\n \n27\n \n44\n \nPurchases\n (1)\n138\n \n158\n \n301\n \nIncrease (decrease) in fair value\n(2)\n:\nDue to change in valuation inputs or assumptions\n60\n \n17\n \n127\n \nEconomic amortization associated with borrower repayments\n (3)\n(\n123\n)\n(\n108\n)\n(\n78\n)\nCarrying value, end of year\n$\n1,007\n \n$\n906\n \n$\n812\n \n_________\n(1)\nPurchases of residential MSRs can be structured with cash hold back provisions, therefore the timing of payment may be made in future periods.\n(2)\nIncluded in mortgage income. Amounts presented exclude offsetting impact from related derivatives.\n(3)\nIncludes both total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. Regions' MSR decay methodology is a discounted net cash flow approach.\n \nData and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the valuation’s sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs (excluding related derivative instruments) as of December 31 are as follows:\n \n \n2024\n2023\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nUnpaid principal balance\n$\n67,546\n \n$\n62,059\n \nWeighted-average CPR (%)\n8.0\n \n%\n8.2\n \n%\nEstimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase\n$\n(\n37\n)\n$\n(\n43\n)\nEstimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase\n$\n(\n78\n)\n$\n(\n79\n)\nOption-adjusted spread (basis points)\n505\n \n482\n \nEstimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase\n$\n(\n22\n)\n$\n(\n19\n)\nEstimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase\n$\n(\n45\n)\n$\n(\n39\n)\nWeighted-average coupon interest rate\n3.8\n \n%\n3.8\n \n%\nWeighted-average remaining maturity (months)\n296\n302\nWeighted-average servicing fee (basis points)\n27.3\n \n27.4\n \nThe sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the residential MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.\nServicing related fees, which include contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income resulting from the servicing of residential mortgage loans totaled $\n191\n million, $\n165\n million, and $\n137\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.\nResidential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are breached.\nRegions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and reflects management’s estimate of losses based on historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends. Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. \n129\nTable of Contents\n \nCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES \nRegions engages in the servicing of commercial mortgage loans through agreements with the agencies and through a DUS lending program. Commercial MSRs of loans through the agency programs are measured at fair value while commercial MSRs of loans through the DUS lending program are measured at cost and subsequently amortized. \nCommercial mortgage banking through non-DUS agency programs\nThe fair value of commercial MSRs through non-DUS agency programs is calculated using various assumptions including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates, servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of mortgages in this servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying amount of these commercial MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. Regions assumes a loss share guarantee associated with loans sold to Fannie Mae. See Note 1 for additional information. Also see Note 23 for additional information related to the guarantee.\nThe table below presents an analysis of commercial MSRs through the agency programs under the fair value measurement method for the years ended December 31:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nCarrying value, beginning of year\n$\n81\n \n$\n78\n \n$\n62\n \nAdditions\n23\n5\n18\nIncrease (decrease) in fair value\n(1)\n:\nDue to change in valuation inputs or assumptions\n9\n \n13\n \n12\n \nEconomic amortization associated with borrower repayments\n (2)\n(\n16\n)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n14\n)\nCarrying value, end of year\n$\n97\n \n$\n81\n \n$\n78\n \n_____\n(1)\nIncluded in capital markets income. Amounts presented exclude offsetting impact from related derivatives.\n(2)\nIncludes both total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. Regions' MSR decay methodology is a discounted net cash flow approach.\n \nData and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the valuation’s sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to commercial MSRs through non-DUS agency programs (excluding related derivative instruments) as of December 31 are as follows: \n2024\n2023\n(Dollars in millions)\nUnpaid principal balance\n$\n7,425\n \n$\n5,913\n \nWeighted-average CPR (%)\n7.7\n \n%\n8.1\n \n%\nEstimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase\n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n(\n1\n)\nEstimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase\n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n(\n2\n)\nWeighted-average discount rate (%)\n7.1\n \n%\n7.1\n \n%\nEstimated impact on fair value of a 10% increase\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n(\n2\n)\nEstimated impact on fair value of a 20% increase\n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n(\n4\n)\nWeighted-average coupon interest rate\n4.7\n \n%\n4.3\n \n%\nWeighted-average remaining maturity (months)\n150\n161\nWeighted-average servicing fee (basis points)\n26.4\n30.1\nThe sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the commercial MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above.\nServicing related fees, which include contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income resulting from the servicing of commercial mortgage loans through the agency programs totaled $\n24\n million, $\n22\n million, and $\n19\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.\n130\nTable of Contents\n \nCommercial mortgage banking through the DUS lending program\nRegions is an approved DUS lender. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-family housing market. In connection with the DUS program, Regions services commercial mortgage loans, retains commercial MSRs and intangible assets associated with the DUS license, and assumes a loss share guarantee associated with the loans. See Note 1 for additional information. Also see Note 23 for additional information related to the guarantee.\nThe table below presents an analysis of commercial DUS MSRs under the amortization measurement method for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nCarrying value, beginning of year\n$\n87\n \n$\n81\n \n$\n86\n \nAdditions\n20\n \n21\n \n12\n \nEconomic amortization associated with borrower repayments\n (1)\n(\n17\n)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n17\n)\nCarrying value, end of year\n$\n90\n \n$\n87\n \n$\n81\n \n________\n(1)\nEconomic amortization associated with borrower repayments includes both total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns. \nRegions periodically evaluates DUS MSRs for impairment based on fair value. The estimated fair value of the DUS MSRs was approximately $\n117\n million, $\n109\n million, and $\n96\n million at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. \nServicing related fees in connection with the DUS program, which include contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income resulting from the servicing of DUS commercial mortgage loans totaled $\n26\n million, $\n23\n million, and $\n24\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nNOTE 7. OTHER EARNING ASSETS    \nOther earning assets consist of investments in Federal Reserve Bank stock, FHLB stock, marketable equity securities and other miscellaneous earning assets. \nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK AND FHLB STOCK\nThe following table presents the amount of Regions' investments in Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock as of December 31:\n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nFederal Reserve Bank stock\n$\n492\n \n$\n434\n \nFHLB stock\n140\n \n18\n \nMARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarketable equity securities carried at fair value, which primarily consist of assets held for certain employee benefits and money market funds, are reported in other earning assets. Total marketable equity securities were $\n819\n million and $\n813\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Unrealized gains recognized in earnings for marketable equity securities still being held by the Company were $\n25\n million and $\n15\n million during 2024 and 2023, respectively. Unrealized losses recognized in earnings for marketable equity securities still being held by the Company were $\n45\n million during 2022. \nOTHER MISCELLANEOUS EARNING ASSETS\nOther miscellaneous earning assets consist of long-term certificates of deposit at other institutions and other receivables. Other miscellaneous earning assets were $\n165\n million and $\n152\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nNOTE 8.

See Note 1 for additional information on the qualitative assessment. The results of the annual test indicated that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount as of the test date; therefore, a quantitative goodwill impairment test was deemed unnecessary.\nOTHER IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following table presents other identifiable intangible assets and related accumulated amortization as of December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Amount\n \n(In millions)\nCore deposit intangibles\n$\n1,011\n \n$\n1,011\n \n$\n1,011\n \n$\n1,010\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \nPurchased credit card relationship assets\n175\n \n175\n \n173\n \n169\n \n2\n \n6\n \nRelationship assets\n (1)\n267\n \n267\n \n120\n \n90\n \n147\n \n177\n \nOther—amortizing \n(2)\n26\n \n26\n \n25\n \n24\n \n1\n \n2\n \nAgency commercial real estate licenses \n(3)\n16\n \n16\n—\n \n—\n \n16\n \n16\n \nOther—non-amortizing \n(4)\n3\n \n3\n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \n3\n \n$\n1,498\n \n$\n1,498\n \n$\n1,329\n \n$\n1,293\n \n$\n169\n \n$\n205\n \n_________\n(1)\nIncludes intangible assets related to broker and contractor origination networks, vendor networks, and customer relationships. \n(2)\nIncludes intangible assets primarily related to acquired trust services, trade names, intellectual property, and employee agreements.\n(3)\nIncludes a DUS license acquired in 2014 and commercial real estate licenses acquired in 2021 that are non-amortizing intangible assets.

Payment of the principal of the notes may be accelerated only in the case of certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings or reorganization of the Company. The subordinated notes described \n133\nTable of Contents\n \nabove qualify as Tier 2 capital under Federal Reserve guidelines, subject to diminishing credit as the respective maturity dates approach and subject to certain transition provisions. None of the subordinated notes are redeemable prior to maturity, unless there is an occurrence of a qualifying capital event.\nOn June 3, 2024, Regions issued $\n750\n million of \n5.722\n% fixed rate to floating rate senior notes due June 2030. The notes will initially bear interest at 5.722% per annum and, commencing on June 6, 2029 in conjunction with the call date, the notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to Compounded SOFR plus \n1.49\n%%.  \nOn September 3, 2024, Regions issued $\n1.0\n billion of \n5.502\n% fixed rate to floating rate senior notes due September 2035. The notes will initially bear interest at 5.502% per annum and, commencing on September 6, 2034 in conjunction with the call date, the notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to Compounded SOFR plus \n2.06\n%%.  \nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company's \n7.75\n% subordinated notes matured. \nFHLB advances at December 31, 2024 had a weighted-average interest rate of \n4.6\n percent with remaining maturity within one year. Funding from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank is secured by pledged assets, primarily certain loan portfolios which are also subject to blanket lien arrangements with the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. As of December 31, 2024, Regions' blanket lien arrangements with these entities covered a total loan balance of approximately $\n93.6\n billion and included loans from various loan portfolios. However, borrowing capacity with the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank is contingent on a subset of the blanket lien portfolios which are eligible and pledged according to the parameters for each counterparty.\nRegions uses derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risk by converting a portion of its fixed-rate debt to a variable-rate. The effective rate adjustments related to these hedges are included in interest expense on long-term borrowings. The weighted-average interest rate on total long-term debt, including the effect of derivative instruments, was \n6.3\n percent, \n6.5\n percent, and \n5.1\n percent for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note 20.\nThe aggregate amount of contractual maturities of all long-term debt in each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31\n \nRegions\nFinancial\nCorporation\n(Parent)\nRegions\nBank\n \n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n891\n \n$\n2,000\n \n2026\n—\n \n—\n \n2027\n—\n \n—\n \n2028\n581\n \n—\n \n2029\n—\n \n—\n \nThereafter\n2,023\n \n498\n \n$\n3,495\n \n$\n2,498\n \nOn February 24, 2022, Regions filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC. This shelf registration does not have a capacity limit and can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. The registration statement will expire in February 2025. Regions expects to file a new shelf registration statement on or about February 21, 2025.\nRegions Bank may issue bank notes from time to time, either as part of a bank note program or as stand-alone issuances.  Notes issued by Regions Bank may be senior or subordinated notes.  Notes issued by Regions Bank are not deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC.\nRegions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some securities.\n134\nTable of Contents\n \nNOTE 12. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS \nRegions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. Regions is a \"Category IV\" institution under the Federal Reserve's Tailoring rules.\nBanking regulations identify five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Regions and Regions Bank exceeded all current regulatory requirements, and were classified as \"well-capitalized.\" Management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2024 that would change this designation. \nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require institutions to maintain minimum ratios of common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (the \"Leverage\" ratio).\nFederal banking agencies allowed a phase-in of the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. At December 31, 2021, the add-back to regulatory capital was calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. The amount is phased-in over a three-year period beginning in 2022 and will conclude in the first quarter of 2025. At December 31, 2024, the net impact of the add-back on CET1 was approximately $\n102\n million or approximately \n8\n basis points.\nRegions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at \n2.5\n percent. See Note 14 for further details regarding CCAR results.\nThe following tables summarize the applicable holding company and bank regulatory capital requirements: \n \nDecember 31, 2024\n(1)\nMinimum Requirement\nMinimum Requirement plus SCB\n (2)\nTo Be Well\nCapitalized\n \nAmount\nRatio\n(Dollars in millions)\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital:\nRegions Financial Corporation\n$\n13,434\n \n10.80\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\n7.00\n \n%\nN/A\nRegions Bank\n14,035\n \n11.32\n \n4.50\n \n7.00\n \n6.50\n \n%\nTier 1 capital:\nRegions Financial Corporation\n$\n15,149\n \n12.17\n \n%\n6.00\n \n%\n8.50\n \n%\n6.00\n \n%\nRegions Bank\n14,035\n \n11.32\n \n6.00\n \n8.50\n \n8.00\n \nTotal capital:\nRegions Financial Corporation\n$\n17,500\n \n14.06\n \n%\n8.00\n \n%\n10.50\n \n%\n10.00\n \n%\nRegions Bank\n16,081\n \n12.97\n \n8.00\n \n10.50\n \n10.00\n \nLeverage capital:\nRegions Financial Corporation\n$\n15,149\n \n9.88\n \n%\n4.00\n \n%\n4.00\n \n%\nN/A\nRegions Bank\n14,035\n \n9.21\n \n4.00\n \n4.00\n \n5.00\n \n%\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nMinimum Requirement\nMinimum Requirement plus SCB\n (2)\nTo Be Well\nCapitalized\n \nAmount\nRatio\n(Dollars in millions)\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital:\nRegions Financial Corporation\n$\n12,976\n \n10.26\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\n7.00\n \n%\nN/A\nRegions Bank\n14,136\n \n11.22\n \n4.50\n \n7.00\n \n6.50\n \n%\nTier 1 capital:\nRegions Financial Corporation\n$\n14,635\n \n11.57\n \n%\n6.00\n \n%\n8.50\n \n%\n6.00\n \n%\nRegions Bank\n14,136\n \n11.22\n \n6.00\n \n8.50\n \n8.00\n \nTotal capital:\nRegions Financial Corporation\n$\n16,885\n \n13.35\n \n%\n8.00\n \n%\n10.50\n \n%\n10.00\n \n%\nRegions Bank\n16,057\n \n12.74\n \n8.00\n \n10.50\n \n10.00\n \nLeverage capital:\nRegions Financial Corporation\n$\n14,635\n \n9.72\n \n%\n4.00\n \n%\n4.00\n \n%\nN/A\nRegions Bank\n14,136\n \n9.44\n \n4.00\n \n4.00\n \n5.00\n \n%\n _________\n(1)\nThe 2024 Basel III CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, and Leverage capital ratios are estimated\n(2)\nReflects Regions' SCB of 2.50%.

The primary source of operating cash available to Regions is provided by dividends from subsidiaries. Statutory limits are placed on the amount of dividends the subsidiary bank can pay without prior regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory authorities require the maintenance of minimum capital-to-asset ratios at banking subsidiaries. Under the Federal Reserve’s Regulation H, Regions Bank may not, without approval of the Federal Reserve, declare or pay a dividend to Regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year exceeds the total of (a) Regions Bank’s net income for that year and (b) its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to additional paid-in capital or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock. Under Alabama law, Regions Bank may not pay a dividend to Regions in excess of 90 percent of its net earnings until the bank’s surplus is equal to at least 20 percent of capital. Regions Bank is also required by Alabama law to seek the approval of the Alabama Superintendent of Banking prior to paying a dividend to Regions if the total of all dividends declared by Regions Bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (a) Regions Bank’s net earnings for that year, plus (b) its retained net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The statute defines net earnings as “the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal, state and local taxes.” In addition to dividend restrictions, Federal statutes also prohibit unsecured loans from banking subsidiaries to the parent company.\nIn addition, Regions must adhere to various HUD regulatory guidelines including required minimum capital to maintain their HUD approved status. Failure to comply with the HUD guidelines could result in withdrawal of this certification. As of December 31, 2024, Regions was in compliance with HUD guidelines. Regions is also subject to various capital requirements by secondary market investors.\nNOTE 13. LEASES \nLESSEE\nAs of December 31, 2024, \nassets\n and \nliabilities\n recorded under operating leases for properties were $\n453\n million and $\n527\n million, respectively, and $\n462\n million and $\n535\n million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The difference between the asset and liability balance is largely driven by increases in rent over the lease term and any strategic decisions to exit a lease location early, resulting in derecognition of the asset. The asset is recorded within other assets, and the lease liability is recorded within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense, which is operating lease costs recorded within net occupancy expense, was $\n86\n million, $\n85\n million, and $\n86\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.\nOther information related to operating leases at December 31 is as follows: \n \n2024\n2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\n9.2\n years\n9.6\n years\nWeighted-average discount rate (%)\n3.1\n \n%\n2.9\n \n%\nFuture, undiscounted minimum lease payments on operating leases are as follows: \n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n96\n \n2026\n88\n \n2027\n76\n \n2028\n65\n \n2029\n52\n \nThereafter\n242\n \nTotal lease payments\n619\n \nLess: Imputed interest\n92\n \nTotal present value of lease liabilities\n$\n527\n \n136\nTable of Contents\n \nLESSOR\nThe following tables present a summary of Regions' sales-type, direct financing and leveraged leases for the years ended December 31. \nNet Interest Income\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nSales-Type and Direct Financing\n$\n88\n \n$\n65\n \n$\n52\n \nLeveraged\n(1)\n8\n \n2\n \n12\n \n$\n96\n \n$\n67\n \n$\n64\n \n_________\n(1)\nLeveraged lease income is shown pre-tax and related tax expense is immaterial for all periods presented.

The Company incurred $\n11\n million of issuance costs associated with the transaction with an initial partial dividend occurring in the third quarter. The Series B preferred stock was redeemed in the third quarter of 2024. Upon redemption, additional paid-in-capital was reduced by $\n52\n million related to Series B preferred dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, and net income available to common shareholders was reduced by $\n15\n million related to issuance costs.\nThe Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $\n91\n million and $\n98\n million on Series B, Series C, Series D, and Series E of preferred stock during 2024 and 2023, respectively. The board declared $\n13\n million in cash dividends on Series F preferred stock during 2024; the initial quarterly cash dividend for Series F preferred stock was declared in the third quarter of 2024. In total, the Board of Directors declared $\n104\n million and $\n98\n million in cash dividends on preferred stock in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIn the event Series C, Series D, Series E, or Series F preferred shares are redeemed in full at their respective liquidation amounts, $\n10\n million, $\n4\n million, $\n10\n million, or $\n11\n million in excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will be recognized, respectively. These excess amounts represent issuance costs that were recorded as reductions to preferred stock, including related surplus, and will be recorded as reductions to net income available to common shareholders. \nCOMMON STOCK\nThe Company's results of the 2024 stress test from the Federal Reserve reflect that the Company exceeded all minimum capital levels. The Company's SCB will remain floored at \n2.5\n percent from the fourth quarter of 2024 through the third quarter of 2025.\nOn April 20, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $\n2.5\n billion of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Regions had repurchased approximately \n34\n million shares of common stock at a total cost of $\n614\n million under this plan. All of these shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock. On December 10, 2024, the Board authorized an extension of the common stock repurchase program through the fourth quarter of 2025. \nRegions declared $\n0.98\n per share in cash dividends for 2024, $\n0.88\n per common share for 2023, and $\n0.74\n for 2022. \n138\nTable of Contents\n \nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nThe following tables present the balances and activity in AOCI

See Note 14\n \nfor additional details.\n \n141\nTable of Contents\n \nThe effects from the assumed exercise of restricted stock units and awards and performance stock units totaling \n5\n million, \n6\n million, and \n4\n million for years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, were not included in the above computations of diluted earnings per common share because such amounts would have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per common share.\n \nNOTE 16. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\nRegions administers long-term incentive compensation plans that permit the granting of incentive awards in the form of  restricted stock awards, performance awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights. No stock options were outstanding during 2024, 2023 or 2022. While Regions has the ability to issue stock appreciation rights, none have been issued to date. The terms of all awards issued under these plans are determined by the CHR Committee of the Board; however, no awards may be granted after the tenth anniversary from the date the plans were initially approved by shareholders. Incentive awards usually vest based on employee service, generally within \nthree years\n from the date of the grant. \nOn April 23, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the Regions Financial Corporation 2015 LTIP, which permits the Company to grant to employees and directors various forms of incentive compensation. These forms of incentive compensation are similar to the types of compensation approved in prior plans. The 2015 LTIP authorizes \n60\n million common share equivalents available for grant, where grants of options and grants of full value awards (e.g., shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units) count as one share equivalent. Unless otherwise determined by the CHR Committee of the Board, grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance stock units accrue dividends, or their notional equivalent, as they are declared by the Board, and are paid upon vesting of the award. Upon adoption of the 2015 LTIP, Regions closed the prior long-term incentive plan to new grants, and, accordingly, prospective grants must be made under the 2015 LTIP or a successor plan. All existing grants under prior long-term incentive plans are unaffected by adoption of the 2015 LTIP. The number of remaining share equivalents available for future issuance under the 2015 LTIP was approximately \n21\n million at December 31, 2024.\nGrants of performance-based restricted stock typically have a \nthree-year\n performance period, and shares vest within \nthree years\n after the grant date. Restricted stock units typically vest over \nthree years\n. Grantees of restricted stock awards or units must either remain employed with the Company for certain periods from the date of grant in order for shares to be released or issued or retire after meeting the standards of a retiree, at which time shares would be issued and released. Regions issues new shares from authorized reserves upon exercise. \nThe following table summarizes the elements of compensation cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nCompensation cost of share-based compensation awards:\nRestricted and performance stock awards\n$\n73\n \n$\n61\n \n$\n60\n \nTax benefits related to share-based compensation cost\n(\n18\n)\n(\n16\n)\n(\n15\n)\nCompensation cost of share-based compensation awards, net of tax\n$\n55\n \n$\n45\n \n$\n45\n \nRESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, Regions made restricted stock grants that vest based upon satisfaction of service conditions and restricted stock award and performance stock award grants that vest based upon satisfaction of both service conditions and performance conditions. Incremental shares earned above the performance target associated with previous performance stock awards are included when and if performance targets are achieved.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS \nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nRegions' defined benefit pension plans cover only certain employees as the pension plans are closed to new entrants. Benefits under the pension plans are based on years of service and the employee’s highest five consecutive years of compensation during the last ten years of employment. Regions’ funding policy is to contribute annually at least the amount required by IRS minimum funding standards. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future. \nThe Company also sponsors a SERP, which is a non-qualified pension plan that provides certain senior executive officers defined benefits in relation to their compensation. Actuarially determined pension expense is charged to current operations using the projected unit credit method. All defined benefit plans are referred to as “the plans” throughout the remainder of this footnote.\n143\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table sets forth the plans’ change in benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status, using a December 31 measurement date, and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31:\n \n \nQualified Plans\nNon-qualified Plans\nTotal\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nChange in benefit obligation\nProjected benefit obligation, beginning of year\n$\n1,644\n \n$\n1,623\n \n$\n82\n \n$\n127\n \n$\n1,726\n \n$\n1,750\n \nService cost\n22\n \n21\n \n1\n \n1\n \n23\n \n22\n \nInterest cost\n82\n \n86\n \n4\n \n6\n \n86\n \n92\n \nActuarial (gains) losses \n(\n52\n)\n49\n \n3\n \n14\n \n(\n49\n)\n63\n \nBenefit payments \n(\n157\n)\n(\n132\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n164\n)\n(\n140\n)\nAdministrative expenses\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nPlan settlements\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n9\n)\n(\n58\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n58\n)\nProjected benefit obligation, end of year\n$\n1,536\n \n$\n1,644\n \n$\n74\n \n$\n82\n \n$\n1,610\n \n$\n1,726\n \nChange in plan assets\nFair value of plan assets, beginning of year\n$\n1,936\n \n$\n1,970\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,936\n \n$\n1,970\n \nActual return on plan assets\n98\n \n101\n \n—\n \n—\n \n98\n \n101\n \nCompany contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n16\n \n66\n \n16\n \n66\n \nBenefit payments \n(\n157\n)\n(\n132\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n164\n)\n(\n140\n)\nAdministrative expenses\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nPlan settlements\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n9\n)\n(\n58\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n58\n)\nFair value of plan assets, end of year\n$\n1,874\n \n$\n1,936\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,874\n \n$\n1,936\n \nFunded status and accrued benefit (cost) at measurement date\n$\n338\n \n$\n292\n \n$\n(\n74\n)\n$\n(\n82\n)\n$\n264\n \n$\n210\n \nAmount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nOther assets\n$\n338\n \n$\n292\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n338\n \n$\n292\n \nOther liabilities\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n74\n)\n(\n82\n)\n(\n74\n)\n(\n82\n)\n$\n338\n \n$\n292\n \n$\n(\n74\n)\n$\n(\n82\n)\n$\n264\n \n$\n210\n \nPre-tax amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Income) Loss:\nNet actuarial loss \n$\n529\n \n$\n580\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n555\n \n$\n609\n \nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the qualified plans was $\n1.5\n billion and $\n1.6\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

This provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. \nThe expected long-term rate of return on the qualified plans' assets is based on an estimated reasonable range of probable returns. The assumption is established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the qualified plans and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. Management chose a point within the range based on the probability of achievement combined with incremental returns attributable to active management. For 2025, the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is \n6.61\n percent, using the weighted fair value of plan assets as of December 31, 2024.\nThe qualified plans' investment strategy is continuing to shift from focusing on maximizing asset returns to minimizing funding ratio volatility, with a planned increase in the allocation to fixed income securities. The combined target asset allocation is \n33\n percent equities, \n62\n percent fixed income securities and \n5\n percent in all other types of investments. Equity securities include investments in large and small/mid cap companies primarily located in the U.S., international equities, and private equities. Fixed income securities include investments in corporate and government bonds, asset-backed securities and any other fixed income investments as allowed by respective prospectuses and other offering documents. Other types of investments may include hedge funds and real estate funds that follow several different strategies. The plans' assets are highly diversified with respect to asset class, security and manager. Investment risk is controlled with the plans' assets rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and continual monitoring of investment managers’ performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager.\nRegions’ qualified plans have a portion of their investments in Regions' common stock. At December 31, 2024, the plans held \n2,855,618\n shares, which represents a total market value of approximately $\n67\n million, or approximately \n4\n percent of the plans' assets.\nThe following table presents the fair value of Regions’ qualified pension plans’ financial assets as of December 31:\n \n2024\n2023\n \nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nFair Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nFair Value\n \n(In millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n27\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n74\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n74\n \nFixed income securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities\n$\n362\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n362\n \n$\n359\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n359\n \nFederal agency securities\n—\n \n11\n \n—\n \n11\n \n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \n7\n \nCorporate bonds and other debt\n—\n \n606\n \n—\n \n606\n \n—\n \n603\n \n—\n \n603\n \nTotal fixed income securities\n$\n362\n \n$\n617\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n979\n \n$\n359\n \n$\n610\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n969\n \nDomestic equity securities\n$\n124\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n124\n \n$\n132\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n132\n \nInternational mutual funds\n$\n90\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n103\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n103\n \nTotal assets in the fair value hierarchy\n$\n603\n \n$\n617\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,220\n \n$\n668\n \n$\n610\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,278\n \nCollective trust funds:\nFixed income fund \n(1)\n$\n117\n \n$\n111\n \nCommon stock fund \n(1)\n126\n \n119\n \nInternational fund \n(1)\n120\n \n117\n \nTotal collective trust funds\n$\n363\n \n$\n347\n \nReal estate funds measured at NAV \n(1)\n119\n \n144\n \nPrivate equity funds measured at NAV \n(1)\n172\n \n167\n \n$\n1,874\n \n$\n1,936\n \n__________\n(1)\nIn accordance with accounting guidance, investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of amounts reported in the fair value hierarchy to amounts reported on the balance sheet.\n \n145\nTable of Contents\n \nInvestments held in the plans are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. For all investments, the plans attempt to use quoted market prices of identical assets on active exchanges, or Level 1 measurements. Where such quoted market prices are not available, the plans typically employ quoted market prices of similar instruments (including matrix pricing) and/or discounted cash flows to estimate a value of these securities, or Level 2 measurements. Level 2 discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on market interest rates, prepayment speeds and/or option adjusted spreads. See Note 1 for a description of valuation methodologies related to U.S. Treasuries, federal agency securities, and equity securities. The methodology described in Note 1 for other debt securities is applicable to corporate bonds and other debt.\nMutual funds are valued based on quoted market prices of identical assets on active exchanges; these valuations are Level 1 measurements. Collective trust funds, real estate funds, private equity funds and other assets are valued based on net asset value or the valuation of the limited partner’s portion of the equity of the fund. Third party fund managers provide these valuations based primarily on estimated valuations of underlying investments. \nInformation about the expected cash flows for the qualified and non-qualified plans is as follows:\nQualified Plans\nNon-qualified Plans\n \n(In millions)\nExpected Employer Contributions:\n2025\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nExpected Benefit Payments:\n2025\n$\n123\n \n$\n8\n \n2026\n124\n \n8\n \n2027\n126\n \n7\n \n2028\n125\n \n8\n \n2029\n123\n \n8\n \nNext five years\n587\n \n34\n \nOTHER PLANS\nRegions has a defined-contribution 401(k) plan that includes a Company match of eligible employee contributions. Eligible employees include those who have been employed for \none year\n and have worked a minimum of \n1,000\n hours. The Company match is invested based on the employees' allocation elections. Regions provides an automatic \n2\n percent cash 401(k) contribution to eligible employees regardless of whether or not they are contributing to the 401(k) plan. To receive this contribution, employees must be employed at the end of the year and not actively accruing a benefit in the Regions’ pension plans. Regions’ cash contribution was approximately $\n27\n million for 2024, $\n24\n million for 2023, and $\n22\n million for 2022. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, eligible employees who were already contributing to the 401(k) plan received up to a \n5\n percent Company match plus the automatic \n2\n percent cash contribution. Regions’ match to the 401(k) plan on behalf of employees totaled $\n73\n million in 2024, $\n72\n million in 2023, and $\n67\n million in 2022. Regions’ 401(k) plan held \n14\n million and \n16\n million shares of Regions' common stock at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 401(k) plan received approximately $\n15\n million, $\n13\n million, and $\n12\n million in dividends on Regions' common stock for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nRegions also sponsors defined benefit postretirement health care plans that cover certain retired employees. For these certain employees retiring before normal retirement age, the Company currently pays a portion of the costs of certain health care benefits until the retired employee becomes eligible for Medicare. Certain retirees, participating in plans of acquired entities, are offered a Medicare supplemental benefit. The plan is contributory and contains other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and co-payments. Retiree health care benefits, as well as similar benefits for active employees, are provided through a self-insured program in which Company and retiree costs are based on the amount of benefits paid. The Company’s policy is to fund the Company’s share of the cost of health care benefits in amounts determined at the discretion of management. Postretirement life insurance is also provided to a grandfathered group of employees and retirees.\n \n146\nTable of Contents\n \nNOTE 18.

The Company is in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process program and examinations of the U.S federal consolidated income tax return for tax years through 2022 have been completed. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local tax examinations for tax years prior to 2020. Currently, there are no material disputed tax positions with federal or state taxing authorities. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate that any adjustments relating to federal or state tax examinations will result in material changes to its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n It is reasonably possible that the liability for UTBs could decrease by as much as $\n8\n million and be recognized due to the expiration of statute of limitations during the next twelve months.\nAs of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the balances of the Company’s UTBs that would reduce the effective tax rates, if recognized, were $\n12\n million, $\n11\n million and $\n8\n million, respectively.\nInterest and penalties related to UTBs are recorded in the provision for income taxes. For each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized an immaterial expense (benefit) for gross interest and penalties related to its UTBs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an immaterial gross liability for interest and penalties related to UTBs.\nNOTE 20.

The net basis takes into account the impact of cash collateral received or posted, legally enforceable master netting agreements, and variation margin that allow Regions to settle derivative contracts with the counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net position with the related cash collateral. Cash collateral, all of which is included as a netting adjustment, totaled $\n106\n million and $\n243\n million for derivative assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash collateral totaled $\n87\n million and $\n43\n million for derivative liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nHEDGING DERIVATIVES\nDerivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives. Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. See Note 1 for additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives. \nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nFair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment. \nRegions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposure on the Company’s fixed-rate borrowings and time deposits. These agreements involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments over the life of the agreements. Regions also enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-rate prepayable and non-prepayable debt securities available for sale. These agreements involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest receipts.\nCASH FLOW HEDGES\nCash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. \nRegions enters into interest rate swaps, options (e.g., floors, caps and collars), and agreements with a combination of these instruments to manage overall cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on variable rate loans. The agreements effectively modify the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing receive fixed/pay SOFR interest rate swaps and interest rate options. As of December 31, 2024, Regions was hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows into 2034.\nAs of December 31, 2024, cash flow hedges were held at a pre-tax net loss of $\n662\n million, which includes pre-tax net gains of $\n29\n million related to terminated cash flow floors and swaps. Regions expects to reclassify into earnings approximately $\n203\n million in pre-tax losses due to the net receipt/ payment of interest and amortization on all cash flow hedges within the next twelve months. Included in this amount is $\n30\n million in pre-tax net gains related to the amortization of terminated cash flow floors and swaps. \nThe following tables present the effect of hedging derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of income and the total amounts for the respective line items affected:\n2024\nInterest Income\nInterest Expense\nDebt securities\nLoans, including fees\nLong-term borrowings\nDeposits\n(In millions)\nTotal income (expense) presented in the consolidated statements of income\n$\n925\n \n$\n5,732\n \n$\n(279)\n$\n(1,971)\nGains/(losses) on fair value hedging relationships:\nInterest rate contracts:\nAmounts related to interest settlements on derivatives\n$\n8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n67\n)\n(\n1\n)\nRecognized on derivatives\n27\n \n—\n \n22\n \n—\n \nRecognized on hedged items\n(\n27\n)\n—\n \n(\n22\n)\n—\n \nIncome (expense) recognized on fair value hedges\n$\n8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n67\n)\n$\n(\n1\n)\nGains/(losses) on cash flow hedging relationships:\n(1)\nInterest rate contracts:\nRealized gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income\n (2)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n420\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nIncome (expense) recognized on cash flow hedges\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n420\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n150\nTable of Contents\n \n2023\nInterest Income\nInterest Expense\nDebt securities\nLoans, including fees\nLong-term borrowings\n(In millions)\nTotal income (expense) presented in the consolidated statements of income\n$\n749\n \n$\n5,733\n \n$\n(226)\nGains/(losses) on fair value hedging relationships:\nInterest rate contracts:\n   Amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives\n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n64\n)\n   Recognized on derivatives\n(\n6\n)\n—\n \n46\n \n   Recognized on hedged items\n6\n \n—\n \n(\n46\n)\nIncome (expense) recognized on fair value hedges\n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n64\n)\nGains/(losses) on cash flow hedging relationships: \n(1)\nInterest rate contracts:\nRealized gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income \n(2)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n236\n)\n$\n—\n \nIncome (expense) recognized on cash flow hedges\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n236\n)\n$\n—\n \n2022\nInterest Income\nInterest Expense\nDebt securities\nLoans, including fees\nLong-term borrowings\n(In millions)\nTotal income (expense) presented in the consolidated statements of income\n$\n688\n \n$\n4,088\n \n$\n(119)\nGains/(losses) on fair value hedging relationships:\nInterest rate contracts:\n   Amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives\n$\n41\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\n   Recognized on derivatives\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n124\n)\n   Recognized on hedged items\n—\n \n—\n \n124\n \nIncome (expense) recognized on fair value hedges\n$\n41\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\nGains/(losses) on cash flow hedging relationships: \n(1)\nInterest rate contracts:\nRealized gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income \n(2)\n$\n—\n \n$\n140\n \n$\n—\n \nIncome (expense) recognized on cash flow hedges\n$\n—\n \n$\n140\n \n$\n—\n \n_____\n(1)\nSee Note 14 for gain or (loss) recognized for cash flow hedges in AOCI. \n(2)\nPre-tax\nThe following tables present the carrying amount and associated cumulative basis adjustment related to the application of hedge accounting that is included in the carrying amount of hedged assets and liabilities in fair value hedging relationships.\n2024\n2023\nHedged Items Currently Designated\nHedged Items Currently Designated\nCarrying Amount of Assets/(Liabilities)\nHedge Accounting Basis Adjustment\nCarrying Amount of Assets/(Liabilities)\nHedge Accounting Basis Adjustment\n(In millions)\n(In millions)\nDebt securities available for sale\n(1)(2)\n$\n3,304\n \n$\n(\n22\n)\n$\n1,653\n \n$\n5\n \nLong-term borrowings\n(\n3,058\n)\n91\n \n(\n1,286\n)\n112\n \n_____\n(1)   At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company designated interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of debt securities available for sale under the portfolio layer method under which the Company designated $\n750\n million and $\n1.0\n billion, respectively, as the hedged amount from a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets with a carrying amount of $\n1.8\n billion and $\n1.3\n billion, respectively.\n(2)    Carrying amount represents amortized cost.\nAdditionally, at December 31, 2023, the Company had fair value hedges on time deposits with a carrying amount of $\n252\n million and a hedge accounting basis adjustment of \nzero\n.\n \n \nDERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order \n151\nTable of Contents\n \nto reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital markets income) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as appropriate.\nRegions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Regions had $\n117\n million and $\n124\n million, respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair value based on management's election. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Regions had $\n308\n million and $\n267\n million, respectively, in total notional amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in mortgage income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial mortgage loans are included in capital markets income. \nRegions elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any changes to fair value recorded in mortgage income. Concurrent with the election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions uses various derivative instruments in the form of forward rate commitments, futures contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair value of its residential MSRs in its consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total notional amount related to these contracts was $\n3.4\n billion and $\n3.3\n billion, respectively.\nThe following table presents the location and amount of gain or (loss) recognized in income on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in the consolidated statements of income for the periods presented below:\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nCapital markets income:\nInterest rate swaps\n$\n29\n \n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n108\n \nInterest rate options\n52\n \n42\n \n23\n \nInterest rate futures and forward commitments\n23\n \n13\n \n10\n \nOther contracts\n23\n \n11\n \n11\n \nTotal capital markets income\n127\n \n49\n \n152\n \nMortgage income:\nInterest rate swaps\n(\n44\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n118\n)\nInterest rate options\n(\n4\n)\n1\n \n(\n14\n)\nInterest rate futures and forward commitments\n8\n \n(\n10\n)\n(\n4\n)\nTotal mortgage income\n(\n40\n)\n(\n23\n)\n(\n136\n)\n$\n87\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n16\n \nCREDIT DERIVATIVES\nRegions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of customers. Swap participations, whereby Regions has purchased credit protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2025 and 2030. Swap participations, whereby Regions has sold credit protection have maturities between 2025 and 2035. For contracts where Regions sold credit protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management practices of unfunded commitments.\nRegions’ maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $\n320\n million. This scenario occurs if variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit protection, recourse to collateral associated with the original swap transaction is available to offset some or all of Regions’ obligation.\n152\nTable of Contents\n \nCONTINGENT FEATURES\nCertain of Regions’ derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit-related provisions regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to terminate the contracts in the event that Regions’ and/or Regions Bank’s credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on December 31, 2024 and 2023, were $\n47\n million and $\n29\n million, respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of $\n34\n million and $\n32\n million, respectively, in the normal course of business.\nNOTE 21. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \nSee Note 1 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements. Marketable equity securities and debt securities available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3 valuation based on management’s conclusion regarding the observability of inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if they occur at the beginning of a reporting period.\nThe following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31:\n \n2024\n2023\n \nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3 \n(1)\nTotal\nEstimated Fair Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3 \n(1)\nTotal\nEstimated Fair Value\n \n(In millions)\nRecurring fair value measurements\nDebt securities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasury securities\n$\n2,003\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,003\n \n$\n1,223\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,223\n \nFederal agency securities\n—\n \n444\n \n—\n \n444\n \n—\n \n1,043\n \n—\n \n1,043\n \nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \nMortgage-backed securities:\nResidential agency\n—\n \n18,945\n \n—\n \n18,945\n \n—\n \n17,372\n \n—\n \n17,372\n \nCommercial agency\n—\n \n4,090\n \n—\n \n4,090\n \n—\n \n7,307\n \n—\n \n7,307\n \nCommercial non-agency\n—\n \n82\n \n—\n \n82\n \n—\n \n83\n \n—\n \n83\n \nCorporate and other debt securities\n—\n \n655\n \n3\n \n658\n \n—\n \n1,073\n \n1\n \n1,074\n \nTotal debt securities available for sale\n$\n2,003\n \n$\n24,218\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n26,224\n \n$\n1,223\n \n$\n26,880\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n28,104\n \nLoans held for sale\n$\n—\n \n$\n234\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n234\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n201\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n201\n \nMarketable equity securities in other earning assets\n$\n819\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n819\n \n$\n813\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n813\n \nResidential mortgage servicing rights\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,007\n \n$\n1,007\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n906\n \n$\n906\n \nCommercial mortgage servicing rights through non-DUS agency programs\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n97\n \n$\n97\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n81\n \n$\n81\n \nDerivative assets \n(2)\n:\nInterest rate swaps\n$\n—\n \n$\n1,634\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,634\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,813\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,813\n \nInterest rate options\n—\n \n30\n \n5\n \n35\n \n—\n \n83\n \n4\n \n87\n \nInterest rate futures and forward commitments\n—\n \n8\n \n—\n \n8\n \n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \n7\n \nOther contracts\n13\n \n126\n \n—\n \n139\n \n—\n \n198\n \n—\n \n198\n \nTotal derivative assets\n$\n13\n \n$\n1,798\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n1,816\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,101\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n2,105\n \nDerivative liabilities \n(2)\n:\nInterest rate swaps\n$\n—\n \n$\n2,411\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,411\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,419\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,419\n \nInterest rate options\n—\n \n30\n \n—\n \n30\n \n—\n \n70\n \n—\n \n70\n \nInterest rate futures and forward commitments\n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n12\n \n—\n \n12\n \nOther contracts\n3\n \n103\n \n—\n \n106\n \n—\n \n189\n \n1\n \n190\n \nTotal derivative liabilities\n$\n3\n \n$\n2,548\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,551\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,690\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2,691\n \nSecurities sold, but not yet purchased\n$\n147\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n147\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n_________\n(1)\nAll following disclosures related to Level 3 recurring assets do not include those deemed to be immaterial.\n(2)\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, variation margin collateral payments made or received for derivatives that are centrally cleared are legally characterized as settled. As such, these derivative assets and derivative liabilities and the related variation margin collateral are presented on a net basis on the balance sheet.\nAssets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions’ consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6 for a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of these MSRs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n153\nTable of Contents\n \nRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS\nResidential mortgage servicing rights\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of residential MSRs are CPR and OAS. This valuation requires generating cash flow projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs including servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 6 .\nCommercial mortgage servicing rights through non-DUS agency programs\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of commercial MSRs are CPR and the discount rate. This valuation requires generating cash flow projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash flows at a risk-adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and changes in the discount rate are based on a variety of underlying inputs including servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 6 .\nThe following tables present detailed information regarding material assets and liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The tables include the valuation techniques and the significant unobservable inputs utilized. The range of each significant unobservable input as well as the weighted-average within the range utilized at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are included.

This election allows for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. Fair values of residential first mortgage loans held for sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets where available and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for securitization activities that include servicing values and market conditions, and are recorded in loans held for sale. At December 31, 2024, the aggregate fair value of these loans totaled $\n222\n million compared to aggregate unpaid principal of $\n219\n million. At December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of these loans totaled $\n184\n million compared to aggregate unpaid principal of $\n177\n million.\nInterest income on residential first mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale. Net gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of residential first mortgage loans held for sale, which were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income during the years ended 2024 and 2023, were immaterial. These changes in fair value are mostly offset by economic hedging activities. An immaterial portion of these amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk.\n154\nTable of Contents\n \nNON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nItems measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include\n \nloans held for sale for which the fair value option has not been elected, foreclosed property and other real estate and equity investments without a readily determinable fair value; all of which may be considered either Level 2 or Level 3 valuation measurements. Non-recurring fair value adjustments related to loans held for sale, foreclosed property and other real estate are typically a result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting during the period. Non-recurring fair value adjustments related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values are the result of impairments or price changes from observable transactions. The balances of each of these assets, as well as the related fair value adjustments during the periods, were immaterial at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values, as well as the level within the fair value hierarchy, of the Company’s financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 are as follows: \n \n2024\n \nCarrying\nAmount\nEstimated\nFair\nValue\n(1)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\n \n(In millions)\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n10,712\n \n$\n10,712\n \n$\n10,712\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nDebt securities held to maturity\n4,427\n \n4,226\n \n—\n \n4,226\n \n—\n \nDebt securities available for sale\n26,224\n \n26,224\n \n2,003\n \n24,218\n \n3\n \nLoans held for sale\n594\n \n594\n \n—\n \n594\n \n—\n \nLoans (excluding leases), net of unearned income and allowance for loan losses\n(2)(3)\n93,424\n \n89,907\n \n—\n \n—\n \n89,907\n \nOther earning assets\n1,616\n \n1,616\n \n819\n \n797\n \n—\n \nDerivative assets\n1,816\n \n1,816\n \n13\n \n1,798\n \n5\n \nFinancial liabilities:\nDerivative liabilities\n2,551\n \n2,551\n \n3\n \n2,548\n \n—\n \nDeposits with no stated maturity\n(4)\n111,883\n \n111,883\n \n—\n \n111,883\n \n—\n \nTime deposits\n(4)\n15,720\n \n15,694\n \n—\n \n15,694\n \n—\n \nShort-term borrowings\n500\n \n500\n \n—\n \n500\n \n—\n \nLong-term borrowings\n5,993\n \n6,059\n \n—\n \n6,058\n \n1\n \nLoan commitments and letters of credit\n149\n \n149\n \n—\n \n—\n \n149\n \n_________\n(1)\nEstimated fair values are consistent with an exit price concept.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION \nEach of Regions’ reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves specific needs of Regions’ customers based on the products and services provided. The Company has \nthree\n reportable segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder in Other. The segments are based on the manner in which the CODM reviews the Company's performance. The Company's CODM is the CEO, President and Chair of the Board. As a part of the CODM review, pre-tax income is utilized to allocate resources amongst segments. \nThe application and development of management reporting methodologies is a dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be periodically revised and the prior periods updated to reflect these enhancements. Accordingly, the prior periods were updated to reflect these enhancements. \nThe Corporate Bank segment represents the Company’s commercial banking functions including commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and investor real estate lending. This segment also includes equipment lease financing, as well as capital markets activities, which include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication and placement, foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. Corporate Bank customers include corporate, middle market, and commercial real estate developers and investors. Corresponding deposit products related to these types of customers are also included in this segment.\nThe Consumer Bank segment represents the Company’s branch network, including consumer banking products and services related to residential first mortgages, home equity lines and loans, consumer credit cards and other consumer loans, as well as the corresponding deposit relationships. These services are also provided through the Company's digital channels and contact center.\nThe Wealth Management segment offers individuals, businesses, governmental institutions and non-profit entities a wide range of solutions to help protect, grow and transfer wealth. Offerings include credit related products, trust and investment management, asset management, retirement and savings solutions and estate planning. \nOther includes the Company’s Treasury function, the securities portfolio, wholesale funding activities, interest rate risk management activities and other corporate functions that are not related to a strategic business unit. Also within Other are certain reconciling items in order to translate the segment results that are based on management accounting practices into \n156\nTable of Contents\n \nconsolidated results. Management accounting practices utilized by Regions as the basis of presentation for segment results include the following:\n•\nNet interest income is presented utilizing an FTP approach, for which market-based funding charges/credits are assigned within the segments. By allocating a cost or a credit to each product based on the FTP framework, management is able to more effectively measure the net interest margin contribution of its assets/liabilities by segment. The summation of the interest income/expense and FTP charges/credits for each segment is its designated net interest income. \n•\nProvision for (benefit from) credit losses is allocated to each segment based on an estimated loss methodology. The difference between the consolidated provision for (benefit from) credit losses and the segments’ estimated loss is reflected in Other. \n•\nIncome tax expense (benefit) is calculated for the Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management based on a consistent federal and state statutory rate. Any difference between the Company’s consolidated income tax expense (benefit) and the segments’ calculated amounts is reflected in Other. \n•\nManagement reporting allocations of certain expenses are made in order to analyze the financial performance of the segments. These allocations consist of operational and overhead cost pools and are intended to represent the total costs to support a segment.\nThe following tables present financial information, including non-interest income disaggregated by major product category, for each reportable segment for the years ended December 31:\n2024\nCorporate Bank\nConsumer

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES \nCOMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nRegions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is subject to Regions’ normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management’s assessment of the creditworthiness of the customer. Credit risk is represented in unused commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit. \nCredit risk associated with these instruments as of December 31 is represented by the contractual amounts indicated in the following table:\n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nUnused commitments to extend credit\n$\n63,232\n \n$\n63,631\n \nStandby letters of credit\n2,096\n \n1,997\n \nCommercial letters of credit\n58\n \n78\n \nLiabilities associated with standby letters of credit\n33\n \n32\n \nAssets associated with standby letters of credit\n35\n \n34\n \nReserve for unfunded credit commitments\n116\n124\n \n159\nTable of Contents\n \nUnused commitments to extend credit\n—To accommodate the financial needs of its customers, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to consumers, businesses and other entities. These commitments include (among others) credit card and other revolving credit agreements, term loan commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Many of these loan commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements.\nStandby letters of credit\n—Standby letters of credit are also issued to customers which commit Regions to make payments on behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur. Regions has recourse against the customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby letter of credit. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and as such, the instruments are collateralized when necessary. Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of credit expire without being funded. The contractual amount of standby letters of credit represents the maximum potential amount of future payments Regions could be required to make and represents Regions’ maximum credit risk.\nCommercial letters of credit\n—Commercial letters of credit are issued to facilitate foreign or domestic trade transactions for customers. As a general rule, drafts will be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in transit.\nLEGAL CONTINGENCIES\nRegions and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to actual or threatened legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation matters range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits and can involve claims for substantial or indeterminate alleged damages or for injunctive or other relief. Regulatory investigations and enforcement matters may involve formal or informal proceedings and other inquiries initiated by various governmental agencies, law enforcement authorities, and self-regulatory organizations, and can result in fines, penalties, restitution, changes to Regions’ business practices, and other related costs, including reputational damage. At any given time, these legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, or investigation, and may relate to a variety of topics, including common law tort and contract claims, as well as statutory consumer protection-related claims, among others.\nAssessment of exposure that could result from legal proceedings is complex because these proceedings often involve inherently unpredictable factors, including, but not limited to, the following: whether the proceeding is in early stages; whether damages or the amount of potential fines, penalties, and restitution are unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery or other investigation has begun or is not complete; whether material facts may be disputed or unsubstantiated; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and whether the matter involves class allegations. As a result of these complexities, Regions may be unable to develop an estimate or range of loss.\nRegions evaluates legal proceedings based on information currently available, including advice of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Additionally, when it is practicable and reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of established accruals, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies. Regions currently estimates that the aggregate amount of reasonably possible losses that it may experience, in excess of what has been accrued, is immaterial. While the final outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the outcomes of pending and threatened matters will not have a material effect on Regions’ business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a whole.\nAs available information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as well as the estimates themselves, will be adjusted accordingly. Regions’ estimates are subject to significant judgment and uncertainties, and the matters underlying the estimates will change from time to time. In the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that an adverse outcome in any such matter could be material to Regions’ business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a whole for any particular reporting period of occurrence.\nSome of Regions’ exposure with respect to loss contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. However, in determining the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds are recorded in the period the recovery is received.\nGUARANTEES \nFANNIE MAE LOSS SHARE GUARANTEE \nRegions sells commercial loans to Fannie Mae through the DUS lending program and through other platforms. The DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third of the principal balance for the majority of the commercial servicing portfolio. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately $\n7.0\n billion and $\n6.2\n billion, \n160\nTable of Contents\n \nrespectively. Regions has additional loans sold to Fannie Mae outside of the DUS program that are also subject to a loss share guarantee and at December 31, 2024 and 2023, these serviced loans totaled approximately $\n665\n million and $\n653\n million, respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability related to all loans subject to a loss share guarantee was approximately $\n2.4\n billion and $\n2.3\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it services for Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable contingent liability is not representative of the actual loss the Company would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the associated loss share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets was immaterial at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 1 for additional information.\nVISA INDEMNIFICATION\nAs a member of the Visa USA network, Regions, along with other members, indemnified Visa USA against litigation. On October 3, 2007, Visa USA was restructured and acquired several Visa affiliates. In conjunction with this restructuring, Regions' indemnification of Visa USA was modified to cover specific litigation (“covered litigation”).\nA portion of Visa's proceeds from its IPO was put into escrow to fund the covered litigation. To the extent that the amount available under the escrow arrangement, or subsequent fundings of the escrow account resulting from reductions in the class B share conversion ratio, is insufficient to fully resolve the covered litigation, Visa will enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa USA's members for any excess amount. At this time, Regions has concluded that it is not probable that covered litigation exposure will exceed the class B share value.\nNOTE 24.
