    "item1": "Item 1. Busines\ns Description\n \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of manufacturing, services and retailing activities. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n\nBerkshire’s operating subsidiaries are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Berkshire’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations and Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations participate in and are ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses.\n\n\nBerkshire’s senior corporate management is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire’s Board of Directors is responsible for selecting an appropriate successor to the Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to ethics and compliance with government laws and regulations and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of its employees.\n \n\n\nHuman capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire’s businesses. Berkshire and its operating subsidiaries employed approximately 392,400 people worldwide at the end of 2024, of which approximately 80% were in the United States (“U.S.”) and 20% were represented by unions. Employees engage in a wide variety of occupations. Consistent with Berkshire’s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire’s operating subsidiaries each establish specific policies and practices concerning the attraction and retention of personnel within their organizations. Given the wide variations in the nature and size of business activities, specific policies and practices vary among Berkshire’s operating subsidiaries. Policies and practices commonly address, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment and minimizing or eliminating workplace injuries; offering competitive compensation, which includes various health insurance and retirement benefits, as well as incentives to recognize and reward performance; wellness programs; training, learning and career advancement opportunities; and hiring practices intended to identify qualified candidates. Berkshire’s combined U.S. workforce data, based on U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines, is available on its website \n(https://www.berkshirehathaway.com\n), under sustainability.\n\n\nInsurance Businesses\n \n\n\nBerkshire’s insurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based insurance subsidiaries. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks as well as life and health risks worldwide. Berkshire’s insurance businesses employed approximately 41,500 people at the end of 2024. For purposes of this discussion, entities that provide insurance or reinsurance are referred to as insurers.\n \n\n\nIn direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from people or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the insurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities.\n \n\n\nInsurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions.\n \n\n\nInsurers based in the U.S. are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of state regulation is to monitor financial solvency of insurers and otherwise protect policyholder interests. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities and have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business. States regulate the payment of shareholder dividends by insurance companies and other transactions with affiliates.\n \n\n\nK-\n1\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInsurers that market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and/or premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts.\n \n\n\nThe insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. In addition, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs dealing with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these solvency and soundness related matters, and the laws and regulations implemented in individual states may differ from those adopted by the NAIC.\n \n\n\nInternational insurance regulators, through the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”), have been developing advisory standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles (“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The Insurance Core Principles and ComFrame cover a wide range of topics, including group-wide supervision by regulators, corporate governance, risk management, capital adequacy and other macroprudential issues. As part of ComFrame, the IAIS adopted an international capital standard (“ICS”) for internationally active insurance groups in December 2024.\n \n\n\nWhile the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, U.S. state insurance departments and the NAIC are implementing various group supervision regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. U.S. state regulators have formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic and international insurance regulators. U.S. state regulators require insurance groups to file an annual report and an Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead supervisor. The NAIC also adopted a group capital calculation (“GCC”) tool for large insurance groups. The NAIC’s GCC is a tool designed to help the lead supervisor understand the capital adequacy across an insurance group. The NAIC is also developing further tools, including various liquidity assessments, that will likely be imposed on insurance groups in the future. While the ICS is based on a consolidation approach, the GCC is based on an aggregation approach called the Aggregation Method. In December 2024, the IAIS announced that the Aggregation Method has been deemed to be comparable to the ICS.\n \n\n\nThe Nebraska Department of Insurance (“Nebraska DOI”) acts as the lead supervisor for Berkshire’s insurance group and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. The Nebraska DOI adopted the GCC tool, and Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries are required to submit an annual GCC to it.\n \n\n\nBerkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their competitors. The combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $310 billion at December 31, 2024. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability.\n \n\n\nThe Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established a Terrorism Insurance Program (“Program”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury to provide federal reinsurance of certified terrorism losses incurred by U.S. commercial property and casualty insurers. The Program extends to December 31, 2027 through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019. Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. The Department of the Treasury is responsible for certifying acts of terrorism under TRIA. Federal reinsurance under TRIA may apply if the industry insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million.\n \n\n\nTo be eligible for reinsurance under TRIA, insurers must make insurance coverage available for acts of terrorism by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for the coverage and the federal share of insured losses resulting from an act of terrorism. TRIA excludes certain forms of direct insurance, such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines. Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses.\n \n\n\nIn the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of the insurers group deductible. Under TRIA, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible for Berkshire’s insurance group is expected to be approximately $2.6 billion in 2025. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal reinsurance coverage for each TRIA year.\n \n\n\nK-\n2\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe extent of insurance regulation varies widely among the countries where Berkshire’s non-U.S. operations conduct business. Each country imposes licensing, solvency, risk management and financial reporting requirements, although the type and extent of the requirements may differ substantially by jurisdiction.\n\n\nSignificant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local non-U.S. regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators maintain close relationships with subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.\n\n\nBerkshire’s non-U.S. insurance operations are conducted through subsidiaries and branches of subsidiaries. Non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries are primarily located in Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Australia and South Africa, and branches are also maintained in several other countries. Most of these foreign jurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements involve discretionary licensing procedures, risk management and governance requirements, local retention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection programs. Berkshire’s international insurance companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws. There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions, and the potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened due to industry and economic developments.\n \n\n\nBerkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”), based in New York, New York, was acquired by Berkshire on October 19, 2022. Alleghany’s operating subsidiaries include property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses. Alleghany’s primary insurance businesses are included in the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and its reinsurance businesses are included in the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.\n \n\n\nExcept for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products, which generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over long time periods (creating “float,” see Investments section), Berkshire expects to achieve an underwriting profit over time and that its managers will reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less incurred insurance losses and benefits, loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments. Additional information related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows.\n \n\n\nGEICO\n—GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries include Government Employees Insurance Company and several other insurance entities. The GEICO insurance subsidiaries’ principal business is the sale of private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO subsidiaries also sell insurance for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial automobile fleets. Marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO also operates an insurance agency that offers insurance written by third parties for individuals desiring insurance coverages that are not sold by GEICO insurance subsidiaries, such as homeowners, renters, condominium, life and identity protection insurance.\n \n\n\nGEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer and with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Progressive, Allstate and USAA. According to the A.M. Best data for 2023 published in 2024, the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share of approximately 62.3% based on written premiums, with GEICO’s market share being the third largest at approximately 12.3%.\n\n\nSeasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other events and factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims.\n\n\nGEICO’s insurance policies are written on an admitted basis. State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance policies and rates. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. GEICO’s name and other trademarks are considered material assets and are protected through appropriate registrations.\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Primary Group\n—The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) is a collection of independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the U.S. Nearly 90% of BH Primary premiums written in 2024 were in the U.S., of which approximately 60% was written on an admitted basis, with the remainder written on a non-admitted basis. These various operations are discussed below.\n \n\n\nK-\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNational Indemnity Company (“NICO”), domiciled in Nebraska, and certain affiliates (“NICO Primary”) underwrite commercial automobile and general liability insurance on an admitted basis and on an excess and surplus lines basis. Insurance coverage is offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers.\n \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”) is a group of insurers offering workers’ compensation, commercial automobile and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has a national reach, with the ability to provide first-dollar and small-to-large deductible workers’ compensation coverage to employers nationwide. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in Omaha, Nebraska.\n \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”) offers commercial property and casualty, executive and professional, and various other insurance coverages through Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Company and several other Berkshire subsidiaries. BHSI writes primary and excess policies on an admitted and non-admitted basis in the U.S., and on a local or foreign non-admitted basis outside the U.S. BHSI is based in Boston, Massachusetts, and has regional offices in several other cities within the U.S. BHSI also maintains international offices and branches in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and across several countries in Asia and Europe. BHSI writes insurance policies through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as through managing general agents.\n \n\n\nAlleghany’s property and casualty insurance business is conducted in the U.S. on both an admitted and non-admitted basis through RSUI Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“RSUI”) and CapSpecialty, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“CapSpecialty”). RSUI and CapSpecialty primarily write specialty insurance in the property, umbrella/excess liability, professional liability, directors’ and officers’ liability and general liability lines of business. Insurance is written through independent wholesale insurance brokers, retail agents and managing general agents.\n\n\nMedPro Group (“MedPro”) is a leading provider of healthcare liability (“HCL”) insurance in the U.S. MedPro provides customized HCL insurance, as well as claims, patient safety and risk solutions to physicians, surgeons, dentists and other healthcare professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities. Additionally, MedPro provides HCL insurance solutions to international markets through other Berkshire insurance affiliates, offers professional liability insurance to other non-healthcare professionals, and provides specialized accident and health insurance solutions to colleges and other customers through its subsidiaries and other Berkshire subsidiaries. MedPro is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”) writes medical professional liability insurance policies in New York State through brokers and on a direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. MLMIC is based in Albany, New York.\n\n\nU.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”) includes a group of five specialty insurers that underwrite commercial, professional and personal lines of insurance on an admitted basis, as well as on an excess and surplus lines basis. USLI markets policies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USLI also underwrites and markets a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania. The GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) consist of five insurance companies that provide a comprehensive suite of commercial insurance solutions to over 200,000 small-to-medium sized businesses. These insurance products are accessible through independent agents and wholesale brokers. GUARD is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.\n \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance Company and its affiliates (“BH Direct”) offer commercial insurance products (including workers’ compensation, property, auto, general and professional liability) to small business customers. BH Direct’s products are primarily sold through two internet-based distribution platforms, biBERK.com and Threeinsurance.com. BH Direct writes policies on an admitted basis and is based in Stamford, Connecticut.\n \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group\n—Berkshire’s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG conducts business activities in 24 countries. Reinsurance business is written through NICO and affiliates (“NICO Group”), General Re Corporation and its subsidiaries (“General Re Group”) and Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and its affiliates (“TransRe Group”). U.S. underwriting operations of the NICO Group and General Re Group are based in Stamford, Connecticut while the TransRe Group is based in New York, New York.\n\n\nReinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by a direct insurer or reinsurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess-of-loss. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess-of-loss (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or “retention.” Both quota-share and excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification.\n \n\n\nK-\n4\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions.\n\n\nProperty/casualty\n \n\n\nThe NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for very large or unusual risks. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group’s annual reinsurance premium derived from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (“IAG”). This quota-share agreement expires December 31, 2029. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific countries.\n\n\nThe General Re Group is a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-share and excess-of-loss basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a facultative basis. The General Re Group conducts business in North America, primarily marketed on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC also conducts operations in North America through numerous branch offices in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\nIn North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and professional liability coverages. These companies offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive customers and their business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators.\n \n\n\nThe General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is primarily written on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG, based in Cologne, Germany, and subsidiaries and branches in numerous other countries, as well as through brokers by Faraday Corporate Capital Limited, which participates in the Lloyd’s of London market through Syndicate 435.\n\n\nThe TransRe Group provides quota-share and excess-of-loss reinsurance across various property and casualty lines of business. Contracts are written on both a treaty and facultative basis to insurance companies in the U.S. and in foreign markets through subsidiaries and branches in numerous countries. Business is written primarily through brokers, and to a lesser extent on a direct basis.\n\n\nLife/health\n \n\n\nThe General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In 2024, net premiums written were primarily in the Asia-Pacific, U.S. and Western Europe regions. The General Re Group underwrites life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care risks on a direct basis.\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and its affiliates write reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and reinsured certain guaranteed minimum death, income and similar risks on closed-blocks of variable annuity risks, which are in run-off.\n\n\nRetroactive reinsurance\n \n\n\nRetroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies for adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverage under such contracts is provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts are normally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts.\n\n\nThe concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which is reflected through investment results in future periods.\n\n\nK-\n5\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeriodic payment annuity\n \n\n\nBHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures annuity-like obligations. Under these policies, BHLN receives upfront consideration and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These policies generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation claims of other insurers, known as structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money is an important factor in establishing annuity premiums and ultimate payments are expected to exceed premiums received, producing underwriting losses. BHLN wrote no new policies in 2023 and 2024 in response to changing economic and market conditions.\n\n\nInvestments of insurance businesses\n—Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets. Investment portfolios are managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer and, to a lesser extent, by two corporate investment managers. Investments include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are unusually concentrated in relatively few companies, as well as in short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. Generally, there are no target allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry.\n \n\n\nInvested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance businesses (“float”). Float represents the approximate net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities that are held for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities (excluding the effects of discount rate changes that are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income), unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on assumed retroactive reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $129 billion at the end of 2019 to approximately $171 billion at the end of 2024. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting earnings (or loss) as a percentage of average float.\n\n\nBurlington Northern Santa Fe\n \n\n\nBurlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 36,500 employees at the end of 2024, of whom approximately 32,000 were members of a labor union.\n \n\n\nIn serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and certain ports of the U.S., BNSF Railway transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels.\n \n\n\nBNSF Railway’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and certain ports in the western and southern U.S. as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. Freight revenues are classified into the following categories: consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. The volumes shipped and rates charged are affected by competition from other freight carriers within the transportation industry, and changes in the underlying supply and demand for such products.\n \n\n\nRegulatory Matters\n \n\n\nBNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business.\n \n\n\nThe DOT, OSHA and EPA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety, health and environmental aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some health, safety and environmental aspects of rail operations in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.\n\n\nK-\n6\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n \n\n\nBNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulations covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.\n \n\n\nMany of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal statutes (in particular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations.\n \n\n\nConsumption of diesel fuel by locomotives accounted for approximately 80% of BNSF Railway’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions in its baseline year of 2018. BNSF management has committed to a broad sustainability model, applying science-based approaches, that is anticipated to result in a 30% reduction in BNSF Railway’s GHG emissions by 2030 from its baseline year of 2018. BNSF Railway intends to continue improvements in fuel efficiency and increased utilization of renewable diesel fuel. Long-term solutions, such as battery-electric and hydrogen locomotives, are also being evaluated and field-tested.\n\n\nCompetition\n \n\n\nThe business environment in which BNSF Railway operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity.\n \n\n\nAs railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the U.S. is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF Railway.\n \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) is a holding company headquartered in Iowa with investments in a diversified portfolio of locally managed and operated businesses, principally within the energy industry. BHE’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of four regulated U.S. utility companies (collectively, “U.S. utilities”) serving approximately 5.3 million retail customers and five U.S. interstate natural gas pipeline companies with approximately 21,000 miles of operated pipeline having a design capacity of approximately 21.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. Other energy businesses include electric transmission and distribution operations in Great Britain and Canada, a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments, and a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility. BHE also has an investment in a residential real estate brokerage firm in the U.S. and is a franchisor to a large network of residential real estate brokerages in the U.S. BHE employs approximately 24,000 people in connection with its various operations.\n \n\n\nEnergy businesses\n\n\nBHE’s U.S. utilities include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy, Inc.’s (“NV Energy”) two regulated utility subsidiaries, Nevada Power Company (“Nevada Power”) and Sierra Pacific Power Company (“Sierra Pacific”).\n \n\n\nPacifiCorp is a regulated electric utility company headquartered in Oregon, serving electric customers in portions of Utah, Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho and California. The combined service territory’s diverse regional economy ranges from rural, agricultural and mining areas to urban, manufacturing and government service centers. No single segment of the economy dominates the combined service territory, which helps mitigate PacifiCorp’s exposure to economic fluctuations. In addition to retail sales, PacifiCorp buys and sells electricity on a wholesale basis.\n\n\nK-\n7\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMEC is a regulated electric and natural gas utility company headquartered in Iowa, serving electric and natural gas customers primarily in Iowa and also in portions of Illinois, South Dakota and Nebraska. MEC’s diverse retail customer base operates in the electronic data storage, agricultural, manufacturing and government service centers industries. In addition to retail sales and natural gas transportation, MEC sells electricity and natural gas on a wholesale basis.\n \n\n\nNevada Power serves retail electric customers in southern Nevada and Sierra Pacific serves retail electric and natural gas customers in northern Nevada.

Additionally, BHE subsidiaries have invested approximately $7.3 billion to-date in wind projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments.\n\n\nK-\n8\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRegulatory Matters\n \n\n\nThe U.S. utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.6 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station.\n \n\n\nWith certain limited exceptions, the U.S. utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including the opportunity to earn a fair and reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of U.S. utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission-only and distribution-only services.\n \n\n\nNorthern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, the British electricity regulatory body. The current electricity distribution price control runs from April 1, 2023 through March 31, 2028.\n\n\nAltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system (“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning.\n \n\n\nThe natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service; (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities; and (c) the construction and operation of liquefied natural gas export/import facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities.\n \n\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n \n\n\nBHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions.\n\n\nThe Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. The implementation of these laws and regulations may impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities, including requiring reductions in emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers.\n \n\n\nK-\n9\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius and reaching a global peak of GHG emissions as soon as possible to achieve climate neutrality by mid-century; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will be more aggressive in reducing GHG emissions. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the U.S. agreed to reduce GHG emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2025. The Paris Agreement formally became effective on November 4, 2016; however, the U.S. completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 20, 2021, and the U.S. completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. New commitments to the Paris Agreement were announced in April 2021, with the U.S. pledging to cut its overall GHG emissions by 50% to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. In December 2024, President Biden released new commitments to reach a 61% to 66% reduction in emissions by 2035 from 2005 levels, which includes a 35% reduction in methane emissions. While in January 2025, President Trump ordered to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the outgoing Biden administration highlighted that the revised targets could be met without federal action. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce GHG emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy.\n\n\nIn April 2024, the EPA finalized new rules addressing GHG emissions for the power sector. The requirements are scheduled to take effect January 1, 2030. New natural gas-fueled combustion turbines are expected to utilize lower-emitting fuels and operate as highly efficient generation. Additionally, new baseload combustion turbines exceeding a 40% annual capacity factor must meet an emission limit equivalent to operating with carbon capture and sequestration beginning January 1, 2032. The EPA also identified carbon capture and sequestration as the technology basis for the emissions standards for coal units. Coal-fueled units that will operate after December 31, 2038, must meet emission limits equivalent to operating with carbon capture and sequestration beginning January 1, 2032. Other units are anticipated to co-fire with natural gas and retire prior to January 1, 2039, or convert to natural gas operations and meet emission limits corresponding to capacity factors. The EPA deferred action on standards for existing natural gas-fueled combustion turbines. The rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The incoming Trump administration is expected to ask the court to abate litigation while it reevaluates the rule. Because the rule is final and in effect, additional rulemaking would be required to rescind and potentially replace the emissions standards.\n\n\nIn November 2021, the EPA proposed rules that would reduce methane emissions from both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry. The proposals would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and natural gas sources and would require states to reduce methane emissions from existing sources nationwide. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal in November 2022 to further strengthen emission requirements. The rule was finalized in December 2023. Affected sources may have up to five years from the rule’s effective date to comply with requirements identified in state implementation plans. The rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Trump administration is expected to ask the court to abate litigation while it reevaluates the rule. Because the rule is final and in effect, additional rulemaking would be required to rescind and potentially replace the emissions standards.\n\n\nBHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers and on actions to mitigate its GHG emissions. BHE’s primary source of GHG emissions is the generation of electricity from its power plants that are fueled by coal or natural gas. In managing its electricity generation, BHE’s subsidiaries work with their regulators to protect the energy and economic needs of customers by considering costs, reliability and sources of electric generation. Over the years, BHE has invested heavily in owned renewable generation and storage, with cumulative investments of $35.4 billion through December 31, 2024. Additionally, BHE has ceased coal operations at 18 generation units. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, BHE has reduced its annual GHG emissions by more than 38% as compared to 2005 levels. To the extent it is beneficial for customers and consistent with regulatory provisions, BHE plans to continue investing in renewable and other low-carbon generation and storage in the future and to cease coal operations at additional coal generation units in a reliable and cost-effective manner, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.\n \n\n\nK-\n10\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNon-Energy Businesses\n \n\n\nHomeServices of America, Inc.

The majority of PCC’s sales are from customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual terms may provide for termination by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules.\n\n\nK-\n11\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLong-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. Continued growth in revenues and earnings will be predicated on PCC’s ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace products, as well as improvements in the industry supply chains, which are currently constraining commercial aircraft production at OEMs.\n\n\nPCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide its customers with advantages, such as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. Nevertheless, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages.\n\n\nSeveral raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum, hafnium and molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation.\n \n\n\nPCC is subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, waste management, toxic materials use reduction and environmental cleanup. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, particularly related to air and water quality and climate change, including reporting of GHG emissions. As a result, it is also reasonably likely that PCC will be regularly required to make additional expenditures, including capital expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters.\n\n\nLubrizol\n \n\n\nThe Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), headquartered in Wickliffe, Ohio, is a specialty chemical and performance materials company that manufactures products and supplies technologies for the global transportation, industrial and consumer markets.

Clayton sells off-site built homes through independent and company-owned home centers, realtors and subdivision channels.

Historically, the availability and pricing of these and other inputs has been volatile resulting in input shortages.\n\n\nClayton’s off-site home building business is impacted by changes in U.S. home mortgage interest rates. While interest rates slightly declined in the latter part of 2024, interest rates significantly increased during 2022 and 2023, slowing demand for new home construction, which was partially mitigated by low supplies of pre-existing homes for sale.\n \n\n\nClayton’s home building business regularly makes capital and non-capital expenditures with respect to compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, primarily related to erosion control, permitting and stormwater protection for site-built home subdivisions. The financing business originates and services loans which are federally regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, various state regulatory agencies and reviewed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Government National Mortgage Association and government-sponsored enterprises.\n \n\n\nK-\n15\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nShaw\n \n\n\nShaw Industries Group, Inc.

Given the retail price transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers.\n \n\n\nBHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA.\n \n\n\nIndividual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. States generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with “good cause” under the applicable state franchise law.\n \n\n\nBHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and insurance personnel.\n \n\n\nHome furnishings retailing\n \n\n\nThe home furnishings businesses consist of Nebraska Furniture Mart Inc.
