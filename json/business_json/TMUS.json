We also provide wholesale wireless services to various partners, who then offer the services for sale to their customers. Our most significant expenses relate to operating and expanding our network, providing a full range of devices, acquiring and retaining high-quality customers and compensating employees. We provide services, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile and Mint Mobile, through our T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile owned and operated retail stores, as well as through our websites (www.t-mobile.com, www.metrobyt-mobile.com and www.mintmobile.com), T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile and Mint Mobile apps, customer care channels and through national retailers. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third-party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites. The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K. See \nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n for additional information.\nServices and Products\nWe provide wireless communications services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer for sale to customers a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets, home broadband routers and other mobile communication devices that are manufactured by various suppliers. \n6\nTable of Contents\nOur most popular service plan offering is Go5G Plus, which includes unlimited talk, text and data on our network, 5G access at no extra cost, scam protection features, access to the same device offers as new customers and more. We also offer an Essentials rate plan for customers who want the basics at a lower price point, specific rate plans to qualifying customers, including Military and Veterans, First Responder and 55+, as well as Go5G and Go5G Next plans to deliver a full suite of plans that provide customers the features that meet their lifestyle and daily needs.\nAt the time of device purchase, qualified customers can finance all or a portion of the individual device or accessory purchase price over an installment period, generally of 24 months, using an equipment installment plan (“EIP”). \nIn addition to our wireless communications services, we offer High Speed Internet, which includes a fixed wireless product that utilizes the excess capacity of our nationwide 5G network. Our fixed wireless product is available to tens of millions of domestic households where we currently have excess network capacity, providing, for some consumers, an alternative to traditional landline internet or broadband service providers and expanding access to and choice for some consumers. With our High Speed Internet plan, customers can access the internet without worrying about annual service contracts, data overages or hidden fees. \nWe also provide products and services that are complementary to our wireless communications services, including device protection, financial services and advertising.\nCustomers\nWe provide wireless communications services to a variety of customers needing connectivity, but focus primarily on two categories of customers: \n•\nPostpaid customers generally are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, High Speed Internet modems, mobile internet devices (including tablets and hotspots), wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices (including SyncUP and internet of things (“IoT”)). We serve consumers as well as business customers, who are provided services under the T-Mobile for Business brand.\n•\nPrepaid customers generally pay for wireless communications services in advance. We serve prepaid customers under the T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile brands.\nWe provide Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) customers access to our network. This access and the customer relationship are managed by wholesale partners, with whom we have commercial agreements permitting them to sell services utilizing our network. \nWe generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communications services to postpaid and prepaid customers. Our ability to attract and retain postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2024, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communications services by customer category were:\n•\n79% Postpaid customers;\n•\n16% Prepaid customers; and \n•\n5% Wholesale and other services.\nSubstantially all of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were earned in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nNetwork Strategy\nUtilizing our multilayer spectrum portfolio, our mission is to become “Famous for Network.” We have deployed low-band, mid-band and mmWave spectrum dedicated for 5G across our dense and broad network to create what we believe is America’s largest, fastest, most awarded and most advanced 5G network. \nWe believe our spectrum position and focus on technology leadership will continue to drive network differentiation. Our innovative Customer-Driven Coverage (“CDC”) approach to network investments, and leadership in deploying the latest network technologies including Massive Multiple-input/multiple-out (“Massive MIMO”), Voice over New Radio (“VoNR”), four-carrier and higher order aggregation, dynamic network slicing and the U.S.’s first broad deployment of 5G Advanced, are \n7\nTable of Contents\nenabled by our scaled nationwide 5G standalone network. We are also part of an alliance working to bring Radio Access Network (“RAN”) and AI innovation closer together to deliver transformational network experiences in the future.\nSpectrum Position\nWe provide wireless communications services utilizing low-band spectrum licenses covering our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum, mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”), Personal Communications Services (“PCS”) and 2.5 GHz spectrum, and mmWave spectrum.\n•\nWe controlled an average of 394 MHz of combined low- and mid-band spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2024. This spectrum is comprised of:\n•\nAn average of 41 MHz in the 600 MHz band;\n•\nAn average of 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band;\n•\nAn average of 14 MHz in the 800 MHz band;\n•\nAn average of 41 MHz in the 1700 MHz AWS band;\n•\nAn average of 66 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band;\n•\nAn average of 184 MHz in the 2.5 GHz band;\n•\nAn average of 11 MHz in the 3.45 GHz band; and\n•\nAn average of 27 MHz in the C-band.\n•\nWe controlled an average of 1,033 GHz of combined mmWave spectrum licenses.\n•\nIn September 2023, we entered into a License Purchase Agreement with Comcast Corporation and its affiliate, Comcast OTR1, LLC (together with Comcast Corporation, “Comcast”) pursuant to which we will acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band in exchange for total cash consideration of between $1.2 billion and $3.3 billion. On January 13, 2025, we and Comcast entered into an amendment to the License Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we will acquire additional spectrum. Subsequent to the amendment, the total cash consideration for the transaction is between $1.2 billion and $3.4 billion. See \nNote \n7\n – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets\n of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\n•\nWe plan to evaluate future spectrum purchases in future auctions and secondary market opportunities to further augment or refine our current spectrum position.\n•\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had equipment deployed on approximately 82,000 macro cell sites and 52,000 small cell/distributed antenna system sites across our network. \nCompetition\nThe wireless communications services industry remains competitive. We are the second largest provider of wireless communications services in the U.S. as measured by our total postpaid and prepaid customers. Our wireless communications services competitors include other carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”), and DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”) as it continues to grow its network. In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller and regional providers, including Comcast Corporation, Charter Communications, Inc., Cox Communications, Inc., and Altice USA, Inc., many of which offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies. In addition to our wireless communications services, our High Speed Internet service competes against other broadband providers, including traditional wireline solutions, such as Cable, DSL and Fiber broadband providers, and fixed wireless solutions, including AT&T and Verizon’s fixed wireless products, and Satellite Internet providers. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services and broadband industries include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies and regulatory changes. Some of our competitors have shown a willingness to use discounted pricing or offer bundled services as a potential source of differentiation. \nHuman Capital\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 70,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.\n8\nTable of Contents\nAttraction and Retention\nWe employ a highly skilled workforce within a broad range of functions. Substantially all of our employees are located throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico, to serve our nationwide network and retail operations. Our headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington, and Overland Park, Kansas.\nWe attract and retain our workforce through a dynamic and inclusive culture and by providing a comprehensive set of benefits, including:\n•\nCompetitive medical, dental and vision benefits;\n•\nFamily-building benefits designed to meet the diverse needs of our employees, including IVF and IUI, adoption and surrogacy benefits;\n•\nAnnual stock grants to all full-time and part-time employees and a discounted Employee Stock Purchase Program;\n•\nA 401(k) Savings Plan;\n•\nNationwide minimum pay of at least $20 per hour to all full-time and part-time employees;\n•\nLiveMagenta: a custom-branded program for employee engagement and well-being, including free access to life coaches, financial coaches and tools for healthy living;\n•\nAccess to personal health advocates offering independent guidance;\n•\nA generous paid time off program, including paid family leave;\n•\nTuition assistance for all full-time and part-time employees, including full tuition partnerships with multiple schools; and\n•\nA matching program for employee donations and volunteering.\nTraining and Development\nCareer growth and development is foundational to T-Mobile’s culture and success. We want to deliver the best experiences from the best teams, and one way we do that is by offering an array of development programs and resources to build diverse talent and empower our people to succeed through every step of their career. We put employees in the driver’s seat and give them access to mentoring, training, videos, books, job search and interview tips, and much more. \nBy strategically investing in the following three key areas of career development and learning, we are developing our talent now and for the future.\n•\nEvolve skills and careers – Learn every day, champion relentless improvement, develop critical skills, explore career possibilities, and build the desired career; \n•\nAdvance leadership expertise – Build critical leadership capabilities, enable leadership growth at all levels, and develop skills to lead in the future; and\n•\nChampion belonging and inclusion – Promote inclusive habits and behaviors and enhance belonging and connectedness.\nBelonging and Inclusion\nOur diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are focused on fostering a workplace that helps us better serve our customers and communities across the nation. We aim to create an environment where employees feel included, valued and empowered, contributing to a stronger, more connected business. T-Mobile has an inclusive hiring process that seeks diverse talent to be candidates for employment, but all of our hiring decisions continue to be based solely on merit.\nEmployee Resource Groups (ERGs)\nMany of our employees participate in one of six Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and their sub-groups, which are instrumental in promoting connection. Each of these groups is open to any and all employees, and there are 38 chapters nationwide that organize volunteer opportunities and local events. \n9\nTable of Contents\nOur ERGs include:\n•\nVeterans & Allies Network;\n•\nAccessibility Community at T-Mobile;\n•\nMulticultural Alliance;\n•\nAsia Pacific & Allies Network;\n•\nBlack Empowerment Network;\n•\nIndigenous Peoples Network;\n•\nEleva Network (focused on the Latino community and allies);\n•\nMultigenerational Network;\n•\nPride; and\n•\nWomen & Allies Network. \nThese groups offer immersive experiences, mentorship programs, networking opportunities, and community service projects. They are designed to help participants grow as professionals and community leaders\n.\nExternal Diversity Councils\nIn partnership with civil rights organizations, we had previously established two External Diversity and Inclusion Councils. These councils offered guidance for our efforts in areas like workforce recruitment, procurement, community investment, and corporate governance. The work with these external councils concluded as planned after a successful 5-year collaboration and the councils have been dissolved.\nSuppliers\nT-Mobile considers a broad range of suppliers, including those that are veteran-owned, disability-owned, woman-owned, minority-owned, and LGBT-owned, and we include small and large businesses of all kinds in our procurement processes. Purchases and contracts are awarded based on the best qualified and most competitive suppliers to enable T-Mobile’s success.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nEfficiencies and Reducing Our Carbon Footprint\nWe are actively working to identify efficiencies in our energy usage and reduce our environmental impact by:\n•\nPursuing a science-based net-zero emissions target for 2040, covering Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions;\n•\nInvesting in renewable energy, meeting our RE100 pledge since 2021, through initiatives such as Virtual Power Purchasing Agreements and clean energy projects producing over 3.4 million megawatt hours annually;\n•\nEnhancing energy efficiency in our facilities, including retail stores, data centers, and cell sites; and\n•\nPromoting a circular economy through a robust device reuse and recycling program.\nResponsible Sourcing\nWe believe our suppliers are a valuable extension of our business and corporate values. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines expectations around ethical business practices for our suppliers. We require our suppliers to operate in compliance with the laws, rules, regulations and ethical standards of the countries in which they operate or provide products or services. We expect our suppliers to share our commitment to ethical conduct and environmentally responsible business practices while they conduct business with or on behalf of us. Our Responsible Sourcing Policy further outlines T-Mobile’s expectations in this area. \nWe employ a third-party risk management (“TPRM”) process to screen for anti-corruption, global sanctions, human rights and environmental risks before engaging with a supplier. Our TPRM process also continuously monitors current suppliers for policy violations and risks.\n10\nTable of Contents\nRegulation\nThe FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911, 988 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, robocalling/robotexting, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, digital discrimination, consumer protection and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly.\nExcept for operations in certain unlicensed frequency bands, wireless communications services providers generally must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority both to revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the FCC retains the right to modify rules related to use of licensed spectrum, which could impact T-Mobile’s ability to provide services.\nAdditionally, Congress’s and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS and other wireless services, could significantly increase and intensify competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses or our competitive position in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings in the context of spectrum transactions or acquisitions. Most recently, for example, in September 2023, the FCC sought public comment on whether it should initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider changes to its mobile spectrum rules and policies. A change in these rules and policies could affect our access to additional spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers.\nCongress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees. Direct foreign ownership in the licensee of more than 20% is prohibited. Indirect foreign ownership of more than 25% through an entity controlling the licensee must be reviewed and approved by the FCC as not inconsistent with the public interest. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT.\nFor our Educational Broadband Service (“EBS”) licenses in the 2.5 GHz band, FCC rules previously limited eligibility to hold EBS licenses to accredited educational institutions and certain governmental, religious and nonprofit entities, while permitting those license holders to lease their licenses to commercial providers for non-educational purposes. Therefore, we have historically accessed EBS spectrum primarily through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial term equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. In April 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. The elimination of these restrictions allows current license holders to sell their licenses, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated. T-Mobile has started to acquire some of these EBS licenses, but we continue to lease spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time.\nWhile the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communications services providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, service mapping, protection of consumer information, zoning and land use. Notwithstanding this federal preemption, several states are considering or have passed laws or regulations \n11\nTable of Contents\nthat could potentially set prices, minimum performance standards and/or restrictions on service discontinuation that could impact our business in those states.\nFor example, following the FCC’s adoption of the 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom (“RIF”) Order reclassifying broadband internet access services as non-common carrier “information services,” a number of states sought to impose state-specific net neutrality, rate-setting, and privacy requirements on providers’ broadband services. The FCC’s RIF Order expressly preempted such state efforts, which were inconsistent with the FCC’s federal deregulatory approach at that time. In 2019, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local measures regulating broadband services. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC’s RIF Order and be preempted. In the meantime, the FCC sought to repeal the RIF Order through its adoption of the 2024 Open Internet Order, though the latter was struck down by a federal court of appeals in January 2025.\nWhile most states pursuing net neutrality legislation sought to codify the federal rules repealed by the RIF Order, there are differences in some states. For example, California has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation, while many others have passed privacy laws, and New York has passed a broadband rate-setting law. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements. Ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws, is critical to this effort. If not preempted or rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. A number of states also subject wireless service providers to registration requirements. State authority over wireless broadband services will likely remain unsettled unless resolved by the courts, the FCC or Congress.\nIn addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection matters and the elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are, to some extent, unknown, and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.\nAvailable Information\nThe SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically at www.sec.gov. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) are also publicly available free of charge on the investor relations section of our website at investor.t-mobile.com as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our corporate governance guidelines, director selection guideline, code of ethics for senior financial officers, code of business conduct, speak up policy, supplier code of conduct, and charters for the audit, compensation, nominating and corporate governance, and executive committees of our Board of Directors are also posted on the investor relations section of our website at investor.t-mobile.com. The information on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating T-Mobile. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. If we are unable to attract and retain customers, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be negatively affected.\nThe wireless communications services industry is highly competitive. As the industry reaches saturation, competition in all market segments, including prepaid, postpaid, enterprise and government customers will likely further intensify, putting pressure on pricing and/or margins for us and all our competitors. Our ability to attract and retain customers will depend on multiple factors, such as network quality and capacity, customer service excellence, effective marketing strategies, competitive pricing, compelling value propositions, and distribution and logistics capabilities. Additionally, targeted marketing approaches for diverse customer segments, coupled with continuous innovation in products and services, are essential for retaining and \n12\nTable of Contents\nexpanding our customer base. If we are unable to successfully differentiate our services from our competitors, it would adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow our business.\nWe have seen and expect to continue to see intense competition in all market segments from traditional Mobile Network Operators (“MNOs”), such as AT&T and Verizon, who have each invested heavily in spectrum, their wireless networks, and services and device promotions, and DISH, as it continues to build out its wireless network and roll out services. Numerous other regional MNOs and MVNOs offering wireless services may also compete with us in some markets, including cable providers, such as Comcast, Charter, Cox, and Altice, as they continue to diversify their offerings to include wireless services offered under MVNO agreements. As new products and services emerge, we may also be forced to compete against non-traditional competitors from outside of the wireless communications services industry, such as satellite providers, offering similar connectivity services using alternative technologies. \nIn the market for broadband services, traditional cable providers, AT&T, Verizon, and other players such as satellite and fiber providers, all compete for customers. To complement our fixed wireless service, we have agreed to enter into joint venture agreements aimed at establishing a robust fiber wireline network in certain geographic regions that we believe will complement our fixed wireless services in those areas. However, these partnerships also involve inherent risks. See \n“Any acquisition, divestiture, investment, joint venture or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business”\n for further discussions of such risks.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively in attracting and retaining customers in markets where we operate, it could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have experienced criminal cyberattacks and may experience disruption, data loss and other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly through third parties whose products and services we rely on in operating our business.\nOur business involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our customers, such as sensitive personal, account and payment information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions, financial information, and intellectual property (collectively, “Confidential Information”). Additionally, to offer services to our customers and operate our business, we utilize several applications and systems, including those we own and operate, such as our wireless network, as well as others provided to us by third parties, such as cloud service providers and SaaS companies (collectively, “Systems”).\nWe are subject to persistent cyberattacks and threats to our business from bad actors seeking to gain unauthorized access to Confidential Information and compromise Systems to undermine availability or integrity. They are perpetrated by a variety of groups and persons, including nation state-sponsored parties, malicious actors, employees, contractors, or other unrelated third parties. Some actors reside in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable.\nCyberattacks against companies like ours are increasing in frequency and scope of potential harm over time, and the methods used to gain unauthorized access constantly evolve, making it increasingly difficult to anticipate, prevent, and detect incidents successfully in every instance. In some cases, these bad actors exploit bugs, errors, misconfigurations or other vulnerabilities in our Systems to obtain Confidential Information. In other cases, these bad actors obtain unauthorized access to Confidential Information by exploiting insider access or utilizing log in credentials taken from our customers, employees, or third-party providers through credential harvesting, social engineering or other means. Other bad actors aim to cause serious operational disruptions to our business and Systems through ransomware or distributed denial of services attacks. \nAlthough we regularly work to identify, track and remedy any security vulnerabilities, given the complex nature of our Systems and the tools that are available to us, we may be unable to identify vulnerabilities in a timely manner, or to apply patches or compensating measures that address such vulnerabilities, before bad actors can exploit them. The exploitation of a security vulnerability before patches or measures are applied could materially compromise Confidential Information and Systems.\nIn addition, we routinely rely upon third-party providers whose products and services are used in our business. These third-party providers have experienced, and will continue to experience cyberattacks that involve attempts to expose our Confidential Information and/or to create operational risk that could materially and adversely affect our business, and these providers also face other security challenges common to all parties that collect and process information. Additionally, our Systems include components from third parties or fourth parties we do not control and may have compromises, defects, flaws, or design errors unknown to us.\n13\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of the previously disclosed cyberattacks in August 2021 and January 2023, we incurred significant costs in connection with, among other things, responding to and resolving mass arbitration claims, multiple class action lawsuits and an FCC investigation. For more information on the foregoing, see “– Contingencies and Litigation – Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in \nNote 1\n8\n – Commitments and Contingencies\n of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition to the August 2021 cyberattack and the January 2023 cyberattack, we have experienced unrelated non-material incidents involving unauthorized access to certain Confidential Information and Systems. Typically, these incidents have involved attempts to commit fraud by taking control of a customer’s phone line, often by exploiting insider access or using compromised credentials. In other cases, the incidents have involved unauthorized access to certain of our customers’ private information, including payment information, financial data, social security numbers or passwords, and our intellectual property. Some of these incidents have occurred at third-party providers, including third parties who provide us with various Systems and others who sell our products and services through retail locations or take care of our customers.\nIn November 2024, it was publicly reported that a nation-state actor called “Salt Typhoon” successfully infiltrated the telecommunications networks of certain of our competitors to obtain information on their customers. While we have no evidence that any of our Systems or Confidential Information were impacted in any significant way, we may face similar attempts in the future.\nOur procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to Confidential Information and to defend against cyberattacks seeking to disrupt our operations must be continually evaluated and enhanced to address the ever-evolving threat landscape and changing cybersecurity regulations, including while we adapt complex digital transformation efforts. These preventative actions require the investment of significant resources and management time and attention. Additionally, we do not have control of the cybersecurity systems, breach prevention, and response protocols of our third-party providers, including through our cybersecurity programs or policies. While T-Mobile may have contractual rights to assess the effectiveness of many of our providers’ systems and protocols, we do not have the means to always know or assess the effectiveness of all of our providers’ systems and controls. We cannot provide any assurances that actions taken by us, or our third-party providers, including through our cybersecurity programs or policies, will adequately repel a significant cyberattack or prevent or substantially mitigate the impacts of cybersecurity breaches or misuses of Confidential Information, unauthorized access to our networks or Systems or exploits against third-party environments, or that we, or our third-party providers, will be able to effectively identify, investigate, and remediate such incidents in a timely manner or at all. We expect to continue to be the target of cyberattacks, given the nature of our business, and we expect the same with respect to our third-party providers. We also expect that threat actors will continue to gain sophistication including in the use of tools and techniques (such as AI) that are specifically designed to circumvent security controls, evade detection, and obfuscate forensic evidence, making it more challenging for us to identify, investigate and recover from future cyberattacks in a timely and effective manner. In addition, we have acquired and continue to acquire companies with cybersecurity vulnerabilities or unsophisticated security measures, which exposes us to significant cybersecurity, operational, and financial risks. If we fail to protect Confidential Information or to prevent operational disruptions from future cyberattacks, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.\nIf we fail to timely adopt and effectively deploy emerging network technologies, our competitive position could erode, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur competitive advantage and reputation depend on our ability to provide industry-leading network coverage, speed, and reliability. While we have established a leadership position in 5G, the communications industry evolves rapidly, and emerging technologies – such as AI-driven Radio Access Networks (“AI-RAN”) and the potential transition to 6G – may redefine network standards and increase customer expectations. To stay ahead, we are investing in strategic collaborations with third parties, such as AI-RAN partnerships, to develop technologies that are intended to advance our network capabilities. Despite these efforts, we may encounter technical challenges, regulatory hurdles, supply chain constraints, or unexpected delays in developing and deploying new network technologies. If we fail to anticipate market trends, efficiently integrate innovative solutions into our network, or maintain the quality and reliability of our network, our market share and competitive standing could erode, adversely impacting our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to effectively execute our digital transformation and drive customer and employee adoption of emerging technologies, our competitive position and financial performance could be materially harmed.\nWe are engaged in complex digital transformation efforts intended to streamline operations, enhance customer experience, and improve our overall competitiveness. These initiatives involve integrating emerging and rapidly evolving technologies, reconfiguring internal processes, and implementing advanced data analytics and AI-driven tools, including those developed through our partnerships with a number of third-party providers. The successful execution of our planned transformation is \n14\nTable of Contents\nsubject to significant uncertainties. For example, we may face challenges in harmonizing complex system architectures, integrating new platforms with legacy infrastructure, and managing large volumes of data from disparate sources. We must also maintain rigorous data security and privacy safeguards, ensure our AI-driven solutions comply with evolving regulatory standards, and mitigate potential issues such as algorithmic bias or unintended operational disruptions. Additionally, implementing these digital solutions often requires substantial capital and operational expenditures, extensive employee training, specialized skill sets that may be difficult to source, and close coordination with multiple third-party vendors and partners. If we fail to execute these initiatives effectively, our ability to realize the intended benefits of digital transformation may be compromised. Even if we successfully deploy these capabilities, customer adoption and employee acceptance may be slower than anticipated, diminishing the expected improvements to efficiency, service quality, or revenue generation. This could materially and adversely affect our competitive position, financial performance, and brand reputation.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire a sufficient number of qualified new personnel, or maintain our corporate culture.\nOur future success depends in substantial part on our ability to attract, recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented personnel possessing the qualifications, experiences, capabilities and skills we need for all areas of our organization, including our CEO and members of our senior leadership team. Succession planning to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and a seamless transition when key personnel depart is also important to our long-term success. Additionally, as we continue to make significant investments in new technologies and new business areas, we are increasingly dependent on being able to hire and retain technically skilled employees, including those with expertise in AI and machine learning.\nBoth external factors, such as fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes in U.S. immigration policies, regulatory changes, political forces and the competitive landscape, and internal factors, such as employee tolerance for changes in our corporate culture, organizational changes, limited remote working opportunities, and our compensation programs, may impact our ability to effectively manage our workforce. Further, employee compensation and benefit costs may increase due to inflationary pressures, and if our compensation does not keep up with inflation or that of our competitors’, we may see increased employee dissatisfaction and departures or difficulty in recruiting new employees. If key employees depart or we are unable to recruit and integrate new employees successfully, our business could be negatively impacted.\nSystem failures and business disruptions may prevent us from providing reliable service, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nWe rely upon systems and networks – those of third-party suppliers and other providers, in addition to our own – to provide services to our customers. System, network, or infrastructure failures resulting from one of several potential causes may prevent us from providing reliable service or otherwise operate our business. Examples of these risks include:\n•\nphysical damage, power surges or outages, equipment failure, or other service disruptions with respect to both our wireless and wireline networks, including those resulting from severe weather, storms, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, which may occur more frequently or with greater intensity as a result of global climate change, public health crises, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility and acts of war;\n•\nhuman error due to factors such as poor change management or policy compliance;\n•\nrisks to our access to and use of reliable energy and water;\n•\nhardware or software failures or outages of our business systems or communications network;\n•\nsupplier failures or delays; and\n•\nshifts in physical conditions due to climate change, such as sea-level rise or changes in temperature or precipitation patterns, which may impact the operating conditions of our infrastructure or other infrastructure we rely on.\nSuch events could cause us to lose customers and revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to fines, penalties, adverse actions or judgments, litigation, or governmental investigations. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, costs of repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover or may not be adequate to fully reimburse us for costs and losses associated with such events, and such events may also impact the availability of insurance at costs and other terms we find acceptable for future events.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe continue to acquire and deploy new spectrum to expand and deepen our 5G coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing or changing customer demands, and deploy new technologies. In order to expand and differentiate our services from our competitors, we will continue to actively seek to make additional investments in new spectrum, which could be significant. However, we may be unable to secure the additional spectrum necessary to maintain or enhance our competitive position on favorable terms or at all.\nThe continued interest in acquiring spectrum by existing carriers and others, including speculators, may reduce our ability to acquire or renew spectrum holdings (such as 2.5Ghz), and/or increase the cost of spectrum that is made available in the secondary markets and government auctions. Additionally, the FCC may be unable to make sufficient additional spectrum available for auction to meet the demand from all interested parties. As a result, any such spectrum that is made available at auction may be subject to heightened competition and priced beyond levels we are able or willing to pay. \nEven if new spectrum becomes available to us, the FCC or other government entities may impose conditions on the acquisition and use of such spectrum, such as the configuration or geographic areas in which the spectrum may be deployed. These conditions may substantially increase the costs we incur or negatively affect the value of the spectrum to our business.\nIf we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny acquisition, divestiture, investment, joint venture or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of, investments in, or joint ventures or mergers with, other companies, or the acquisition of technologies, services, products or other assets that we believe would complement or expand our business. We may also elect to divest some of our assets to third parties. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:\n•\ndiversion of management attention from running our existing business;\n•\nincreased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base, distributors and business partners and business practices of the company involved in any such transaction with our business;\n•\nincreased interest expense and leverage or limits on other uses of cash; \n•\npotential loss of talent during integration due to differences in culture, locations, or other factors;\n•\ndifficulties in effectively integrating the financial, operational and sustainability systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial, operational and sustainability reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;\n•\nrisks of entering markets in which the Company has no or limited experience and where competitors have stronger market positions; \n•\npotential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;\n•\nsignificant transaction-related expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;\n•\nrisks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction; and\n•\nany business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.\nWe have entered into joint venture agreements aimed at establishing a robust fiber broadband network that complements our fixed wireless services. Once closed, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or disputes. Operating through joint ventures in which we do not hold a majority ownership interest results in us having limited control over many decisions made with respect to the businesses of the joint ventures. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal \n16\nTable of Contents\ncontrol over financial reporting that we follow. As a result, internal control problems may arise with respect to these joint ventures. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could also affect our reputation. \nAdditionally, in connection with our merger (the “Merger”) with Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”) and related transactions, including the acquisition by DISH of certain prepaid wireless business (the “Prepaid Transaction” and, collectively, the “Transactions”), we agreed to fulfill various government commitments (the “Government Commitments”), including, among others, extensive 5G network build-out, delivering high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans and marketing our in-home fixed wireless product to households where spectrum capacity is sufficient, as well as commitments related to national security, pricing and availability of rate plans. These Government Commitments materially increased our compliance obligations and could result in additional expenses and/or penalties in the future. In connection with the Prepaid Transaction, we and DISH entered into certain arrangements, including a Master Network Services Agreement (the “MNSA”), pursuant to which we provide DISH, for a period of seven years, network services for certain end users and infrastructure mobile network operator services to assist in the access and integration of the DISH network.\nAny failure to fulfill our obligations under the Government Commitments and the MNSA in a timely manner could result in substantial fines, penalties, or other legal and administrative actions, liabilities, and reputational harm.\nEconomic, political and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business, financial condition, and operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), supply chain disruptions, impacts of current geopolitical conflict or instability, such as the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas wars and further escalations thereof, and other macroeconomic factors. \nThe wireless industry, broadly, is dependent on population growth, as a result, we expect the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, leading to ongoing competition for customers. In addition, the Government Commitments place certain limitations on our ability to increase prices, which limits our ability to pass along growing costs to customers. Rising prices for goods, services, and labor due to inflation could adversely impact our margins and/or growth.\nOur services and device financing plans are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be vulnerable to weak economic conditions, particularly our subprime customers. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service and default on device financing plans due to an inability to pay.\nWeak economic and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers, dealers, wholesale partners or MVNOs, and enterprise and government customers, some of which may file for bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or may be unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.\nIf we do not successfully deliver new products and services, we may not realize our intended growth targets or generate the expected returns from our business, adversely affecting our financial condition, and operating results.\nWe continue to expand our offerings beyond traditional wireless services to include High Speed Internet (including fiber broadband), advertising technology and services, and specialized network solutions, such as network slicing for first responders (T-Priority) and 5G advanced network solutions (ANS) for enterprises. These new ventures require significant capital, expertise, and operational support, and their success depends on factors we cannot fully control or predict. Increased competition, technical challenges, security concerns, operational complexities, or shifting regulatory landscapes could delay product rollouts, inflate costs, or limit adoption rates. Additionally, entering new markets or lines of business may expose us to unfamiliar regulatory requirements, compliance challenges, or damage existing customer relationships. Should these new products and services fail to gain traction, generate expected returns, or deliver value to customers, we could incur substantial expenses without offsetting revenue gains, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business, and the failure or inability of such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have a diverse set of suppliers to help us develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services such as wireless and wireline network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. However, in certain areas such as, billing services, voice, and data communications transport services, wireless or wireline network infrastructure equipment, handsets, other devices, back-office processes and payment processing, there are a limited number of suppliers who can provide adequate support for us, which decreases our flexibility to switch to alternative third parties. Unexpected termination of our arrangement with any of these suppliers or difficulties in renewing our commercial arrangements with them could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations.\nOur suppliers are also subject to their own risks, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity, economic, financial and credit conditions, labor force disruptions, geopolitical tensions, disruptions in global supply chain and the risks of natural catastrophic events (such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, storms, heatwaves and fires), energy shortages, power outages, equipment failures, terrorist attacks or other hostile acts, and public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in performance below the levels required by their contracts. Our business could be severely disrupted if critical suppliers or service providers fail to comply with their contracts or if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFurther, some of our suppliers may provide services from outside of the United States, which carries additional regulatory and legal obligations. We rely on suppliers to provide us with contractual assurances and to disclose accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our policies and standards, including our Supplier Code of Conduct and our third-party risk management practices. The failure of our suppliers to comply with our expectations and policies could expose us to additional legal and litigation risks and lead to unexpected contract terminations.\nAdditionally, we rely on third-party technology partners on various projects and developments. If any of our third-party technology partners terminate or reduce their relationships with us or suspend, limit, or cease their operations, we may not be able to complete such initiatives or achieve the intended results from the partnerships, and our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nSociopolitical volatility and polarization may adversely affect our business operations and reputation.\nThe current sociopolitical environment is characterized by deep complexity, volatility, and polarization on various social and political issues. The increasing intersection of technology and politics has led to rapid and unpredictable shifts in public sentiment. Social media and digital platforms have amplified the voices of various stakeholders, creating the potential for swift change in public opinion and stronger reactions to corporate actions. As a company that sells products and services across the nation to millions of customers, these dynamics increase the risk of potential reputational damage, boycotts, and shifts in consumer behavior that could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability. Our ability to respond effectively, sensitively, and authentically to the expectations and concerns of our customers, employees, and other stakeholders is key to mitigating these risks. If we are unable to manage these challenges effectively, there may be adverse impacts to our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nAdditionally, we are subject to emerging and evolving regulatory requirements and frameworks regarding environmental, social and governance matters, including potential new or revised disclosure rules proposed by the SEC and recently enacted or proposed legislation in jurisdictions such as California. The ultimate scope of these regulations may change as they are finalized, and they may not be uniform across jurisdictions. Meeting these obligations may require significant investments of time, capital, and personnel.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility and ability to service our debt, and increase our borrowing costs.\nWe have, and we expect that we will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business, economic, market and industry conditions and increasing the amount of cash required to service our debt. In addition, this level of indebtedness may \n18\nTable of Contents\nalso reduce funds available for capital expenditures, any Board-approved share repurchases, dividends or other activities. Those impacts may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, if any, which could increase the risks associated with our capital structure.\nOur ability to service our substantial debt obligations will depend on future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, market and industry conditions and other factors. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations when due. If we are unable to meet such obligations or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing such debt obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or make additional borrowings. We may not be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt, sell assets, or make additional borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nChanges in credit market conditions and other factors could adversely affect our ability to raise debt favorably.\nInstability in the global financial markets, inflation, policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including changes in monetary policy and interest rates, and other general economic conditions could lead to volatility in the credit and equity markets. This volatility could limit our access to the capital markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Further, deterioration in our operating performance may lead to a decrease in our credit ratings, which could also impact our ability to access the debt capital markets at rates favorable or acceptable to us.\nIn addition, any hedging agreements we may enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to any debt we may incur in a foreign currency, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any posting of collateral by us under our hedging agreements and the modification or termination of any of our hedging agreements could negatively impact our liquidity or other financial metrics. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which could lead to material misstatements in our financial statements and adversely affect our operations and reputation.\nWe rely on robust internal controls to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial information and the preparation of our financial statements. These controls include, among other things, properly designed processes, clear policies and procedures, competent personnel, effective oversight functions, and reliable information systems that facilitate the collection, processing, and communication of financial data. As we continue to refine and improve our systems to align with our evolving business needs, there is no assurance that these improvements will be implemented without delays or disruptions. A failure or significant delay in updating our systems, or a failure to effectively integrate new systems with existing processes, could compromise the effectiveness of our internal controls. If our internal controls are not effectively designed or properly implemented, or if changes to our business processes or organizational structure outpace our internal controls’ ability to adapt, we could experience material weaknesses or other deficiencies.\nAny material weaknesses or other control deficiencies that may arise in the future could require significant time and resources to remediate. If we are unable to remediate material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, then our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and otherwise to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act would be negatively impacted. As a result, we could face legal fines and penalties, diminished investor confidence, and adverse impacts on our access to the capital markets, potentially resulting in a decline in our stock price and harm to our reputation.\n19\nTable of Contents\nChanges in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state, and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to, roaming, interconnection, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund (“USF”), 911 services, robocalling/robotexting, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including device financing and insurance activities.\nThe FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees or at what power levels, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between operators in the same or adjacent spectrum bands. Changes necessary to resolve interference issues or concerns may have a significant impact on our ability to fully utilize our spectrum. Additionally, the FTC and other federal and state agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection matters, and the elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless products and services.\nWe cannot assure that the FCC or any other federal, state, or local agencies will not adopt or change regulations, change or discontinue existing programs, implement new programs, or take enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations, including timing of the shutdown of legacy technologies. \nWe also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state public utility commissions. We also cannot assure that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business.\nFurther, government funded programs may be discontinued due to ongoing legal challenges to the FCC’s funding mechanism, which could result in the reduction in subsidies for low-income customers and the associated revenue.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with the FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of privacy, data protection and AI may result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.\nSince 2020, more than a dozen states have enacted new, comprehensive privacy laws that create new data privacy rights for residents of those states and new compliance obligations for us and the industry in general, in addition to private rights of action for certain types of data breaches. These include the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and similar laws in other states. Pending legislation in a number of other states would create similar laws elsewhere. All of these new privacy laws and others that we expect to be developed and enacted going forward will impose additional data protection obligations and potential liability on companies such as ours doing business in those states. Further, privacy laws also limit our ability to collect and use personal information.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, new privacy laws in other states, and their related regulations, including managing the complexity of laws that vary from state to state. Both federal and state governments are considering additional privacy laws and regulations which, if passed, could further impact our business, strategies, offerings, and initiatives and cause us to incur further costs. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the CCPA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breaches, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.\nAI-related laws and regulations continue to remain uncertain and may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our obligations to comply with the evolving legal and regulatory landscape may require us to incur significant additional costs or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our business operations or product offerings. As we integrate AI technologies into our \n20\nTable of Contents\nbusiness, we must navigate varying regulations that could impact our operations and product development. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines, penalties, or restrictions on our use of AI, which could adversely affect our business.\nUnfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\nWe and our affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, investigations and proceedings, mass arbitrations and litigation matters. For more information, see “– Contingencies and Litigation – Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in \nNote 18 – Commitments and Contingencies\n of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nIn addition, we, along with equipment manufacturers and other carriers, are subject to current and potential future lawsuits alleging adverse health effects arising from the use of wireless handsets or from wireless transmission equipment such as cell towers. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless device emissions, and its assessment of the risks associated with using wireless devices may evolve based on its findings. Any of these allegations or changes in risk assessments could result in customers purchasing fewer devices and wireless services, could result in significant legal and regulatory liability, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\nSuch legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energy of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\nOur business may be adversely impacted if we are not able to protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property assets, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and domains, to maintain our competitiveness. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property due to factors such as changes in US intellectual property laws, the value of our intellectual property may become impaired, which may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nAdditionally, we have faced and will continue to face various litigations alleging that our products or services infringe patents or other intellectual property of third parties, including potential litigation arising from our use of AI. If successful, these litigations could result in an award of financial compensation, including damages or royalties, business disruptions, reputational harm, or an order requiring that we cease offering, selling, and using the relevant products, equipment, services, and network functions. Defending against such litigation is not only costly and time-consuming, but it may also be disruptive to our business operations and divert resources and attention. Furthermore, the outcomes of these litigations are inherently uncertain.\nOur suppliers and vendors also have and will continue to face intellectual property litigation related to the technology used in the products, equipment, and services they provide to us. If successful, such litigation against our suppliers and vendors might impact their ability to continue to provide the relevant products, equipment, and services to us.\nWe offer regulated financial services products. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations.\nThe financing of devices, such as through our EIP, impact our regulatory compliance obligations. Failure to remain compliant with applicable regulations may increase our risk exposure in the following areas:\n•\nconsumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, state attorneys general, the FCC and the FTC; and\n•\nregulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits. Failure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur business may be impacted by new or amended tax laws or regulations or administrative interpretations and judicial decisions affecting the scope or application of tax laws or regulations.\nIn connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, fees and regulatory charges (“tax” or “taxes”) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal and state USF contributions and common carrier regulatory charges and public safety fees. As many of our service plans offer taxes and fees inclusive, our business results could be adversely impacted by increases in taxes and fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local transaction taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the laws are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws may be uncertain and subject to different interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud-related services. Legislative changes, administrative interpretations and judicial decisions affecting the scope or application of tax laws could also impact revenue reported and taxes due on tax inclusive plans. Additionally, failure to comply with any of the tax laws could subject us to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions.\nIn the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes and regulatory or public safety charges on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes or charges, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws.\nOur existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the period for which they are granted. Our licenses have been granted with an expectation of renewal, and the FCC generally has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements, and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings, which could limit the ability of our stockholders to obtain a judicial forum of their choice for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or employees.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or employee of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Company's bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim arising under, in connection with, and governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision does not waive our compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Moreover, the provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThis choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could increase our costs of litigation and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n22\nTable of Contents\nDT controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock and the T-Mobile trademarks we utilize in our business and may have interests that differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nDT controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock and therefore we are a “controlled company,” as defined in the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) listing rules, and we are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies generally receive with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.\nIn addition, pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation and the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement, as long as DT beneficially owns 30% or more of our outstanding common stock, we are restricted from taking certain actions without DT’s prior written consent, including (i) incurring indebtedness above certain levels based on a specified debt to cash flow ratio, (ii) taking any action that would cause a default under any instrument evidencing indebtedness involving DT or its affiliates, (iii) acquiring or disposing of assets or entering into mergers or similar acquisitions in excess of $1.0 billion, (iv) changing the size of our Board of Directors, (v) subject to certain exceptions, issuing equity of 10% or more of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock, or issuing equity to redeem debt held by DT, (vi) repurchasing or redeeming equity securities or making any extraordinary or in-kind dividend other than on a pro rata basis, or (vii) making certain changes involving our CEO. We are also restricted from amending our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws in any manner that could adversely affect DT’s rights under the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement for as long as DT beneficially owns 5% or more of our outstanding common stock. These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our Board of Directors might otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nDT effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our Certificate of Incorporation, a sale or merger of our Company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. DT’s controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the Company and DT, as the controlling stockholder, may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from those of our other stockholders, including as the holder of a portion of our debt and as the counterparty in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.\nIn addition, we license certain trademarks from DT, including the right to use the trademark “T-Mobile” as a name for the Company and our flagship brand under a trademark license agreement, as amended, with DT. As described in more detail in our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 24, 2024 under the heading “Transactions with Related Persons and Approval,” we are obligated to pay DT a royalty in an amount equal to 0.25% (the “royalty rate”) of the net revenue (as defined in the trademark license) generated by products and services sold by the Company under the licensed trademarks subject to a cap of $80 million per calendar year through December 31, 2028. We and DT are obligated to negotiate a new trademark license when (i) DT has 50% or less of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or (ii) any third party owns or controls, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or otherwise has the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company. If we and DT fail to agree on a new trademark license, either we or DT may terminate the trademark license and such termination shall be effective, in the case of clause (i) above, on the third anniversary after a notice of termination and, in the case of clause (ii) above, on the second anniversary after a notice of termination. A further increase in the royalty rate or termination of the trademark license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe cannot guarantee that our current and future stockholder return programs will be fully utilized or that they will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized, and may from time to time authorize, stockholder return programs, consisting of repurchases of shares of our common stock, the payment of cash dividends, or both. The specific timing and amount of any share repurchases and any dividend payments under any stockholder return program will depend on prevailing share prices, general economic and market conditions, Company performance and other considerations, such as whether the Company determines that there are other uses for the funds currently authorized for the program that would be more advantageous for our business. In addition, the specific timing and amount of any dividend payments are subject to declaration on future dates by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. \n23\nTable of Contents\nAny stockholder return program could impact our cash flows and affect the trading price of our common stock and increase volatility. We cannot guarantee that any stockholder return program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Our current and future stockholder return programs do not, and will not, obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock or to declare and pay any particular amount of dividends, and any program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. Any announcement of termination of any program may result in a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock by DT and SoftBank and foreign ownership limitations by the FCC could have a negative impact on our stock price and decrease the value of our stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock by DT or SoftBank will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe and DT are parties to the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement pursuant to which DT is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in a third party owning more than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer were to exceed the 30% threshold, it would be prohibited unless the transfer were approved by our Board of Directors, or the transferee were to make a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by DT. Moreover, the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement generally requires us to cooperate with DT to facilitate the resale of our common stock or debt securities held by DT under shelf registration statements we have filed.\nThe sale of shares of our common stock by DT or SoftBank (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. In addition, even if DT or SoftBank does not sell a large number of their shares into the market, their rights to transfer a large number of shares into the market could depress our stock price.\nFurthermore, under existing law, no more than 20% of an FCC licensee’s capital stock may be directly owned, or no more than 25% indirectly owned, or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. If an FCC licensee is controlled by another entity, up to 25% of that entity’s capital stock may be owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. Foreign ownership above the 25% holding company level may be allowed if the FCC finds such higher levels consistent with the public interest. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest with respect to investors from certain nations. If our foreign ownership by previously unapproved foreign parties were to exceed the permitted level without further FCC authorization, the FCC could subject us to a range of penalties, including an order for us to divest the foreign ownership in part, fines, license revocation or denials of license renewals. If ownership of our common stock by an unapproved foreign entity were to become subject to such limitations, or if any ownership of our common stock violates any other rule or regulation of the FCC applicable to us, our Certificate of Incorporation provides for certain redemption provisions at a pre-determined price which may be less than fair market value. These limitations and our Certificate of Incorporation may limit our ability to attract additional equity financing outside the United States and decrease the value of our common stock.",

Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nOur Cybersecurity Approach and Integration\nWe have implemented processes for overseeing and identifying material risks from \ncybersecurity threats, and our cybersecurity processes are integrated into the Company’s overall risk management system and processes.\n \nAs part of management’s oversight of cybersecurity, our Chief Security Officer (“CSO”) presents on our cybersecurity practices to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors (the “NCG Committee”) and to our full Board of Directors on a periodic basis. Our Senior Vice President, Internal Audit & Risk Management (the “Chief Audit Executive”), periodically presents enterprise risks, including cybersecurity risks, to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”). Our \n24\nTable of Contents\nChief Compliance Officer regularly attends meetings of the NCG Committee to provide insights from the compliance perspective relating to cybersecurity.\nCyber risk management is a core component of the Company's governance structure. We utilize the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework as a guide in cyber risk management to identify, assess, and assist the CSO in managing cybersecurity risks. Cyber risk management encompasses partnerships among teams that are responsible for cyber governance, prevention, detection, and remediation activities within the Company’s cybersecurity environment. As part of our cyber risk management efforts, we conduct periodic reviews and collaborate with enterprise-wide risk assessments to assess and manage cybersecurity risks. Our cybersecurity team also provides enterprise-wide cybersecurity training for employees to continuously improve our mitigation against human-driven vulnerabilities. \nOur management also conducts a quarterly enterprise-wide risk assessment that considers a wide spectrum of risks facing the Company, including cybersecurity. Through these quarterly risk assessments, management informs the Audit Committee on the cyber risk landscape facing the Company and the Company’s preparedness to manage such risk. The enterprise-wide risk assessment is a top-down risk assessment that leverages the assessments performed by cyber risk management. \nEngagement with External Experts\nThe Company engages top-tier external cyber security firms, as needed, leveraging their expertise as part of our ongoing effort to evaluate and enhance our cybersecurity program. They help with cyber defense capabilities (including staff enhancement of certain functions) and transformation to mitigate associated threats, reduce risk, enhance our cybersecurity posture, and meet the Company's evolving needs.\nOversight of Third-Party Service Providers\nOur third-party risk management program includes processes for identifying and managing material cybersecurity risks arising from third-party providers. Our third-party risk management program actively engages with the enterprise-wide risk assessment process and partners with cyber risk management to report relevant risks to the NCG Committee, the Audit Committee and our internal Enterprise Risk & Compliance Committee. Our third-party risk management program includes cybersecurity as an aspect of its risk assessment of third parties with the objective that key risks are identified and addressed. Moreover, the program also considers risks associated with certain fourth parties, entities that are partners or subcontractors of our direct third-party vendors, through assessments carried out by our third-party service providers.\nCybersecurity Incident Impact\nAs previously disclosed, in August 2021, we experienced a cybersecurity incident that resulted in numerous lawsuits, including mass arbitration claims and multiple class action lawsuits. In January 2023, we experienced another cybersecurity incident that also resulted in consumer class actions and regulatory inquiries. As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack and the January 2023 cyberattack, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs or experience other material financial impacts, which may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, our cyber liability insurance, and such costs and impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\n For additional details regarding the impact of both cybersecurity incidents, see \nNote 1\n8\n – Commitments and Contingencies\n of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nWe have not identified other known risks from previous cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us. However, we face ongoing risks from certain cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\n See “Risk Factors – \nWe have experienced criminal cyberattacks and could in the future be further harmed by disruption, data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly through third parties whose products and services we rely on in operating our business\n.”\nGovernance\nDisclosure of Management’s Responsibilities\nTransformation and Chief Information & Digital Officer \nThe Transformation and Chief Information & Digital Officer under the direction of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for overseeing the Company’s information technology systems, digital capabilities, and cybersecurity practices. \nThe CSO, under the direction of the Transformation and Chief Information & Digital Officer, is responsible for overseeing the \n25\nTable of Contents\ncybersecurity organization and promoting a security-centric culture throughout our business and operational functions.\n The CSO is at the forefront of enhancing our cybersecurity framework and strengthening the overall cybersecurity program. This involves upgrading tools and capabilities, which are part of a broader, multi-year strategy to continue to enhance security measures. The CSO oversees the cyber risk management function, which identifies cybersecurity threats, assesses cybersecurity risks and supports the Transformation and Chief Information & Digital Officer and the Company in managing such risks. \nAs the Company’s Executive Vice President, Transformation and Chief Information & Digital Officer, Néstor Cano has served in several leadership positions at both the Company and Sprint, including as Sprint’s Chief Operating Officer, overseeing, among other things, Sprint’s digital architecture and delivery. Mr. Cano studied industrial engineering at Barcelona Polytechnic University, attended the Executive Distribution Academy by INSEAD Business School in Fontainebleau, France, and also completed his post-graduate degree in executive management at IESE Business School in Barcelona, Spain. \nAs the Company’s CSO, Jeff Simon has extensive experience in risk management and information security, including serving as the Chief Information Security Officer at Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Mr. Simon received his Master of Science in Computer Science, Software Engineering & Artificial Intelligence from the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Applied Economics from Marquette University. Mr. Simon is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional.\nEnterprise Risk & Compliance Committee \nOur Enterprise Risk & Compliance Committee is comprised of a collective of senior management representatives and subject matter experts from across the Company. The Enterprise Risk & Compliance Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, with the Executive Vice President & General Counsel as the co-chair and comprises core members including the Transformation and Chief Information & Digital Officer, while the CSO serves in an advisory capacity. The purpose of the Enterprise Risk & Compliance Committee is to oversee and govern the Company’s risk management, environmental, social, corporate governance, cybersecurity, and operational compliance activities, as well as provide a means of bringing risk issues to the attention of management. Specific to cybersecurity, the Transformation and Chief Information & Digital Officer and the CSO have the expertise to provide insights into the nature of cyber threats, the Company’s readiness, and actions taken to mitigate such risks. \nDisclosure of the Board’s Roles and Responsibilities\nOur Board of Directors oversees risks from cybersecurity threats using a multi-faceted approach that involves the NCG Committee and Audit Committee and various executive roles. Additionally, our Transformation and Chief Information & Digital Officer and CSO report on cybersecurity to the full Board.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nThe NCG Committee oversees risks associated with data privacy and information security, which encompasses cybersecurity. Our CSO and Chief Compliance Officer, among other executives, provide periodic reports to the NCG Committee and also meet with the NCG Committee to discuss any material events when they arise. The periodic reports are designed to keep the NCG Committee abreast of the Company’s cybersecurity practices, risks and trends in cybersecurity threats. The NCG Committee also has discussions with management focused on evaluating the Company’s exposure to cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity practices in place to mitigate such risks. These discussions enable the NCG Committee to be informed of the steps management is taking to detect, monitor and manage cybersecurity risks. These reports to the NCG Committee typically include information on any significant incidents that have occurred, how they were managed, and any changes to the risk profile of the Company. The NCG Committee seeks updates to facilitate proactive governance and to allow the NCG Committee to address emerging cybersecurity issues with management.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee is integral to overseeing the Company’s overall risk management strategies, including cybersecurity risks and disclosures.\n \nTo keep the Audit Committee informed, the Chief Audit Executive maintains a direct and open communication channel with the Audit Committee. Regular meetings are held for the Chief Audit Executive to report to the Audit Committee. These include an enterprise-wide risk assessment that highlights cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity risk mitigation actions. Additionally, the Audit Committee receives updates on significant incidents and cybersecurity risks that have been presented to or discussed with the Enterprise Risk & Compliance Committee.\n26\nTable of Contents"
