The vendor neutral portion of the portfolio allows the business to perform relatively independent from our instrument business.\nAgilent CrossLab Sales, Marketing and Support\nWe deploy a multi-channel approach, marketing services to our customers through direct sales, electronic commerce, resellers, manufacturers' representatives and distributors. We primarily use direct sales to market our solutions to our large accounts. Sales agents supplement direct sales by providing broader geographic coverage and coverage of smaller accounts. Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our customers. Some of our service contract sales are processed by our digital commerce infrastructure. All channels are supported by technical product and application specialists to meet our customers' specific requirements.\nWe deliver our support services to customers in a variety of ways, including on-site assistance with repair or exchange of returned products, as well as a growing number of remote service delivery options. In addition to the traditional telephone support and on-site service, our teams remotely engage customers through various digital tools and omni-channel platforms. We also offer special industry-focused service bundles that are designed to meet the specific needs of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical, advanced materials, environmental and hydrocarbon processing customers to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements. Our products typically come with standard warranties, and extended warranties are available for additional cost.\nAgilent CrossLab Manufacturing\nOur direct service delivery organization is regionally based and operating in 28 countries.\nAgilent CrossLab Competition\nOur principal competitors in the services arena include many of our competitors from the instrument business such as: Danaher Corporation, PerkinElmer Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Waters Corporation, as well as numerous niche service providers. We compete on the basis of reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.\n12\nTable of Contents\n            \nGlobal Infrastructure Organization\nWe provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, tax, treasury, legal, real estate, insurance services, workplace services, human resources, information technology services, quality and regulatory services, corporate development and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Generally, these organizations are managed from Santa Clara, California, with operations and services provided worldwide. As of October 31, 2024, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 1,900 people worldwide.\nAgilent Order Fulfillment Organizations\nOur order fulfillment and supply chain organization (“OFS”) focuses on order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses. OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering, logistics, and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. In general, OFS employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses.\n       \nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials,  Environmental, Regulatory Affairs and Human Capital Management include information common to each of our businesses.\nResearch and Development\nWe anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.\nBacklog\nWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter's orders. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.\nIntellectual Property \nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\nMaterials \nOur life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\n13\nTable of Contents\n            \nEnvironmental\nOur research and development, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws. We also maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\nClimate change may impact our business by increasing operating costs due to impairments of our facilities and distribution systems, disruptions to our manufacturing processes and additional regulatory requirements. Although we address these potential risks in our business continuity planning, such events could make it difficult for us to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur substantial expense.\nIn addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations, we strive to advance our sustainability practices. In 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  In 2023, we announced near and long\n \nterm greenhouse gas emission reduction targets which were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (\"SBTi\"). We also aim to provide transparency on our approach to sustainability management through our annual ESG report.\nRegulatory Affairs\nA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities, from quality management, design and development to manufacturing, labeling, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with FDA regulations and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. In Europe, the European Union has started to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (“EU IVDR”), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical evidence requirements, quality management systems and post-market surveillance activities. The EU IVDR requirements became effective starting in May 2022.  \nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.\nWe are also subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results.\nIn addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR”), Brazil’s \nLei Geral de Protecao de Dados\n, China's Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning \n14\nTable of Contents\n            \nprivacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, with many such laws imposing significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.\nWhile we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to operate and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of October 31, 2024, we employed approximately 17,900 persons, of whom approximately 7,000 were based in the Americas, 4,400 in Europe and 6,500 in Asia Pacific. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs. \nMission.\n Our instruments, software, services, solutions and people provide trusted answers to customers’ most challenging questions. Whether we are working with our customers to keep food supplies safe, improve the quality of air, water and soil, or fight cancer with more precise diagnoses and targeted treatments, our employees share a passion and commitment to advancing the quality of life. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees in order to fulfill that commitment.\nEngagement.\n We engage with our employees through consultation, surveys, ad-hoc feedback and reviews. Our executive officers hold all-managers meetings on a quarterly basis to provide business updates and answer questions. We conduct an annual leadership survey that allows employees to provide feedback on leadership effectiveness, culture and job satisfaction. We have an open-door policy where employees are encouraged and empowered to bring issues to management’s attention. Employees have regular performance reviews with immediate supervisors. Employee sessions are held regularly to share business and market updates and answer employee questions.  \nDiversity and Inclusion.\n As a global company, much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from providing managers transparency of their workforce pay equity to working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds. Agilent is committed to creating a diverse work environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe in an inclusive workforce, where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents. As of October 31, 2024, approximately 38 percent of our full-time employees were female. Approximately 50 percent of our board is comprised of directors representing underrepresented groups as of the date of this report. We have launched a number of company-wide initiatives including employee-network groups aimed at promoting engagement of traditionally historically underrepresented groups of employees. \nRetention\n. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. Our benefits are offered to eligible employees and comply with local legal requirements. We have a number of programs and policies designed to help employees in our diverse workforce manage their work and personal lives while meeting company objectives for business success, including flexible work arrangements, health and welfare benefits, employee and family assistance plans and parental leave.\nDevelopment\n. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development for current and rising managers. Training at Agilent takes several forms: face-to-face classroom experiences, on-the-job learning, virtual classroom events and self-paced e-learning. We are committed to providing an environment in which employees can expand their knowledge, develop new skills, and contribute their best work. Our culture of continuous development instills in our employees the behaviors that bring our values to life every day. We encourage our people to stay up-to-date on current research and technology while enhancing their current skills and growing new skills to meet future needs; we also put special emphasis on training managers at all levels to effectively communicate, role model and reinforce our values and culture.\nHealth and Safety.\n The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us.  Our environmental, health and safety (\"EHS\") management system provides a framework for assessing and managing risks relating to health and safety. We ensure managers and employees receive periodic workplace safety training and provide wellness programs that contribute to the productivity, health, and well-being of employees. In addition, our crisis management program includes a global tool that \n15\nTable of Contents\n            \nenables us to reach, locate and support employees in travel or in crisis areas. We regularly evaluate and review with senior management the performance of our programs and processes.\nCommunity\n. Each year our employees throughout the world devote thousands of volunteer hours to community service activities. Our employees may take up to six days of paid time off each year for volunteer activities with charities and organizations. We also support a giving program, which provides employees the opportunity to support a broad range of eligible non-profit organizations in their communities in the areas of health and human services, arts and culture, education and literacy, environment and conservation, and family and civic betterment.\nInformation about our Executive Officers \nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\nHenrik Ancher-Jensen, \n59, has served as our Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Order Fulfillment and Supply chain since September 2013.
