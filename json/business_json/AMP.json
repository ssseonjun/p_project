    "item1": "Item 1.  Business \nOverview\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc. is a diversified financial services company with a 130-year history of providing solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives. Ameriprise Financial, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Delaware that primarily engages in business through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, references to “Ameriprise,” “Ameriprise Financial,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” may refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. \nWe are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice offering a broad range of products and services designed to assist individual and institutional clients achieve their financial objectives. Our strategy is centered on helping clients confidently achieve their goals by providing holistic advice and by managing and protecting their assets and income. We utilize two go-to-market approaches in carrying out this strategy: Wealth Management and Asset Management.\nWealth Management\nOur wealth management business is the primary growth engine of Ameriprise with a significant market opportunity. We are in a compelling position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends driving increased demand for financial advice and solutions. In the United States (“U.S.”), the ongoing transition of baby boomers into retirement, as well as younger generations currently building their wealth and planning for retirement, continues to drive demand for financial advice and solutions. Our primary target market is households with $500,000 to $5,000,000 in investable assets. We are also well-suited to serve those outside this asset range as we also offer products and services designed for higher-net worth households. \nWe are an industry-leading wealth manager with a differentiated advice value proposition. Our network of more than 10,000 financial advisors (our “advisors”) is the primary channel through which we carry out our wealth management activities. Our capabilities are centered on establishing long-term personal relationships between clients and advisors. Through our affiliated advisors, we offer financial planning and advice, cash management and banking products, and full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients.\nOur branded advisor force is among the largest in the industry and is central to how we serve our clients. We support our advisors with an integrated technology platform, training, leadership and marketing programs to assist them in serving clients and growing their practices. Our nationally recognized brand, combined with these programs and other support, creates a compelling value proposition for financial advisors relative to the broader financial services industry. This is evidenced by our strong advisor retention and satisfaction and our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors. We continuously invest in, develop, and refine capabilities and tools designed to maximize advisor productivity and client satisfaction.\nWe design products and services as solutions for clients’ cash and liquidity, asset accumulation, retirement, protection, income generation and disbursement and estate and wealth transfer needs. The financial solutions we offer through our advisors include our own products and services as well as other providers’ products. We distribute our life and disability income insurance, as well as annuity products, through our advisor channel under the\n RiverSource\n®\n brand.\nAsset Management\nOur global asset management business, represented by the \nColumbia Threadneedle Investments\n®\n brand, offers a broad spectrum of capabilities to individual, institutional and high net worth investors. \nColumbia Threadneedle\n®\n \ninvestment products are primarily offered through third parties, though we also provide our asset management products through our advisor network, direct retail and through our institutional sales force. Our underlying asset management philosophy is rooted in delivering consistently strong, competitive investment performance.\nWe are positioned to grow our assets under management and advisement and strengthen our asset management offerings to existing and new clients. We benefit from key strategic relationships we have established and have a strong institutional presence. Our asset management capabilities are designed to address mature markets in the U.S. and Europe while expanding into new global and emerging markets. We have expanded beyond our traditional strengths in the U.S. and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) to serve more clients and gather assets worldwide. We continue to pursue opportunities to leverage the collective capabilities of our global asset management business in order to enhance our investment solutions and to develop new solutions that are responsive to client demand in an increasingly complex and competitive marketplace.\nHistory and Development\nOur company has provided solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives for 130 years. Our earliest predecessor company, Investors Syndicate, was founded in 1894 to provide face-amount certificates to consumers. In 1983, our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in connection with American Express’ acquisition of IDS Financial Services from Alleghany Corporation. We changed our name to “American Express Financial Corporation” (“AEFC”) and began marketing our \n1\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nproducts and services under the American Express brand in 1994. In 2005, AEFC spun off from American Express to form Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\nWe have grown both organically through the products and services we provide, as well as inorganically through strategic acquisitions. This has allowed us to significantly enhance the scale, performance, and product offerings of our brokerage, financial planning, managed accounts, retail mutual fund and institutional asset management businesses to best serve clients. Our acquisitions have included, among others, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings, H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc., J. & W. Seligman & Co. Incorporated, Columbia Management, Investment Professionals, Inc., and, most recently, BMO Financial Group’s European-based asset management business. Beyond traditional acquisitions, we pursue other strategies to grow our wealth management business such as experienced advisor recruiting, practice acquisitions, advisor loans, and partnerships with banks and credit unions.\nOver the years, we have also sought to optimize the organizational structure in which we offer certain banking products. In May 2019, we converted Ameriprise National Trust Bank to Ameriprise Bank, FSB (“Ameriprise Bank”) to expand the products and services we provide directly to our clients. At that time, Ameriprise Financial became a savings and loan holding company subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”), and Ameriprise Financial elected to be classified as a financial holding company subject to applicable regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. \nOur Business Mix and Integrated Model \nThe financial results from the businesses underlying our go-to-market approaches are reflected in our operating segments:\n•\nAdvice & Wealth Management;\n•\nAsset Management;\n•\nRetirement & Protection Solutions; and                      \n•\nCorporate & Other.\nAs a diversified financial services firm, we believe our ability to gather and retain assets is best measured by our aggregate assets under management and administration metric. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.5 trillion in assets under management, administration, and advisement, compared to $1.4 trillion as of December 31, 2023. For a more detailed discussion of assets under management, administration, and advisement, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nWe continue to execute on our strategy to grow our Advice & Wealth Management business with complementary Asset Management and Retirement & Protection Solutions businesses. Our integrated model leverages key business linkages to drive growth and consistency across market cycles. The following chart shows our current business mix represented by the contributions of each segment to our pretax adjusted operating earnings (excluding Corporate & Other segment) as well as a historical comparison. \nOur Principal Brands\nOur diversified products and services are offered through our brands: \nWe use the \nAmeriprise Financial\n®\n brand as our enterprise brand, as well as the name of our advisor network and certain of our retail products and services.\nOur global \nColumbia Threadneedle\n®\n and \nColumbia Threadneedle Investments\n®\n brands represent the combined capabilities, resources and reach of Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (including its subsidiaries, “Columbia Management”), other U.S.-based entities and Threadneedle. The foreign operations of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. are conducted primarily through Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Limited, TAM UK International Holdings Limited and Ameriprise Asset Management Holdings Singapore (Pte.) Ltd. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, “Threadneedle”).\nWe use our \nRiverSource\n®\n brand for our annuity and protection products issued by RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”) and RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York (“RiverSource Life of NY” and, together with RiverSource Life, the “RiverSource Life companies” or “RiverSource”).\nOur Segments - Advice & Wealth Management\nWe provide financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our financial advisors provide a distinctive, holistic approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both our and other providers’ products to help clients meet their financial needs and goals. Banking, lending, and cash management solutions help clients establish financial flexibility while planning for both short and long-term needs. As part of our goal-based approach to financial advice, our advisors help clients actively manage investing, saving and spending so they have a more complete financial picture. \n3\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nA significant portion of revenues in this segment are fee-based and driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net flows. We also earn revenue and income through other sources, including the following:\n•\nWe earn net investment income on owned assets from Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”) and Ameriprise Bank, both wholly owned subsidiaries of Ameriprise.\n•\nWe earn financial planning fees as well as transaction and other fees. \n•\nWe earn distribution fees for providing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues for providing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.\nOur Financial Advisor Platform\nWith more than 10,000 advisors, we are one of the top branded advisor platforms in the U.S. market. Advisors can choose to affiliate with us in multiple ways as noted below, and each option offers different levels of support and compensation. \nWe offer the following products and services through our Advice & Wealth Management segment: \n•\nFinancial planning and advice services to provide personalized financial planning and financial solutions for which we charge fees and may receive sales commissions for selling products that aid in our clients’ plans. \n•\nDiscretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory accounts (also known as managed accounts) for which we receive fees based on the assets held in that account, as well as related fees or costs associated with the underlying securities held in that account. \n•\nBrokerage products and services for retail and institutional clients.\n•\nCash management and banking products, including brokerage sweep programs, cash management accounts, savings accounts, residential mortgage loans, credit cards, margin loans and pledged asset lines of credit.\n•\nFace-amount certificates through ACC. \n•\nMutual fund offerings from our Columbia funds as well as approximately 130 unaffiliated mutual fund families, representing approximately 2,125 mutual funds on our brokerage platform for which mutual fund families and other companies generally pay us a portion of the revenue generated from sales of those funds, administrative fees, and fees from the ongoing management attributable to our clients’ ownership in the fund.\n•\nInsurance and annuities products from both RiverSource Life companies as well as third parties, and we receive a portion of the revenue generated from the sale of unaffiliated products and certain administrative fees.\nOur Segments - Asset Management\nThrough Columbia Threadneedle, we provide investment management, advice and products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients on a global scale.\nColumbia Management primarily provides products and services in the U.S. Threadneedle primarily provides products and services internationally. \n4\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nRevenues in the Asset Management segment are primarily earned based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. As of December 31, 2024, our Asset Management segment had $681 billion in managed and advised assets.\nOur Asset Management segment also provides asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management and Retirement & Protection Solutions segments. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.\nManaged assets include external client assets and owned assets. Managed external client assets include client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the \nColumbia Threadneedle Investments\n fund families and the assets of institutional clients. Managed external client assets also include assets managed by sub-advisers we select but do not include client assets that we advise on a non-discretionary basis such as those assets where we provide voting recommendations and engagement services but do not manage the underlying assets. Our external client assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, although certain investment funds marketed to investors may be consolidated at certain times. See Note 2 and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on consolidation principles and details regarding the consolidated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). Managed owned assets include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (such as the assets of the general account, cash balances invested by Ameriprise Bank and from certificate products, and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of RiverSource Life companies) for which the Asset Management segment provides management services and receives management fees. For additional details regarding our assets under management and administration, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment Management Capabilities and Products\nOur investment management business has a presence in 16 key markets globally, including France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S. \nOur investment management capabilities and products span a broad range of asset classes and investment styles to meet a variety of client needs with our $645 billion in assets under management diversified across geographies, strategies and clients as depicted in the graphic below. \n5\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nWe offer or make available the following products and services through our Asset Management segment with a range of investment strategies across these different vehicles and accounts:\n•\nU.S. registered funds through the \nColumbia Management\n family of funds, including retail mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and U.S. closed-end funds and variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) on which we earn management fees based on the underlying value of the assets and service fees.\n•\nNon-U.S. retail focused funds through Columbia Threadneedle, which include different risk-return options across regions, markets, asset classes and product structures, including retail funds that are similar to U.S. mutual funds (such as Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”) funds organized as Luxembourg-based investment companies with variable capital (“SICAVs”) and Irish and U.K. open-end investment companies (“OEICs”)). In addition, this also includes a range of listed Investment Trusts.\n•\nEuropean-based pooled investment funds designed for pensions, insurance companies and other institutional investors seeking solutions for liability or balance sheet asset management (“Liability Driven Investment” or “LDI”). \n•\nInstitutional and retail separately managed accounts for a range of clients, including pension, profit-sharing, employee savings, sovereign wealth funds and endowment funds, accounts of large- and medium-sized businesses and governmental clients, as well as the accounts of high net worth individuals and smaller institutional clients, including tax-exempt and not-for-profit organizations for which we receive management and performance-related fees.\n•\nOther separately managed accounts, including those offered through models that represent assets under advisement, for which we earn asset management fees based on model delivery assets under advisement. \n•\nManagement of owned assets such as assets held in the general account of our RiverSource Life companies, ACC and Ameriprise Bank. \n•\nManagement of CLOs, which includes providing collateral management services to special purpose vehicles that primarily invest in syndicated bank loans and issue multiple tranches of securities collateralized by the assets for which we earn fees based on the value of assets and performance-based fees.\n•\nPrivate funds of various types where we provide investment management and related services to private, pooled investment vehicles organized as limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or other entities for which we may receive fees based on the value of the assets or performance-based fees.\n•\nCollective funds and separately managed accounts sponsored by Ameriprise Trust Company (“ATC”), a wholly owned subsidiary, and offered to certain qualified institutional clients such as retirement, pension, and profit-sharing plans for which we receive management fees. \n•\nSub-advised accounts for certain U.S. and non-U.S. funds, private banking individually managed accounts, common trust funds, and other portfolios sponsored or advised by other firms for which we earn management fees and performance-based fees.\nDistribution\nWe maintain distribution teams and capabilities that aid the sales, marketing, and support of the products and services of our global asset management business. These distribution activities are generally organized into two major categories: retail distribution and institutional/high net worth distribution. However, alternatives and certain other areas have a level of specialized distribution.\nOur Segments - Retirement & Protection Solutions\nRiverSource solutions are available within the Ameriprise client experience and \nConfident Retirement\n®\n approach. We offer clients annuities, life insurance and disability income insurance products to meet their needs or current stage in life—whether that is covering essentials, ensuring lifestyle, preparing for the unexpected or leaving a legacy. RiverSource seeks to partner with our advisors to address clients’ goals and long-term needs at a differentiated level and provide a strong risk profile.\nRetirement Solutions\nThrough our advisors, we provide \nRiverSource\n annuity products to help clients address their asset accumulation and income goals. Our advisor network is the only distributor of new \nRiverSource\n annuity products, although our advisors offer fixed, variable, and structured annuities from selected unaffiliated insurers. As part of the continued evolution of the business model for our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment, we focus on the accumulation solutions clients want (such as the structured variable annuity, a registered index-linked annuity).\nRevenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on a contractholder’s benefit base, contract value or separate account values, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on general account assets supporting reserves for non-life contingent payout annuities, structured variable annuities, certain guaranteed benefits and fixed investment options offered with variable annuities, and on capital supporting the business. In addition, we receive fees charged on assets allocated to our separate accounts to cover administrative costs and a portion of the management fees from the underlying investment accounts in which assets are invested. Revenues for our payout annuities with a life contingent feature are earned as premium revenue. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds. Intersegment expenses for this segment include \n6\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\ndistribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.\nProtection Solutions\nWe provide life and disability income insurance products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients. New \nRiverSource\n insurance products are exclusively offered through our advisor network. Our advisors also offer insurance products of unaffiliated carriers. The primary sources of revenues for our protection business are premiums, fees, and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and on capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of the RiverSource Life companies’ separate account assets supporting variable universal life investment options. The protection products earn intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the variable universal life contracts. Intersegment expenses for the protection products include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.\nProducts\nWe currently offer the following RiverSource Life products:\n•\nVariable annuities that provide returns linked to underlying investments of the contractholder’s choice of certain funds, as well as additional benefits, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits (but without living benefits for new sales after mid-2022). \n•\nStructured variable annuities that use the performance of an underlying equity market index to determine earnings, subject to either a cap or floor. \n•\nVariable universal life insurance that provides life insurance coverage along with investment returns linked to underlying investment accounts of the policyholder’s choice. \n•\nUniversal life insurance that credits interest at fixed interest rates. Universal life insurance may also contain product features that credit interest at a rate linked to an underlying equity market index.  \n•\nTerm life insurance that provides a death benefit, but does not accumulate cash value. \n•\nDisability income insurance that provides monthly benefits to individuals who are unable to earn income either at their occupation at time of disability or at any suitable occupation for premium payments that are guaranteed not to change.\nOur sales of \nRiverSource\n individual life insurance in 2024, as measured by scheduled annual premiums, lump sum and excess premiums and single premiums, consisted of approximately 96% variable universal life, 1% universal life and 3% term life. \nReinsurance\nWe reinsure a portion of the insurance risks associated with our currently offered life and disability income products (as well as previously sold fixed annuity, fixed indexed annuity, life contingent payout annuity and long term care products) through reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. We use reinsurance to limit losses, reduce exposure to large risks and provide additional capacity for continued product offerings. To manage exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties and on a periodic basis during the terms of the treaties. Our RiverSource Life companies remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. See Note 7 and Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on reinsurance. At a general level, we reinsure some or all of the following (with the closed blocks in our Corporate & Other segment):\nProduct\nReinsurance Type\nTerm Life and Disability Income\nCoinsurance\nUniversal Life & Variable Universal Life\nRenewable Term\nLife Contingent Payout Annuity\nCoinsurance\nFixed Annuity (closed block in Corporate & Other)\nCoinsurance\nLong Term Care (closed block in Corporate & Other)\nCoinsurance\nOur Segments - Corporate & Other\nOur Corporate & Other segment consists of closed blocks of business and net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses.\nClosed Block Long Term Care Insurance\nPrior to December 31, 2002, the RiverSource Life companies underwrote stand-alone long term care (“LTC”) insurance. We discontinued offering LTC insurance as of December 31, 2002. A large majority of our closed block LTC is comprised of nursing home indemnity LTC or comprehensive reimbursement LTC. Generally, our policyholders are eligible for LTC benefits if they become cognitively impaired or unable to perform certain activities of daily living.\n7\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nNursing home indemnity LTC policies provide a predefined daily benefit if the insured is confined to a nursing home, subject to various maximum benefit periods, regardless of actual expenses of the policyholder. Our older generation nursing home indemnity LTC policies were primarily written between 1989 through 1999 and represent nearly one half of our policies. \nComprehensive reimbursement LTC policies provide a predefined maximum daily benefit if the insured is confined to a nursing home and covers a variety of LTC expenses, including assisted living, home and community care, adult day care and similar placement programs, subject to various maximum total benefit payment pools, on a cost-reimbursement basis. Our second-generation comprehensive reimbursement LTC policies were written from 1997 until 2002. \nOur closed block of LTC policies was sold on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in force policies, subject to regulatory approval. Premium rates for LTC policies vary by age, benefit period, elimination period, home care coverage and benefit increase option. Premium rates are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience. In line with the market, we have pursued nationwide premium rate increases for many years and expect to continue to pursue rate increases over the next several years. In general, since very little of our LTC business is subject to rate stability regulation, we have historically followed a policy of pursuing smaller, more frequent increases in order to align policyholder and historic shareholder objectives but modified our approach in 2019 to seek larger increases as an additional method to manage our LTC business. We also provide policyholders with options to reduce their coverage to lessen or eliminate the additional financial outlay that would otherwise result. \nFor existing LTC policies, RiverSource Life has continued ceding 50% of the risk on a coinsurance basis to subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. (“Genworth”) and retains the remaining risk. For RiverSource Life of NY, this reinsurance arrangement applies for 1996 and later issues only. Under these agreements, we have the right, but never the obligation, to recapture some, or all, of the risk ceded to Genworth.\nFor more information regarding LTC, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Corporate & Other” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nClosed Block Fixed Annuities \nIn 2020, we discontinued new sales of fixed annuities and moved the Fixed Annuities and Fixed Indexed Annuities blocks to the Corporate & Other segment as a closed block. In this closed block, as of December 31, 2024, we have $5.7 billion of account value associated with our fixed annuities of which 89% has been ceded by RiverSource Life on a coinsurance basis to Global Atlantic Financial Group’s subsidiary Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (“Commonwealth”) under customary reinsurance arrangements with a comfort trust. For the ceded policies, RiverSource Life ceded 100% of the risk on a coinsurance basis. \nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive global industry. As a diversified financial services firm, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, including registered investment advisers, securities brokers, asset managers, banks and insurance companies. We directly compete for the provision of products and services to clients, as well as for our financial advisors and investment management personnel. Certain of our competitors offer web-based or mobile-based financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients, and we increasingly compete with various financial technology companies.\nOur Advice & Wealth Management segment competes with securities broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, financial planning firms, registered investment advisers, insurance companies and other banks and financial institutions to attract and retain financial advisors and clients. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain financial advisors include compensation structures, brand recognition and reputation, product offerings and innovation, growth opportunities, and technology and service capabilities and support. Further, our financial advisors compete for clients with a range of other advisors, broker-dealers and direct channels. This includes wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, insurers, banks, asset managers, registered investment advisers and direct distributors. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain clients include quality of advice provided, price, reputation, advertising and brand recognition, product offerings, technology offerings for clients and advisors and service quality.\nOur Asset Management segment competes on a global basis against a substantial number of firms to acquire and retain managed and administered assets, including firms in the categories listed above. Competitive factors influencing our performance in this industry include investment performance, product offerings and innovation, product ratings, fee structures, advertising, technology and service quality, brand recognition, reputation and the ability to attract and retain investment personnel. Furthermore, changes in investment preferences or investment management strategy (for example, “active” or “passive” investing styles), client interest in funds with particular environmental, social, or governance practices, client or regulatory requirements on use of client commissions for research, and downward pressure on fees may present various challenges to our business and could cause clients to favor certain competitors. The impact of these factors on our business may vary from country to country and certain competitors may have competitive advantage in certain jurisdictions. \nCompetitors of our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment consist of both stock and mutual insurance companies. Competitive factors affecting the sale of variable annuity and insurance products include distribution capabilities, price, product features and innovation, hedging capability, investment performance, commission structure, reinsurance availability and pricing, perceived \n8\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nfinancial strength and financial strength ratings, claims-paying ratings, technology and service, advertising, brand recognition and financial strength ratings from rating agencies.\nHuman Capital Management\nAmeriprise Financial has a strong values-driven and inclusive culture that is the foundation of all that we do. While our individual business lines serve different client needs, we have a common vision and values that drive our business and how we work with clients and each other. \nOur values are the following:\n•\nClient focused;\n•\nIntegrity always;\n•\nExcellence in all we do; and\n•\nRespect for the individuals and for the communities in which we live and work.\nTo ensure our long-term success, we must continue to attract, retain, engage and develop a high-performing workforce. We are committed to providing an excellent employee and advisor experience for our global workforce. This includes approximately 13,600 employees, including our corporate employees and employee financial advisors. We have approximately 8,200 non-employee advisors who choose to affiliate with us through our franchise advisor group. \nLeadership skills and development of all our employees are core to our culture and history. We continue to invest in the development of our leaders and employees with a comprehensive and modern learning strategy to help them grow and achieve their career potential at Ameriprise. We work closely with leaders to prioritize organizational stewardship, leadership excellence and operating effectiveness as we executed our business plans.\nWe continually invest in our human capital programs and capabilities to ensure a highly competitive employee value proposition. We seek to offer a comprehensive and competitive total rewards program that supports our employees in their overall financial and personal health and well-being. Our total rewards programs are designed to attract, retain, and motivate employees and align their pay outcomes to the achievement of the organization and business unit results, in addition to their individual performance. Weighing both individual goal achievement (the “what”) and leadership performance (the “how”) is critical to driving strong business results. We have a competitive total compensation approach that includes base salary, annual cash awards and long-term incentives, as well as a comprehensive benefits strategy for employees that focuses on physical, social, emotional and financial wellness. We have enhanced our employee value proposition and framework so that current and prospective employees better understand and appreciate the investments we make in them, including our culture, compensation and benefits, well-being, work environment and career development.\nOur Board of Directors engages in these topics and annually reviews our senior executive succession plans and broader talent development approach in support of our corporate strategy, and frequently discusses human capital topics at its meetings. The Board and the Compensation and Benefits Committee are regularly updated on topics impacting our workforce and dedicate time to reviewing and discussing our company culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, and engagement survey feedback.\nIn 2024, our strong corporate culture yielded the following results:\n•\nOur overall employee engagement remains strong at 84% favorable - exceeding external benchmarks with key strengths in the categories of integrity, leader effectiveness, respect, and client focus. Consistent with prior years, we had strong input with 93% of employees participating in the survey.\n•\nWe prioritize professional development, and in 2024, we introduced an enhanced learning curriculum to support leadership excellence across the firm. Over 90% of our global people leaders participated in these leadership development programs. In addition, we invested in a comprehensive modern learning platform for all employees to ensure they have access to relevant curriculum to help support their growth and career development, while still prioritizing our annual compliance training. \n•\nIn addition to recruiting talented professionals to join Ameriprise, we retained 95% of our high-performing employees. \n•\nWithin our advisor force, the retention rate among affiliated advisors who have been with us for more than 10 years remained strong at 94%. \n•\nWe have also continued to attract experienced, productive advisors, with 278 experienced advisors moving their practices to Ameriprise in 2024 and approximately 1,691 over the last 5 years.\nOur vision is to continue to foster an inclusive culture where everyone at Ameriprise can belong, grow and contribute to realize their potential and deliver value for our clients, community and shareholders. We ensure employees and advisors understand the goals and needs of our diverse client base and deliver on our value proposition to meet those needs. And we provide the tools, resources and leadership to support them. Our global workforce is comprised of 40% women and, among our U.S. based employees, 22% are ethnically diverse. In our Inclusion Index from our employee engagement survey, we achieved a score of 84% in 2024, which exceeds the industry benchmark.  \n9\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nOur focus on fostering an inclusive culture is also reflected in the policies and practices that promote a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace. Our 13 global business resource networks, with over 23,000 employee engagements, are open to everyone and provide opportunities for connection, community and career development, supporting business growth.\nIn an evolving and highly competitive industry, we have continued to successfully execute on our strategy while delivering solid performance, reflecting the strength and resiliency of our values-based, inclusive culture and the effectiveness of our human capital strategy.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, and patent registrations and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. In the U.S. and other jurisdictions, we have established and registered, or filed applications to register, certain trademarks and service marks that we consider important to the marketing of our products and services, including but not limited to the \nAmeriprise Financial, Threadneedle, RiverSource, Columbia Threadneedle and Columbia Threadneedle Investments \nbrands. \nEnterprise Risk Management\nEnterprise risk management and our risk management program is an important component in how we manage our business. All operating subsidiaries of Ameriprise must comply with our enterprise risk management policy and framework, which: (i) establishes a structure for effective enterprise risk management, including oversight and governance; (ii) delineates key constituent roles and responsibilities; and (iii) imposes a number of core risk management processes. The enterprise risk management policy is designed to manage risks that may impact Ameriprise, including capital, credit, market, liquidity, operational, strategic, reputational, legal and compliance, and product. The enterprise risk management policy is supported by underlying risk policies at business units that provide further detail on the business unit’s risk governance, appetite, and tolerance. \nRegulation\nVirtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of our parent company and subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations provide broad regulatory, administrative and enforcement powers to supervisory agencies and other bodies, including U.S. federal and state regulatory and law enforcement agencies, foreign government agencies or regulatory bodies and U.S. and foreign securities exchanges. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations are significant and increasing, and the consequences for failing to comply may include civil or criminal charges, fines, censure, the suspension of individual employees, restrictions on or prohibitions from engaging in certain lines of business (or in certain states or countries), revocation of certain registrations and reputational damage. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our compliance and supervision processes, enhancing policies, procedures and oversight to monitor our compliance with the many legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business.\nWe operate in a highly scrutinized regulatory environment that remains subject to change. Regulatory developments, both in and outside of the U.S., have resulted or are expected to result in greater regulatory oversight and internal compliance obligations for firms across the financial services industry. We expect the current U.S. administration will seek to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different from that of the previous administration, impacting the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities of the federal regulators and agencies. In addition, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing and fiduciary initiatives, as well as environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) consideration and responsible investing; cybersecurity and resilience; the use of artificial intelligence; responsible information and data collection, storage and use; financial crime prevention; and privacy matters, and we will continue to closely review and monitor any legislative or regulatory proposals and changes. For example, the enacted European Union (“EU”) Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Act and proposed U.S. laws on AI are likely to influence how financial services firms design, build and deploy products and services incorporating AI, and process non-personal data. States in the U.S. and jurisdictions outside the U.S. continue to add new complexity to the patchwork of laws and regulations already in existence relating to privacy, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and other areas, and we expect this to continue at the federal and state level. Similar complexity resulting from multiple standards exists for retirement investing where individual states and federal regulators continue to propose or enact their own rules. These legal and regulatory changes have impacted and may in the future impact how we are regulated and how we operate and govern our businesses.\nThe discussion and overview set forth below provides a general framework of the primary laws and regulations impacting our businesses. Certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to one or more elements of this regulatory framework depending on the nature of their business, the products and services they provide and the geographic locations in which they operate. To the extent the discussion includes references to statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to these statutory and regulatory provisions and is current only as of the date of this report.\n10\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nAdvice & Wealth Management Regulation\nCertain of our subsidiaries are registered with the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and with certain states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also members of self-regulatory organizations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), and are subject to the regulations of these organizations. The SEC and FINRA have stringent rules with respect to the net capital requirements (which includes rules around customer protection) and the marketing and trading activities of broker-dealers. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as our financial advisors and other personnel, must obtain all required state and FINRA licenses and registrations to engage in the securities business and take certain steps to maintain such registrations in good standing. SEC regulations also impose notice requirements and capital limitations on the payment of dividends by a broker-dealer to a parent, and they have proposed regulations regarding cybersecurity programs and the public reporting of incidents impacting broker-dealers like ours.\n11\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nOur financial advisors are representatives of a dual registrant, meaning it is registered both as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and as a broker-dealer. Our advisors are subject to various regulations that impact how they operate their practices, including those related to supervision, sales methods, trading practices, information security, record-keeping and financial reporting. In addition, because our independent contractor advisor platform is structured as a franchise system, we are also subject to Federal Trade Commission and state franchise requirements. We continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding investing and financial advisors, including proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussions around transparency and disclosure in advisor compensation and recruiting, identifying and managing conflicts of interest and enhanced data collection.\nThe SEC’s Regulation Best Interest standard of care became effective June 30, 2020 and the SEC continues to issue various statements and other guidance on complying with the regulation. Furthermore, several states have either issued their own best interest or fiduciary rules or are considering doing so and those rules may be limited to certain types of products (e.g., insurance and annuities, financial planning, etc.) or may broadly cover all recommendations made by financial advisors. The U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”) finalized its voluntary exemption for providing investment advice to retirement account clients and has reinstated prior guidance for determining who is an investment advice fiduciary under pension regulations. The DOL finalized a new regulation expanding the definition of investment advice fiduciary, but that regulation has been stayed by the courts. While not a regulator, the Certified Financial Planner Board professional standards of conduct includes a fiduciary standard that applies to financial advisors who hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. Considering the various fiduciary rules and regulations that continue to be proposed, finalized, and sometimes withdrawn or amended, we continue to exert significant efforts to evaluate and prepare to comply with each rule. \nOther agencies, exchanges and self-regulatory organizations of which certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are members, and subject to applicable rules and regulations of, include the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”). Certain subsidiaries may also be registered as insurance agencies and may be subject to the regulations described in the following sections.\nAsset Management Regulation\nU.S. Regulation\nCertain of our asset management subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act and are subject to regulation by the SEC. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record-keeping, and operational and marketing restrictions. Our registered investment advisers may also be subject to certain obligations of the Investment Company Act based on their status as investment advisers to U.S. registered investment companies that we, or third parties, sponsor. As noted earlier, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services in the U.S. through rules, regulatory priorities or general discussion. This trend is especially true globally where regulators remain active, including in Europe. Any future regulation could potentially require new approaches which increase our regulatory burdens and costs.\nMany aspects of the regulation that applies to our Advice & Wealth Management segment also apply to our Asset Management segment. For example, Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, is registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and distributor for \nColumbia Management\n funds and other products. Additionally, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), the SEC’s best interest standards, state and other fiduciary or best interest rules, as well as other similar standards and any rulemaking from the DOL would be relevant to our global asset management business. We continue to review and analyze the potential impact of these regulations across each of our business lines.\nIn addition, certain of our asset management subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as a commodity trading advisor and commodity pool operator and are also members of the NFA. In this regard, we are subject to additional registration and reporting requirements with respect to certain registered investment companies and other pooled vehicles that use or trade in futures, swaps and other derivatives that are subject to CFTC regulation.\nU.K. Regulation\nOutside of the U.S., Columbia Threadneedle is authorized to conduct its financial services business in the U.K. under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. A number of legal entities in the\n Columbia Threadneedle\n business are currently regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and one entity in the \nColumbia Threadneedle\n business is also regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”). FCA and PRA rules impose certain capital, operational and compliance requirements and allow for disciplinary action in the event of noncompliance. As with the U.S. regulatory environment, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services. Key U.K. regulatory developments and trends include the following:\n•\nOperational Resilience:\n Under this new U.K. regulatory requirement, in scope firms must identify their important business services, which, if unavailable, could cause intolerable harm to clients, which they could not reasonably recover, or market disruption. The regulations introduce a new concept of impact tolerance and firms are also required to stress test their important business services and appoint a senior manager accountable for the regime.\n12\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\n•\nFinancial Resilience:\n U.K. regulators have revised the prudential regime applying to asset managers. This is being phased in over a five-year period and introduces a number of new capital requirements.\n•\nFCA Consumer Duty:\n The FCA recently introduced a new Consumer Duty that sets higher expectations for the standard of care that firms provide to retail consumers.\n•\nSustainability Disclosure Requirements\n: The FCA recently finalized new requirements that have started to take effect relating to new sustainability product labels, naming and marketing rules, additional ESG disclosure requirements both at an entity and product level, and an anti-greenwashing rule covering client communications.\n•\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n: The FCA recently launched a consultation on a potential new regulatory framework on diversity and inclusion in the financial sector. The consultation also incorporated additional proposed rules around firms’ handling of non-financial misconduct in the context of adherence to the FCA’s conduct and fitness and propriety regimes.\nOur U.K. asset management business must comply with local EU and country requirements as a non-EU firm, which includes leveraging our various EU-based affiliated entities (such as those in Luxembourg and the Netherlands) to provide services and marketing to EU clients and investors. We have an established fund range domiciled in Luxembourg (both UCITS and Alternative Investment Funds), Ireland and the Netherlands, along with Luxembourg-based and Netherlands-based affiliated management companies. Our Luxembourg and Netherlands affiliates may perform fund management, administration and distribution functions. Therefore, we are well placed to continue to serve investors in the EU. \nPan-European and Other Non-U.S. Regulation\nIn addition to the above, certain of our asset management subsidiaries and branches are required to comply with pan-European directives as issued by the European Commission and adopted by EU member states. Certain of these directives have impacted and will continue to impact our global asset management business. For example, certain of our asset management subsidiaries are required to comply with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”), UCITS, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (“SFDR”) and the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products Regulation (“PRIIPs”).  These requirements impact the way we manage assets and place, settle and report on trades for our clients, as well as market to clients and prospects. Similar to the developments in the U.S., we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services through international markets, including in the U.K. and EU where we have a substantial asset management business. These international rules, proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussions may impact us directly or indirectly, including as a regulated entity or as a service provider to, or a business receiving services from or engaging in transactions with, regulated entities. In addition to regulations noted in this section, within the EU and the U.K. we have been and will continue to address regulatory reforms or structural changes including but not limited to: Consumer Composite Investments, Retail Investment Strategy, AIFMD 2.0,\n \nEMIR 3.0\n,\n SFDR 2.0, Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”). In addition , although the U.K. is not a part of the EU, the U.K. regulators may choose to implement future EU regulations and apply them in the U.K. potentially with significant variation from the EU regulations and potentially increasing the complexity and costs for our compliance with divergent sets of rules.\nColumbia Threadneedle \ncompanies or activities are also subject to various local country or jurisdiction regulations and to corresponding regulators in Europe, Canada, Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore, South America and Australia. With our growth in the EU, we have (and will continue to have) greater engagement with the Luxembourg, Irish and Dutch regulators. \nOther Securities Regulation\nACC is regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. As a registered investment company, ACC must observe certain governance, disclosure, record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements. Ameriprise Certificate Company pays dividends to the parent company and is subject to capital requirements under applicable law and understandings with the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce (“MN DOC”) (Banking Division).\nATC is primarily regulated by the MN DOC (Banking Division) and is subject to capital adequacy requirements under Minnesota law. It is prohibited from accepting deposits or making personal or commercial loans. As a provider of products and services to tax-qualified retirement plans and IRAs, certain aspects of our business, including the activities of our trust company, fall within the compliance oversight of the DOL and the Department of Treasury, particularly regarding the enforcement of ERISA, and the tax reporting requirements applicable to such accounts. ATC, as well as our investment adviser subsidiaries, may be subject to ERISA, and the regulations thereunder, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to certain ERISA clients.\nInsurance Regulation\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by states and other territories where they are domiciled or otherwise licensed to do business. These regulations impact our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment and our closed blocks included in Corporate & Other segment. The primary purpose of this regulation and supervision is to protect the interests of contractholders and policyholders. In general, state insurance laws and regulations govern standards of solvency, capital requirements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, premium rates, policy forms, the nature of and limitations on investments, periodic reporting requirements and other matters. In addition, state regulators conduct periodic examinations into insurer market conduct and \n13\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\ncompliance with insurance and securities laws. RiverSource Life Insurance Company is domiciled in Minnesota and regulated by the MN DOC and RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York is domiciled in New York and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NY DFS”), and together with MN DOC are the “Domiciliary Regulators”. In addition to being regulated by their Domiciliary Regulators, our RiverSource Life companies are regulated by each of the insurance regulators in the states where each is authorized to transact business. Financial regulation of our RiverSource Life companies is extensive, and their financial transactions (such as intercompany dividends and investment activity) may be subject to pre-approval and/or continuing evaluation by the Domiciliary Regulators.\nAspects of the regulation applicable to our Advice & Wealth Management segment also apply to our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment and the closed blocks in our Corporate & Other segment. For example, RiverSource Distributors, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, is registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and/or distributor for our \nRiverSource\n annuities and insurance products sold through Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (“AFS”), a wholly owned subsidiary, and third-party channels. Additionally, ERISA, the SEC’s best interest standards, state and other fiduciary or best interest rules, as well as other similar standards and any rulemaking from the DOL are relevant to our insurance and annuities business or products. We continue to review and analyze the potential impact of these regulations across each of our business lines.\nAll states require participation in insurance guaranty associations, which assess fees (subject to statutory limits) to insurance companies in order to fund claims of policyholders and contractholders of insolvent insurance companies. These assessments are generally based on a member insurer’s proportionate share of all premiums written by member insurers in the state during a specified period prior to an insurer’s insolvency. See Note 26 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding guaranty association assessments.\nCertain variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts offered by the RiverSource Life companies, and certain separate accounts supporting such contracts, constitute and are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933 and as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. As such, these products are subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. \nThe Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the U.S. Department of Treasury does not have substantive regulatory responsibilities, though it is tasked with monitoring the insurance industry and the effectiveness of its regulatory framework in addition to providing periodic reports to the President of the U.S. and Congress. We monitor the FIO’s activity to identify and assess emerging regulatory priorities with potential application to our business.\nEach of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements designed to assess the adequacy of an insurance company’s total adjusted capital in relation to its investment, insurance and other risks. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has established RBC standards that all state insurance departments have adopted. The RBC requirements are used by the NAIC and state insurance regulators to identify companies that merit regulatory actions designed to protect policyholders. The NAIC RBC report is completed as of December 31 and filed annually, along with the statutory financial statements. \nOur RiverSource Life companies would be subject to various levels of regulatory intervention if their total adjusted statutory capital falls below defined RBC action levels. At the “company action level,” defined as total adjusted capital level between 100% and 75% of the RBC requirement, an insurer must submit a plan for corrective action with its primary state regulator. The level of regulatory intervention is greater at lower levels of total adjusted capital relative to the RBC requirement. \nRiverSource Life and RiverSource Life of NY maintain capital levels well in excess of the company action level required by state insurance regulators as noted below as of December 31, 2024:\nEntity\nCompany Action Level RBC\nTotal Adjusted Capital\n% of Company Action Level RBC\n(in millions, except percentages)\nRiverSource Life\n$\n489 \n$\n2,700 \n552 \n%\nRiverSource Life of NY\n38 \n219 \n579 \n%\nAmeriprise Financial, as a direct and indirect owner of its insurance subsidiaries, is subject to the insurance holding company laws of Minnesota and New York (the states where its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled). These laws generally require insurance holding companies to register with the insurance department of the insurance company’s state of domicile and to provide certain financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company structure.\nAs part of its Solvency Modernization Initiative, in 2010 the NAIC adopted revisions to its Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (“Holding Company Act”) to enhance insurer group supervision and create a new Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act. The Holding Company Act revisions focus on the overall insurance holding company system, establish a framework of regulator supervisory colleges, enhancements to corporate governance, and require the annual filing of an Enterprise Risk Management Report. The ORSA Model Act requires that an insurer create and file, annually, its ORSA, which is a complete self-assessment of its risk management functions and capital adequacy. These laws were enacted by the  \n14\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nDomiciliary Regulators. We complete and file these reports as required by the laws and regulations of those states. Insurance regulation and supervision also goes beyond direct regulation of our insurance companies in other ways.  For example, while we are now subject to the FRB’s “Building Block Approach” (discussed below in more detail), once Minnesota implements the NAIC’s “Group Capital Calculation,” a new capital calculation will exist for many insurance companies like ours that are not subject to the FRB regulation as we are. And from time to time, we must report other enterprise activities to our state insurance regulators (such as the NAIC’s Liquidity Stress Testing Framework).\nFederal Banking and Financial Holding Company Regulation\nAmeriprise Bank is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), which is the primary regulator of federal savings banks, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) in its role as insurer of Ameriprise Bank's deposits. As a federally chartered savings bank, Ameriprise Bank is subject to numerous rules and regulations governing all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices and transactions with affiliates. Ameriprise Bank is also subject to specific capital rules and limits on capital distributions, including payment of dividends. If Ameriprise Bank's capital falls below certain levels, the OCC would be required to take remedial actions and could take other actions, including imposing further limits on dividends or business activities. In addition, an array of Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), fair lending and other consumer protection laws and regulations apply to Ameriprise Bank. \nAs the controlling company of Ameriprise Bank, Ameriprise Financial is a savings and loan holding company that is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB. Ameriprise Financial has elected to be classified as a financial holding company subject to applicable regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “Bank Holding Company Act”). Further, FRB regulation and supervisory oversight of Ameriprise Financial includes examinations, regular financial reporting, and prudential standards, such as capital, liquidity risk management, and parameters for business conduct and internal governance.\nUnder the Bank Holding Company Act, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking, and going beyond these activities would require a conformance period request from the FRB. As a financial holding company, we may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. We may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of either a bank holding company (or a bank) without the prior approval of the FRB or of a non-financial company absent an available exemption.\nIn order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, Ameriprise Bank, as our sole insured depository institution subsidiary, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” under applicable regulations, and must receive at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the CRA. In addition, Ameriprise, as a financial holding company, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the violation and any agreement then reached with the FRB, Ameriprise Financial could not undertake new activities, continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those generally permissible for bank holding companies until such violation is cured.\nWe are subject to what is commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits “banking entities,” including Ameriprise and our affiliates, from engaging in certain “proprietary trading” activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, asset management, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with “covered funds,” with a number of exemptions and exclusions. It also requires banking entities to have comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule.\nAmeriprise Financial reports to the FRB under a consolidated capital framework termed the “Building Block Approach” (“BBA”) for savings and loan holding companies that are significantly engaged in insurance activities (commonly referred to as insurance savings and loan holding companies). In general, under the rule, insurance savings and loan holding companies like us are required to aggregate state-based insurance capital requirements with banking capital requirements for non-insurance businesses to satisfy specific minimum total requirements and hold an additional capital conservation buffer. The ratio of the amount of available capital to the capital requirement amount is referred to as the BBA ratio and is subject to a 250% minimum, effective January 1, 2024. An additional capital conservation buffer of 150% will be effective as of December 31, 2025, for a total capital requirement of at least 400%.\nThe BBA available capital, BBA capital requirement, and BBA ratio as of December 31, 2024  are as follows:\n(in millions, except percentages)\nBBA available capital\n$\n3,833 \nBBA capital requirement\n392 \nBBA ratio\n978 \n%\n15\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nAdditional Parent Company Regulation and Other Regulation\nWe are a publicly traded company subject to SEC and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) rules and regulation and have operations in a number of geographical regions across the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Certain states enact regulations or requirements that can drive enterprise-wide action or disclosures. We evaluate these laws and changes to understand if and when they impact our business, such as the laws in California requiring certain climate-related disclosure. As an international company, we continuously monitor developments in EU legislation, as well as in the other markets in which we operate, to ensure that we comply with all applicable legal requirements, including EU directives applicable to financial institutions as implemented in the various member states. Because of the mix of business activities we conduct, we assess the impact of, and monitor our status under, the EU Financial Conglomerates Directive, which contemplates global supervision and prudential regulation of certain financial conglomerates involved in banking, insurance and investment activities. \nPrivacy, Environmental and Anti-Money Laundering Laws \nMany aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive legal requirements concerning the use and protection of personal information, including client and employee information, from a multitude of different functional regulators and law enforcement bodies. This includes rules adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act, an ever increasing number of state laws and regulations such as the NY DFS’ Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, and California privacy legislation, as recently amended, EU data protection legislation, known as the Global Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), as implemented in the respective EU member states, the U.K. Data Protection Act, 2018 and U.K. GDPR, and data protection rules in other regions in which we operate outside the U.S. and the EU. We have also implemented policies and procedures in response to such requirements. We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in accordance with applicable laws and our internal data protection policies, including taking steps to reduce the potential for identity theft or other improper use or disclosure of personal information, while seeking to collect only the data that is necessary to properly achieve our business objectives and best serve our clients. To the extent we do experience an incident, we have developed and implemented a cybersecurity incident response manual, which we regularly exercise and update, as appropriate.\nAs the owner and operator of real property, we are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. We periodically conduct certain air and water reviews on our own real estate as well as investment real estate to assess and support our compliance with these laws and regulations.\nThe Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the USA Patriot Act, was enacted in October 2001. It substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the U.S. In response, we enhanced our existing anti-money laundering programs and developed new procedures and programs, including enhancing our “know your customer” and “due diligence” programs. We continuously review, update and enhance our anti-money laundering procedures and programs. In addition, we will continue to comply with anti-money laundering legislation in the U.K. derived from applicable EU directives and international initiatives adopted in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nExchange Act Reports and Additional Information\nWe maintain an Investor Relations website at ir.ameriprise.com. Investors can also access the website through our main website at ameriprise.com by clicking on the “Investor Relations” link located at the bottom of our homepage (ameriprise.com). We use our Investor Relations website to announce financial and other information to investors and to make available SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, other communications and webcasts. Investors and others interested in the Company are encouraged to visit the Investor Relations website from time to time, as information is frequently updated and posted. Additionally, users can sign up to receive automatic notifications when new materials are posted. The information found on the website is not incorporated by reference into this report or in any other report or document we furnish or file with the SEC.",
    "item1a": "Item 1A.  Risk Factors  \nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. We believe that the following information identifies the material factors affecting our company based on the information we currently know. However, the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nMarket Risks\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and by economic, political and other factors.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic and other factors (whether actual or perceived). Such factors, which can be global, regional, national or local in nature, include: (i) the level and \n16\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nvolatility of the markets, including equity prices, interest rates, commodity prices, currency values and other market indices and drivers; (ii) geopolitical strain, terrorism and armed conflicts, (iii) political dynamics or elections and social, economic and market conditions; (iv) the availability and cost of capital; (v) global health emergencies; (vi) technological changes and events; (vii) U.S. and foreign government fiscal and tax policies; (viii) U.S. and foreign government ability, real or perceived, to avoid defaulting on government securities; (ix) the availability and cost of credit and hedge markets; (x) periods of elevated inflation; (xi) natural disasters such as weather catastrophes; and (xii) other factors affecting investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets. Furthermore, changes in consumer economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, decreases in property values, and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, may substantially affect consumer financials, which, in turn, could impact client activity in all of our businesses. These factors also may have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives or to pay dividends or otherwise return capital from our subsidiaries to our holding company.\nDeclines and volatility in U.S. and global market conditions have impacted our businesses in the past, are impacting us now and may continue to impact us in the same, new or different ways in the future. Our businesses have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by U.S. and global capital market and credit crises, the repricing of credit risk, equity market volatility and decline, and stress or recession in the U.S. and global economies generally. Each of our segments operates in these markets with exposure for us and our clients in securities, loans, derivatives, alternative investments, seed capital and other commitments. It is difficult to predict when, how long and to what extent the aforementioned adverse conditions will exist, which of our markets, products and businesses will be directly affected and to what extent our clients may seek to bring claims arising out of investment performance that is affected by these conditions. As a result, these factors could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThese factors will also impact client behavior. Market downturns, stagnation, and volatility may cause, and have caused, individual investors to limit or decrease their participation in global markets negatively impacting our retail business and/or our product sales. Market conditions, regulatory actions, tax laws, and our competitive industry environment are among the reasons current shareholders in our mutual funds, closed-end funds, exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), hedge funds, OEICs, SICAVs, unit trusts, investment trusts and other pooled investment vehicles, contractholders in our annuity products and policyholders in our protection products may opt to withdraw cash values for those products (or for certain protection products, to reduce their withdrawal activity). If we are unable to offer appropriate product alternatives which encourage clients to continue purchasing in the face of actual or perceived market volatility, our sales and management fee revenues could decline. \nDownturns and volatility in markets or the departure of a key client have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our asset management services, retail advisory accounts, variable annuity contracts, banking products and other products. Because the profitability of these products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, declines in the markets will reduce our revenues because the value of the investment assets we manage will be reduced. In addition, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from investment management agreements with the Columbia Management family of mutual funds or other investment managers which are terminable on 60 days’ notice. Although some contracts governing investment management services are subject to termination for failure to meet performance benchmarks, institutional and individual clients can generally terminate their relationships with us or our financial advisors at will or on relatively short notice. Further, a number of the products and services we make available to our clients are those offered by third parties and negative perceptions of these financial products and services (or the financial industry in general) may impact the number of withdrawals and redemptions or reduce purchases made by our clients, which would adversely impact the levels of our assets under management. Our clients can also reduce the aggregate amount of managed assets or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different fee rate structures, for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences or investment management strategy (for example, “active” or “passive” investing styles or the proliferation of ETFs or other vehicles like separately managed accounts (“SMAs”)), changes in our (or our advisors’) reputation in the marketplace, a client’s view of ESG factors, changes in client or relationship management, loss of key investment management personnel and financial market performance. This reduction in managed assets or significant redemptions, and the associated decrease in revenues and earnings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly in products or services where we have less scale and a reduction in managed assets can make the product not viable or even require us to exit the product. \nMost of our variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits and a majority of our variable annuity products in force contain guaranteed minimum withdrawal and accumulation benefits. Decline or volatility in equity and/or bond markets could result in guaranteed minimum benefits being higher than what current account values would support, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Discontinuing the sale of new fixed annuities and variable annuities with living benefits will lessen this risk over time. Although we have hedged a portion of the guarantees for the variable annuity contracts to mitigate the financial loss of equity and/or bond market declines or volatility, there can be no assurance that such a decline or volatility would not materially impact the profitability of certain products or product lines or our financial condition or results of operations. For example, market fluctuations will impact our statutory reserves and required capital, and that may not be aligned with the hedging impacts. In addition to risks from guarantees discussed above, structured variable annuity contracts contain index-linked risks that adjust the policyholder’s or contractholder’s account value based on equity movements. These risks are hedged with derivatives, which are a material component of our overall hedging program. Collateral requirements for the hedging program are market-sensitive, and certain market environments (e.g., rising interest rates) will result in increased needs for liquidity to satisfy these requirements. Depending on \n17\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nhow rapidly the market moves and other factors, we may need to access liquidity sources that are more costly, which could have an adverse impact on profitability or our results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our insurance, annuity, investment products, wrap fees and banking products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations (inclusive of changes in credit spreads), which could cause future impacts associated with such fluctuations to differ from our historical results of operations. In addition, interest rate fluctuations could result in fluctuations in the valuation of certain minimum guaranteed benefits contained in some of our variable annuity products. Although we typically hedge to mitigate some of the effect of such fluctuations, significant changes in interest rates (or prolonged periods of low interest rates) could have a material adverse impact on the profitability of certain products or product lines or our results of operations or financial condition. \nInterest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio. During periods of declining market interest rates or stagnancy of low interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases and we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of certain callable fixed income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which increases the risk that we may have to reinvest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower-yielding or lower-credit instruments.\nIf there is a return to a period of prolonged low interest rates, our spread may be reduced or could become negative. Due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our businesses, such as long term care and universal life with secondary guarantees as well as guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in or stagnancy of low long-term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. We periodically review and, where appropriate, adjust our assumptions.\nAs market interest rates increase or sustain at relatively higher rates, we may credit clients higher rates on interest-sensitive products, such as universal life insurance, face-amount certificates, and banking products and we may increase these rates on in force products to keep these products competitive (which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations). Because yields on invested assets may not increase as quickly as current interest rates, we may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, increases in market interest rates would further increase the unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and may cause outflows and other negative impacts through increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans, or changes in demands of certain bank or certificate products as policyholders, contractholders and clients seek to shift assets to products with perceived higher returns. This process may lead to an earlier than expected outflow of cash from many different areas of our business. These withdrawals, surrenders and other client actions may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in investment losses to be realized in our results of operations. Also, increases in market interest rates may result in extension of certain cash flows from structured mortgage assets. An increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals also may require us to accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) or other intangibles or cause an impairment of goodwill, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings in the period. If higher market interest rates lead to inflows into interest-sensitive products (such as face-amount certificates and certain banking products) or other changes in product behavior, our capital requirements may increase as well. \nAdverse capital and credit market conditions or a downgrade in our credit ratings may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital.\nVolatility, uncertainty and disruption in the capital and credit markets may decrease available liquidity, which we may need to pay our expenses and dividends. If the market conditions hinder our availability to obtain capital or liquidity, our business could suffer.\nOur liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through our reserves and the cash generated by our operations. We believe the level of cash and securities we maintain, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term payment obligations. In the event current resources are insufficient to satisfy our needs, we may access financing sources such as our committed unsecured revolving credit facility or other bank debt. Additional financing depends on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, actions by our regulators, and perceptions held by stakeholders, clients or lenders.\nFurther, the financial strength ratings which various rating organizations publish as a measure of an insurance company’s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintain public confidence in our products, our competitive position, and the ability to market our products. Any future downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or the announced or perceived  potential for a downgrade, could potentially have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRatings agencies have and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating organizations’ models for maintenance of ratings levels (including adjusting the framework under which they view our business mix that drives these requirements), or downgrade ratings applied to particular classes of securities or types of institutions, and our ratings could be changed at any time and without any notice by the rating organizations. In \n18\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\naddition, rating agencies continually evolve their ratings and other methodologies, and these changes can be to our detriment or benefit and have a material impact on how we view our liquidity and capital.\nMarket conditions or decisions by our ratings agencies that hinder our access to capital may limit our ability to satisfy statutory capital targets, generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of capital than we would otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.\nBusiness Risks \nIntense competition and the economies of scale for larger competitors could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.\nOur businesses operate in intensely competitive industries, including broker-dealers, banks, asset managers, insurers and other financial institutions, some of which have a larger market share, greater investments in technology and analytics, greater investment in advertising and brand, less regulation or greater financial resources than we do. Furthermore, our competitors may be better able to address trends, structural changes, or movement of assets resulting from industry changes or in response to the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S. and around the world. We could experience lower sales, higher costs, technology obsolescence or other developments that could negatively impact our results of operations. \nA drop in our investment performance as compared to that of our competitors could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nInvestment performance is a key competitive factor for our retail and institutional asset management products and services and is a key driver of growing assets under management and economies of scale. Strong investment performance supports the retention of our products and services by our clients and creates opportunities for new sales of products and services. It may also result in higher ratings by ratings services such as Morningstar or Lipper, which may compound the foregoing effects. \nThere can be no assurance as to how future investment performance will compare to our competitors or that historical performance will be indicative of future returns. Any drop or perceived drop in investment performance as compared to our competitors could cause a decline in sales of our investment products, an increase in redemptions and the termination of asset management relationships. These impacts may reduce our aggregate amount of assets under management and reduce management fees. Poor investment performance could also adversely affect our ability to expand the distribution of our products through unaffiliated third parties. Further, any drop in market share of mutual funds sales by our advisors or through third party intermediaries, may further reduce profits as sales of other companies’ mutual funds are less profitable than sales of our proprietary funds.\nWe face intense competition in attracting and retaining key talent.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract, motivate, engage and retain high-performing and high-potential talent in a highly competitive industry. Although the employment market is stabilizing compared to recent years, the financial services sector remains a highly competitive industry, especially for top talent. We proactively assess retention risks and invest in our employees to remain an employer of choice. Additionally, we have diversified our geographic footprint to attract and retain top talent globally, including expanding our workforce in India. \nWe are also dependent on our network of advisors to drive growth and results in our wealth management business (and for a significant portion of the sales of our products). Recruiting and retaining financial advisors is highly competitive and constantly evolving. The investment performance of our asset management products and services, as well as retention of our products and services by our clients, depend on the strategies and decisions of our portfolio managers and analysts. \nFrom time to time there are regulatory-driven or other trends and developments within the industry that could potentially impact the dynamics between us and our competitors or negatively impact our business. If employees or advisors who maintain relationships with our clients leave or retire without succession plans, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships, and our clients may choose to leave for a competitor. If we experience a prolonged inability to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nThe negative performance or default by other financial institutions or other third parties could adversely affect us. \nWe have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, insurers, reinsurers, investment funds and other institutions. The operations of U.S. and global financial services institutions are interconnected and a decline in the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions may expose us to credit losses or defaults, limit our access to liquidity or otherwise disrupt the operations of our businesses. While we regularly assess our exposure to different industries and counterparties, the performance and financial strength of specific institutions are subject to rapid change, the timing and extent of which cannot be known. \nMany transactions with and investments in the products and securities of other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. With respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we \n19\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nhold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. We also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions (including with respect to derivatives hedging our exposure on variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefits and structured variable annuities), reinsurance, repurchase and underwriting arrangements and equity investments. Any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIssuers of the fixed maturity securities that we own may default on principal and interest payments. Some of our fixed maturity securities may have ratings below investment-grade. Default-related declines in the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio or consumer credit holdings could cause our net earnings to decline and could also cause us to contribute capital to some of our regulated subsidiaries, which may require us to obtain funding during periods of unfavorable market conditions.\nCapital and credit market volatility or a sudden devaluation of a specific product or security (such as the broad impacts experienced from the 2023 regional bank crisis) can exacerbate, and has exacerbated, the risk of third-party defaults, bankruptcy filings, foreclosures, legal actions and other events that may limit the value of or restrict our access and our clients’ access to cash and investments. Although we are not required to do so, we have elected in the past, and we may elect in the future, to compensate clients for losses incurred in response to such events, provide clients with temporary credit or liquidity or other support related to products that we manage, or provide credit liquidity or other support to the financial products we manage. If we elect to provide additional support, we could incur losses from the support we provide and incur additional costs, including financing costs, in connection with the support. These losses and additional costs could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations. If we were to take such actions we may also restrict or otherwise utilize our corporate assets, limiting our flexibility to use these assets for other purposes, and may be required to raise additional capital.\nWe may not be able to maintain our unaffiliated third-party distribution channels and the sale of unaffiliated products may diminish sales of our own products.\nWe distribute many of our investment products through unaffiliated third-party advisors and financial institutions. Maintaining and deepening relationships with these unaffiliated distributors is an important part of our growth strategy, as strong third-party distribution arrangements enhance our ability to market our products or service our clients and to increase our assets under management, revenues and profitability. Access to distribution channels is subject to intense competition due to the large number of competitors and products in the investment advisory industry as well as regulatory and consumer trends driving escalating compliance, disclosure and risk management requirements for distributors. Relationships with our distributors are subject to periodic negotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of our products marketed.\nAs a result, there can be no assurance that the distribution relationships we have established will continue. Any such reduction in access to (or the economics associated with) third-party distributors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and to generate revenue in our Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management segments. Further, any increase in the costs to distribute our products or reduction in the type or amount of products made available for sale may have a material effect on our revenues and profitability.\nThe sale of third-party products to our clients (and further expansion of our advisor network’s product suite to include additional products of unaffiliated insurance companies and asset managers) may lower sales of our companies’ own products, lead to higher surrenders or redemptions, or other developments which might not be fully offset by higher distribution revenues or other benefits, possibly resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nFixed maturity, equity, trading securities and short-term investments, which are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent the majority of our total cash and invested assets. The determination of fair values by management in the absence of quoted market prices is based on valuation methodologies, securities we deem to be comparable, and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer, current interest rates and credit spreads, and quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates and rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities and the value of our securities as reported within our Consolidated Financial Statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. In such cases, the valuation of certain securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable and may require greater estimation as well as valuation methods that are more sophisticated, \n20\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nwhich may result in values less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances taken on certain loans and investments is subject to management’s evaluation and judgment and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of inherent and known risks associated with the respective asset class. \nManagement uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. The determination of the amount of allowances on loans is based upon the asset’s expected life, considering past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.  Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.\nSome of our investments are relatively illiquid and we may have difficulty selling these investments.\nWe invest a portion of our owned assets in certain privately placed fixed income securities, mortgage loans, and limited partnership interests, all of which are relatively illiquid. These asset classes represented 8% of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them for an amount less than we would otherwise have been able to realize, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance Risks\nIf the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements default or otherwise fail to fulfill their obligations, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use reinsurance to mitigate certain of our risks. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders and contractholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit and performance risk with respect to our reinsurers, including Commonwealth and Genworth Life Insurance Company. In July 2016, we finalized various confidential enhancements with Genworth Life Insurance Company that have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our Domiciliary Regulators and rating agencies. A reinsurer’s insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of our reinsurance agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure of other insurers could require us to pay higher assessments to state insurance guaranty funds.\nOur insurance companies are required by law to be members of the guaranty fund association in every state where they are licensed to do business. In the event of insolvency of one or more unaffiliated insurance companies, our insurance companies could be adversely affected by the requirement to pay assessments to the guaranty fund associations. Uncertainty and volatility in the U.S. economy and financial markets in recent years have weakened or may weaken the financial condition of numerous insurers, including insurers currently in receivership, increasing the risk of triggering guaranty fund assessments upon order of liquidation.\nIf our reserves for future policy benefits and claims or for future certificate redemptions and maturities are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe establish reserves as estimates of our liabilities to provide for future obligations under our insurance policies, annuities and investment certificate contracts. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability but, rather, are estimates of contract benefits and related expenses we expect to incur over time. The assumptions and estimates we make in establishing reserves require certain judgments about future experience and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the actual amounts that we will pay for contract benefits, the timing of payments, or whether the assets supporting our stated reserves will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of benefits or claims. We monitor our reserve levels continually. If we were to conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected contract benefits, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance profitability relies on our assumptions including those regarding morbidity rates, mortality rates and benefit utilization as well as the future persistency of our insurance policies and annuity contracts.\nWe set prices for insurance products as well as some annuity products based upon expected claims payment patterns, derived from assumptions we make about our policyholders and contractholders, including expenses, fees, investment returns, and morbidity and mortality rates. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions. Actual experience can differ from our assumptions for many reasons over the time an insurance product is held. If mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits than we have projected.\nThe prices and profitability of our life insurance and deferred annuity products are based in part upon assumptions related to persistency (the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next). For most of our life insurance \n21\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nand deferred annuity products, actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy or contract because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract.\nFor our LTC insurance, universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees and variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. If these policies remain in force longer than we assumed, we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced or partially reinsured these products.\nThe risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our pricing assumptions is particularly significant for our LTC insurance products notwithstanding our ability to implement future price increases with regulatory approvals. Though we discontinued offering LTC products in 2003, LTC insurance policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will continue to emerge over many years. Our ability to forecast future claim rates for LTC insurance is more limited than life insurance. We have sought to moderate these uncertainties to some extent by partially reinsuring LTC policies at the time the policies were underwritten and limiting our present stand-alone LTC insurance offerings to policies underwritten fully by unaffiliated third-party insurers, and we have also implemented rate increases and provided reduced benefit options on certain in force policies. \nBecause our assumptions regarding persistency experience are inherently uncertain, reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate if actual persistency experience is different from those assumptions. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract, we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability. Additionally, some of these pricing changes require regulatory approval, which may not be forthcoming. Moreover, many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract, while premiums on certain other products (primarily LTC insurance) may not be increased without prior regulatory approval. Significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations regarding persistency could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products.\nOperations Risks\nA failure to protect our reputation could adversely affect our businesses.\nOur reputation is one of our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain clients, investors, employees and advisors is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our company. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Reputational damage may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, any perceived or actual weakness in our financial strength or liquidity, clients’ or potential clients’ perceived failure of how we address certain political, environmental, social or governance topics, technological breakdowns, cybersecurity attacks, or other security breaches (including attempted breaches, breaches impacting our vendors or their subcontractors or inadvertent disclosures) resulting in system unavailability, improper disclosure or loss of data integrity relating to client or employee personal information, unethical or improper behavior and the misconduct or error of our employees, advisors and counterparties. Additionally, a failure to develop new products and services, or successfully manage associated operational risks, could harm our reputation and potentially expose us to additional costs, or negative public relations or social media campaigns. Any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental audits or investigations or litigation. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.\nMisconduct by our employees and advisors may be difficult to detect and deter and may damage our reputation. This can include improper use of their authorized access to sensitive information. Misconduct or errors by our employees and advisors could result in violations of law, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm. Misconduct or mistakes can occur in each of our businesses. We cannot always prevent misconduct by our employees and advisors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. We seek to aid our advisors and provide certain requirements and support to protect our non-employee franchise advisors’ technology solutions to run their businesses, but they control their own technology environment on a day-to-day basis and could have an adverse effect on our business. Our reputation depends on our continued identification of and mitigation against conflicts of interest. We have procedures and controls that are designed to identify, address and appropriately disclose perceived conflicts of interest, though our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to address conflicts of interest appropriately.\nIn addition, the SEC and other federal and state regulators, as well as foreign regulators, have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest and the actions we may be expected to take when a conflict is encountered. It is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. Also, it is possible that the regulatory scrutiny of, and litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest will make our clients less willing to enter into transactions with us or in certain products or services we offer, which would adversely affect our businesses.\n22\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nThe direct and indirect effects of climate change could adversely affect our business and operations, both directly and as a result of impacts on our clients, counterparties and entities whose securities we hold.  \nWe operate in many regions, countries and communities around the world where our business, and the activities of our clients and counterparties, could be adversely affected by climate change. Climate change may increase the severity and frequency of weather-related catastrophes, or adversely affect our investment portfolio or investor sentiment. This includes the potential for an increase in the frequency and severity of weather-related disasters and pandemics. In addition, climate change regulation may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities we hold, or our willingness to continue to hold their securities. Climate change may also influence investor sentiment with respect to the Company and investments in our portfolio and those available to clients through third parties. It may also impact other counterparties, including reinsurers, and affect the value of investments, including real estate investments we hold or manage for others. Climate risks can also arise from the inconsistencies and conflicts in the manner in which climate policy, disclosure requirements and financial regulation is implemented in the many regions where we operate, including initiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect. Transition risks may arise from societal adjustment to a lower-carbon economy, such as changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. These risks could also be influenced by changes in the physical climate. Overall, we cannot predict or estimate the long-term impacts on us from climate change or related regulation. \nOur operational systems and networks (as well as those of our franchise advisors and third parties) are subject to evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, loss of our proprietary information, damage to our reputation, additional costs to us, regulatory penalties and other adverse impacts. \nOur business is reliant upon internal and third-party-controlled, -developed and -operated software (which includes opensource software), technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store information, including our current, potential and former clients’, employees’ and advisors’ personal information, as well as our proprietary information, and to conduct many of our business activities and transactions. Maintaining the security and integrity of our software, information and these systems and networks, and appropriately responding to any cybersecurity and privacy incidents (including attempts to attack or access our network), is critical to the success of our business operations, including our reputation, the retention of our advisors and clients, and to the protection of our proprietary information and our clients’ personal information. \nWe rely on the third parties with whom we do business to identify and remediate software and other vulnerabilities in the assets and systems they use to run their business before they can be exploited by bad actors, but the third parties cannot always do so. For example, zero-day vulnerabilities in software and other technology solutions are immediately exploitable by bad actors as occasionally happens with certain of our vendors in the industry. We routinely face attacks and seek to address evolving threats of which we become aware. We have been able to identify, protect, detect, respond to and recover from these attacks to date without a material loss of client financial assets or information through the use of ongoing internal and external threat monitoring and by making continual adjustments to our security and incident response capabilities.\nWe and our advisors, as well as our service providers and clients, have also been threatened by, among others, phishing, vishing, and spear phishing scams, social engineering attacks (such as direct voice contact and any technology or communication mechanism to contact a person), account takeovers, introductions of malware, attempts at electronic break-ins, and the submission of fraudulent payment requests. The number of threats and events has increased substantially every year, which is expected to continue, particularly as the use of artificial intelligence makes these attempts look more legitimate. Attempted or successful breaches or interference by third parties or by insiders that may occur in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn a corporate basis, various laws and regulations, and in some cases contractual obligations, require us to establish and maintain corporate policies and technical and operational measures designed to protect sensitive client, employee, contractor and vendor information, and to respond to cybersecurity incidents in certain ways and timeframes. We have established policies and implemented such technical and operational measures ourselves and have in place policies that require our service providers and franchisee advisors, each of which control locally their own technology operations, to do the same. The hybrid work environment among our employees adds complexity to monitoring and processing procedures. Changes in our business or technological advancements may also require corresponding changes in our systems, networks and data security and response measures. While accessing our products and services, our clients may use computers and other devices that sit outside of our security control environment. In addition, the ever-increasing reliance on technology systems and networks and the occurrence and potential adverse impact of attacks on such systems and networks (including in recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies), both generally and in the financial services industry, have enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cybersecurity threats and report incidents they suffer. As these threats, and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks, continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources (both direct financial resources and indirect costs like people) to enhance or expand upon the technical and operational security and response measures we currently maintain or that we allow franchise advisors to maintain and control locally. These regulator-driven changes may adversely impact the client experience by, for example, requiring multiple or new means of verifying the identity of a client before they can interact with us. \nDespite the measures we have taken and may in the future take to address and mitigate cybersecurity, privacy and technology risks, we cannot be certain that our systems and networks, or those used by our vendors and franchisees, will not be subject to successful \n23\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nattacks, breaches or interference. Nor can we guarantee that advisors and employees will comply with our policies and procedures in this regard, that clients will engage in safe and secure online practices, or that vendors and franchisees will effectively deploy and maintain the security measures and protocols that we impose. Furthermore, human error occurs from time to time and such mistakes can lead to the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information. We have a vendor management process, but at times our software or service providers could push through updates that are not fully disclosed to us (or tested by them) and that could alter the control posture of their products. Any such event may result in operational disruptions, as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of, our proprietary information or client, employee, vendor, or advisor personal information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to respond to, eliminate, or mitigate further exposure, the loss of clients or advisors, or other damage to our business. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, it may not protect us against all cybersecurity- or privacy-related losses. Furthermore, we may be subject to indemnification costs and liability to third parties if we breach any confidentiality or security obligations regarding vendor data or for losses related to the data. In addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general-public notification of such incidents, including those where our vendors are the party being breached, could exacerbate the harm to our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations in the event of a breach. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data and conduct appropriate incident response, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our responses to any such attacks, as well as the adoption, implementation and maintenance of appropriate security measures. In addition, our regulators may seek to hold our company responsible for the acts, mistakes or omissions of our vendors or franchise advisors even where they procure and control much of the physical office space and technology infrastructure they use to operate their businesses locally.\nProtection from system interruptions and operating errors is important to our business. If we experience a sustained interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems, or other failure in operational execution, it could harm our business.\nOperating errors and system or network interruptions could delay and disrupt our operations. Interruptions could be caused by mistake, malfeasance or other operational failures by service provider staff, employee or advisor error or malfeasance, interference by third parties, including hackers, our implementation of new technology, maintenance of existing technology, or natural disasters, each of which may impact our ability to run our systems or encounter varying downtime. Though we plan for resiliency in our systems and test these capabilities, we could face additional downtime or data loss if our plans do not work as expected during a real event. Our financial, accounting, human resources, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate or report data properly, experience connectivity disruptions or otherwise become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process transactions or provide products and services to our clients (some of which have regulatory required response times). Further, we cannot control the execution of any business continuity or incident response plans implemented by our service providers or our franchise advisors.\nWe rely on third-party service providers and vendors for certain communications, technology and business functions and other services, and we face the risk of their operational failure (including, without limitation, loss of staff due to widespread illness, failure caused by an inaccuracy, untimeliness or other deficiency in data reporting), technical or security failures, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other third-party service providers that we use to facilitate or are component providers to our securities transactions and other product manufacturing and distribution activities. These risks are heightened by our deployment in response to both investor interest and evolution in the financial markets of increasingly sophisticated products and technological means for interacting with these products or client accounts. Any such failure, termination or constraint or flawed execution or response could adversely impact our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or otherwise achieve desired outcomes.\nRisk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments, products, vendors, or against all types of risk, including employee and financial advisor misconduct.\nOur policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Many of our methods of managing risk and the associated exposures are based upon our use of observed historical experience or expectations about future experience (e.g., market behavior, client/policyholder behavior, employee behavior, mortality, etc.) or statistics based on historical models. Experience may not emerge as expected and during periods of market volatility, or due to unforeseen events, the historically-derived experience and correlations may not be valid. As a result, these methods and models may not predict future exposures accurately, which could be significantly greater than what our models indicate. Further some controls are manual and are subject to inherent limitations and we have a general model risk where there is a risk of loss associated with insufficient or inaccurate models that we use to support our decisions. This could cause us to incur investment losses or cause our hedging and other risk management strategies to be ineffective. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.\nOur financial performance also requires us to develop, effectively manage, and market new or existing products and services that appropriately anticipate or respond to changes in the industry and evolving client demands. The development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of Asset Management and other products with a focus on environmental, social and governance matters, require continued innovative effort and may require significant time, resources, and ongoing support. Further, avoiding introducing or encouraging certain new products (such as cryptocurrency) creates the risk of losing assets or new flows to \n24\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\ncompetitors who encourage or support those products. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction and ongoing maintenance of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting and sometimes contradictory client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements.\nArtificial intelligence (including generative artificial intelligence) presents many benefits in terms of operating efficiency, but also certain risks that we need to seek to mitigate through our strategic and risk management policies, such as reliance on information that may be inaccurate or unfairly discriminatory results. In addition, the regulatory framework and expectations relating to the use of artificial intelligence are in their early stages as is the use (and how we manage the use) of artificial intelligence in our business.\nManagement of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including those associated with our key vendors. Insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency.\nAs a holding company, we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations.\nWe act as a holding company for our subsidiaries, through which substantially all of our operations are conducted. Dividends and returns of capital from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our intercompany arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay shareholder dividends and to meet our financial obligations. These obligations include our operating expenses, interest and principal on our borrowings, and any other contractual commitments. If the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment or return of capital and intercompany arrangements is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of additional debt, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets. If any of this happens, it could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance, banking and securities, and other laws and regulations may regulate the ability of many of our subsidiaries (such as our insurance, banking and brokerage subsidiaries, FCA-regulated asset management entities, and our face-amount certificate company) to pay dividends, return capital or make other permitted payments or practically impact our capital structure and dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Additionally, the rating organizations effectively impose various financial and capital requirements on our company and our insurance company subsidiaries in order for us to maintain our ratings and the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements, rating agency financial or capital expectations, and dividend-paying ability of our subsidiaries may be affected by a variety of factors, including markets, business plans, policyholder behavior, and investment decisions and performance. These differing requirements and expectations use different accounting frameworks (such as GAAP, statutory accounting principles or a mix). Further, the financial and capital requirements imposed upon our subsidiaries may be impacted by heightened regulatory or rating organization scrutiny and intervention, which could negatively affect our and our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. Additionally, in the past we have found it necessary and advisable to provide support to certain of our subsidiaries in order to maintain adequate capital for regulatory or other purposes and we may provide such support in the future. The provision of such support could adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and the dividends or other permitted payments received from our subsidiaries.\nThe operation of our business in foreign markets and our investments in non-U.S. denominated securities and investment products subjects us to exchange rate and other risks in connection with international operations and earnings and income generated overseas.\nWhile we are a U.S.-based company, a portion of our business operations occurs outside of the U.S. and some of our investments are not denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, we are exposed to certain foreign currency exchange risks that could reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings as well as negatively impact our general account and other proprietary investment portfolios. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar could, and has, unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments and investments in foreign subsidiaries. In comparison, depreciation of the U.S. dollar could positively affect our net income from foreign operations and the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, though such depreciation could also diminish investor, creditor and rating organizations’ perceptions of our company compared to peer companies that have a relatively greater proportion of foreign operations or investments.\nIn addition, conducting and increasing our international operations subjects us to additional risks that, generally, we do not face in the U.S., including: (i) potentially adverse cross-border tax consequences, including the complexities of transfer pricing, foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; (ii) the localization of our solutions and related costs; (iii) the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different, potentially conflicting legal standards, including laws and regulations; and (iv) social and economic situations outside of the U.S. The occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our results of operations generally. Additionally, operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources and we cannot be certain these operations will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability. \n25\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made disasters and catastrophes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters and catastrophes, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, fires, blackouts, severe winter weather, explosions, pandemic disease and global health emergencies and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, riots, civil unrest including large-scale protests, insurrections and military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Such disasters and catastrophes may damage our facilities, preventing our service providers, employees and financial advisors from performing their roles, or otherwise disturbing our ordinary business operations and by impacting insurance claims, as described below. These impacts could be particularly severe to the extent they affect access to physical facilities, the physical well-being of large numbers of our employees, our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy or release valuable data. Such disasters and catastrophes may also impact us indirectly by changing the condition and behaviors of our clients, business counterparties and regulators, as well as by causing declines or volatility in the economic and financial markets.  \nThe potential effects of natural and man-made disasters and catastrophes on certain of our businesses include but are not limited to the following: (i) a catastrophic loss of life may materially increase the amount of or accelerate the timing in which benefits are paid under our insurance policies; (ii) an increase in claims and any resulting increase in claims reserves caused by a disaster may harm the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby impacting the cost and availability of reinsurance and the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries; (iii) widespread unavailability of staff; and (iv) declines and volatility in the financial markets that may decrease the value of our assets under management and administration, which could harm our financial condition and reduce our management fees.\nWe face risks arising from acquisitions and divestitures. \nWe have made acquisitions and divestitures in the past and may pursue similar strategic transactions in the future. Risks in acquisition transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations and control environment (including our risk management policies and procedures), difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing clients of the acquired entities, assumed or unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, difficulties obtaining regulatory approval or integrating into regulatory regimes, difficulties with the software, technology and systems of the acquired entities that were subject to a different control posture before the acquisition (and until such time as we can replace these or make investments to uplift their capabilities), the failure of counterparties to satisfy any obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses, and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth expectations or expected synergies for the acquired businesses. Fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations (such as our 2021 acquisition of the BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business) takes a significant amount of time and attention and incurs both expected and unexpected integration costs over several years. Integrations, particularly larger and more global integrations, are time-consuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business.     \nRisks in divestiture transactions (many of which are present in sales of insurance blocks via reinsurance) include difficulties in the separation of the disposed business, retention of obligations to indemnify for certain liabilities, the failure of counterparties to satisfy payment obligations, unfavorable market conditions that may impact any earnout or contingency payment due to us, if any, and unexpected difficulties in losing employees of the disposed business. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions. Execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents, which may include approvals of the FRB and other domestic and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may negatively impact our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities. These risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from acquisitions or divestitures and could result in the failure to realize the full economic value of a strategic transaction or the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of an acquisition. These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time.\nLegal, Regulatory and Tax Risks\nLegal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses.\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our operations, both domestically and internationally. Actions brought against us may result in judgements, verdicts, awards, settlements, penalties, injunctions or other adverse results, including reputational damage. In addition, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our defense against such actions regardless of their outcome. Various regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our employees and independent financial advisors and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our employees or advisors, were or are deemed to be improper. Pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical of the industries and businesses in which we operate. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. \n26\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nOur businesses are heavily regulated, and changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses may have an adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition.\nVirtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of our parent company and our various subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations. For a discussion of the regulatory framework in which we operate, see “Business - Regulation” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Compliance with these applicable laws and regulations is expensive, time-consuming and personnel-intensive, and we have invested and will continue to invest substantial resources to ensure compliance by our parent company and our subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, registered representatives and agents. In addition, sometimes these laws and regulations (and potential changes) are in conflict. Further, any future legislation or changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, as well as changes to the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, may affect our operations and financial condition. Legislation could require changes to our business operations or our regulatory reporting relationships which can require significant cost, effort and trade-offs. Such changes may impact our business operations and profitability, increase our costs of doing business, increase compliance costs as well as have a material effect on fee rates, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, which could materially impact our products, services, investments, results of operations, products and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict. Ongoing changes to regulation and oversight of the financial industry may generate outcomes, the full impact of which cannot be immediately ascertained as government intervention could distort customary and expected commercial behavior.\nSome of the legislative and regulatory changes could present operational challenges and increase costs. Ultimately the complexities and increased costs of legislative and regulatory changes could have an impact on our ability to offer cost-effective and innovative products to our clients.\nAs a Savings and Loan Holding Company, we are subject to supervision by the FRB and various prudential standards that may limit our activities and strategies. \nAmeriprise Financial is subject to ongoing supervision by the FRB, including supervision and prudential standards, capital requirements, stress-testing, resolution planning, information security and privacy, and risk management requirements. Further, as a financial holding company, our activities are limited to those that are financial in nature, incidental to a financial activity or, with FRB approval, complementary to a financial activity. Our broker-dealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses. These requirements may hinder our ability to access funds from our subsidiaries. We may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. The federal banking regulators, including the OCC, FRB, FDIC, and SEC (through FINRA) have the authority and under certain circumstances, the obligation, to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise, including Ameriprise and its bank subsidiaries. Any changes to regulations or changes to the supervisory approach may also result in increased compliance costs to the extent we are required to modify our existing compliance policies, procedures and practices.\nCompliance with bank holding company laws and regulations, including the Volcker Rule, impacts the structure and availability of certain of our products and services and our costs in providing those products and services. Costs of compliance may be driven by how these laws and regulations and the scale of Ameriprise Bank evolves over the course of time as well as strategic acquisitions and other growth strategies we pursue in the future.\nFailure to meet one or more of these requirements could, depending on the violation, limit Ameriprise’s ability to undertake new activities, continue certain activities, or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies. Execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents, which may include approvals of the FRB and other domestic and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may negatively impact our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities. \nChanges in corporate tax laws and regulations and changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, as well as adverse determinations regarding the application of such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our earnings and could make some of our products less attractive to clients.\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. In addition, changes to the Internal Revenue Code, state or foreign tax laws, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes and reduce our earnings. Furthermore, guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury and others has been critical to the application and impact of new laws and in avoiding unintended impacts from legislation. The jurisdictions we operate in may not always provide clear guidance that is responsive to industry questions and concerns. If guidance is unclear, it could increase our taxes or create a potential for disagreement about interpretation of the tax code.  \nMany of the products we offer or on which our businesses are based (including both insurance products and non-insurance products) receive favorable treatment under current U.S. federal income or estate tax law. Changes in U.S. federal income or estate tax law could \n27\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\nreduce or eliminate the tax advantages of certain of our products and thus make such products less attractive to clients or cause a change in client demand and activity.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent registrations and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or attempt to use the same to defraud others. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our brand and reputation, copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how, or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection, or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.\nWe also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon, or constitute misappropriation of, such other party’s intellectual property rights. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services, or could otherwise limit our ability to offer certain product features. Any party that holds a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. The threat of patent litigation from non-practicing entities could impact financial services firms and successful resolution could still have a significant financial impact. We may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, license rights, or misappropriation of trade secret rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our clients or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in and the adoption of accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOur accounting policies provide a standard for how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that accounting changes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulators often change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and could impose additional governance, internal control and disclosure demands. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements.",

    "item1c": "Item 1C.  Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nCybersecurity is a key part of our business and client experience and is integrated into our enterprise risk management processes and policies.\n We maintain written policies, processes and procedures that seek to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from known and emerging cybersecurity risks. Our program includes consuming threat intelligence and ongoing monitoring of known external threats. We also have operating policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable requirements in jurisdictions we operate in globally. Our policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and internally assessed to enhance our corporate security capabilities. We make ongoing investments in our technology infrastructure to support cybersecurity efforts and support reliability and the user experience. We offer clients and advisors a variety of options to help secure their information, including multi-factor authentication and the use of secure messaging sites. We provide our employees and advisors with ongoing security training and periodically test their skills and understanding with various cybersecurity exercises.\nWe remain vigilant against cybersecurity risks as part of operating our business. \nOur cybersecurity team is led by experienced staff, including our \nChief Information Officer\n, who has been with the company in various technology positions since 2002. Previously, he worked for other companies holding senior delivery and architecture roles and holds both a bachelor’s degree in engineering and an MBA. Our Chief Information Security Officer has over 30 years of broad IT experience, with expertise in Information Security. His background also includes systems design and development, and he has expertise in database administration and database platforms across both mainframe and distributed platforms. Prior to joining the company, he worked as a consultant and a developer at other companies.\n Our risk management approach involves a matrixed structure of leaders who bring various levels of cybersecurity and technology expertise to their areas of risk management. Our technology team relies on their enterprise-wide colleagues’ expertise when needed to plan, respond, and mitigate incidents.\nWe conduct regular vulnerability scanning and related remediation activities for our applications and systems. We have documented expectations for the patching and updating of our software environment and set similar expectations for our financial advisors and third-party service providers where they retain control of their environment. Our cybersecurity approach supports both business \n28\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.\ncontinuity and risk mitigation. Should an incident occur, we have plans in place that are designed to mitigate the impact to our operations while we respond and recover, if necessary. We run a global security operations center that continuously monitors our networks and systems and is prepared to contact the appropriate teams to respond to an incident should one occur. Depending on the incident, the response group may include participation from a wide variety of groups across the enterprise. We conduct regular exercises to verify that our business continuity plans are capable of recovering our operating capabilities in line with our business needs and expectations. In addition, our global privacy team provides oversight and support to business and staff groups in conducting annual risk assessments regarding the secure handling of personally identifiable information.\nAdditionally, as part of our formal procurement and vendor management process, we ask our third-party service providers to have and maintain cybersecurity programs that are consistent with our legal and regulatory obligations, and we review cybersecurity risk assessments of those third-party service providers who provide key technology and services.\n For third-party service providers that do go through our formal procurement process and vendor risk management assessment, our Enterprise Third-Party Risk Management team assigns tiers. The tiers are based on a combination of criteria, including the services provided and the information to which they have access, to focus the most detailed reviews and the most frequent assessments on highest tiered third-party service providers, while also maintaining an appropriate level of review and monitoring on lower tiers. Some third-party service providers contracted outside of the formal procurement process may still be subject to providing information about their security programs based on services performed.\nOur Enterprise Third-Party Risk Management Office provides oversight and support to the business teams as end-users of the third-party service providers’ goods and services, while also providing a conduit through which oversight can be conducted by our management and Board of Directors. When a third-party service provider is off-boarded through our procurement and third-party risk management process, they are subject to an off-boarding review when the relationship ends that is designed to obtain the return or destruction of our information. Our Enterprise Third-Party Risk Management Office provides risk assessment reporting to business teams, internal risk management committees and our executive leadership. The reporting structure supports an effective design of the program, provides transparency, and drives regulatory compliance. Third-party service providers that participate in the delivery of services to us, as well as their fourth-parties, are also generally expected to have and maintain cybersecurity defenses, so long as they participate in the delivery of services to us to help protect our systems and our clients from incursions through third-party services’ systems. Should one of our third-party service providers suffer a breach in their or their fourth-party systems, we rely on them to inform us and work with us to protect our systems, remediate breaches, and mitigate the impact to our clients and our technology.\nGovernance\nStrong ongoing governance practices and policies support our cybersecurity program. \nThe Board of Directors and the Audit and Risk Committee are central to the oversight of the company’s cybersecurity risk management program operated by senior management.\n \nIn addition to the Audit and Risk Committee receiving quarterly cybersecurity updates, the Audit and Risk Committee discusses with management, the General Auditor, and others the company’s enterprise-wide risk assessment and risk management processes. These updates to the Audit and Risk Committee include a review of prevailing material risks and exposures, including cybersecurity and data protection threats and risks, the actions taken to address these threats and mitigate these risks, and the design and effectiveness of our processes and controls in light of evolving market, business, regulatory, and other conditions.\n \nOur Audit and Risk Committee has semiannual trainings, to which the full Board of Directors is also invited, to stay educated on ever-evolving cybersecurity topics. These processes and information sharing enable the Board of Directors, the Audit and Risk Committee, and our management team to remain informed and aligned about our approach to cybersecurity risk, and the monitoring of these risks and incidents, as appropriate. \nOur \nexecutive Vice President of Technology and Chief Information Officer, our Chief Information Security Officer, and other officers\n regularly review with our Board of Directors and the Audit and Risk Committee topics such as the following: the cyber threat landscape; the design, effectiveness and ongoing enhancement of our capabilities to identify, protect, detect, respond to and recover from cyber threats and events; and any incidents that merit discussion.\nDuring 2024, the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed and received reports on our identity theft prevention and privacy programs, including the following topics: emerging risks, identity theft threats, experience and trends; the effectiveness of existing controls and planned enhancements to controls; and key areas of focus for the identity theft and privacy programs.\n29\nIndex\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc."
