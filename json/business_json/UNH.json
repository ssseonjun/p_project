    "item1": "Item 1, “Business”\n and in\n Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nChange Healthcare Cyberattack\nAs previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers. \nWe have substantially mitigated the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and restored or replaced the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of more than $9 billion through December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $2.2 billion of direct response costs, including costs associated with providing interest-free loans; increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; network restoration; and notifications of impacted persons. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of $867 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts at a lesser extent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business.\nWe have determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million. The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights. Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals’ information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis. It is possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n24\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Trends\nOur businesses participate in the United States and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.\nPricing Trends.\n To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including medical care patterns, inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.\nThe commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs.\nMedicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in \n“Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties”\n and we have observed increased care patterns as discussed below in “Medical Cost Trends.” Our 2025 benefit design approach contemplates these trends.\nIn Medicaid, we believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.\nMedical Cost Trends. \nOur medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. As expected and contemplated in our benefits design, we have continued to observe increased care patterns, which may continue in future periods. We also observed an upshift in hospital coding intensity and an acceleration in the prescribing of certain high-cost medications in early response to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). We expect these additional factors to continue into future periods. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging hospitals, physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care.\nAs a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, we incurred medical costs related to the impact of the temporary suspension of some care management activities, impacting our UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health businesses, to help care providers with their workflow processes. Early in the second quarter we resumed these activities. For the year ended December 31, 2024, medical costs related to the temporary suspension of some care management activities were approximately $640 million.\nMedicaid Redeterminations. \nMedicaid redeterminations have impacted the number of people served through our Medicaid offerings, partially offset by an increase in consumers served through our commercial offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people and families have continued access to care. The Medicaid redetermination process has also caused a timing mismatch between the current health status of people served through Medicaid and state rate updates, which remained well short of current care activity. We expect this gap between people’s health status and rates will narrow in 2025.\nDelivery System and Payment Modernization.\n The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality and patient experience, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We are working to accelerate this vision through the innovation and integration of our care delivery models including in-clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual care, and by using our data and analytics to provide clinicians with the necessary information in order to provide the best possible care in the most cost efficient setting. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in fully accountable value-based plans rewarding high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration. \nThis trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. A key focus of our future growth is to accelerate the transition from fee-for-service care delivery and payment models to fully accountable value-based care. This transition requires initial costs such as system enhancements, integrated care coordination technology, physician training and clinical engagement. Enhanced clinical engagement is a critical step to improving the experience and health outcomes of the people we serve and should result in lower costs to the overall health system over time.\n25\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties\nFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to regulatory matters. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see \nPart I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation”\n and",
    "item1a": "Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nMedicare Advantage Rates. \nMedicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the Final Notice for 2024 and 2025 rates resulted in an industry base rate decrease, both of which are well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend. The Advance Notice for 2026 rates proposes an industry base rate increase also well short of forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges.\nAs a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.\nSELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS\nThe following summarizes select 2024 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2023 and other financial results.\n•\nConsolidated revenues grew 8%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 6% and Optum revenues grew 12%. \n•\nUnitedHealthcare served 2.1 million more people domestically, driven by growth in commercial offerings, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations.\n•\nEarnings from operations of $32.3 billion compared to $32.4 billion last year.\n•\nDiluted earnings per common share was $15.51, impacted by the loss on sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale.\n•\nCash flows from operations were $24.2 billion.\n26\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS SUMMARY\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:\n(in millions, except percentages and per share data)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nChange\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\nRevenues:\nPremiums\n$\n308,810 \n$\n290,827 \n$\n257,157 \n$\n17,983 \n6 \n%\nProducts\n50,226 \n42,583 \n37,424 \n7,643 \n18 \nServices\n36,040 \n34,123 \n27,551 \n1,917 \n6 \nInvestment and other income\n5,202 \n4,089 \n2,030 \n1,113 \n27 \nTotal revenues\n400,278 \n371,622 \n324,162 \n28,656 \n8 \nOperating costs:\nMedical costs\n264,185 \n241,894 \n210,842 \n22,291 \n9 \nOperating costs\n53,013 \n54,628 \n47,782 \n(1,615)\n(3)\nCost of products sold\n46,694 \n38,770 \n33,703 \n7,924 \n20 \nDepreciation and amortization\n4,099 \n3,972 \n3,400 \n127 \n3 \nTotal operating costs\n367,991 \n339,264 \n295,727 \n28,727 \n8 \nEarnings from operations\n32,287 \n32,358 \n28,435 \n(71)\n— \nInterest expense\n(3,906)\n(3,246)\n(2,092)\n(660)\n20 \nLoss on sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale\n(8,310)\n— \n— \n(8,310)\nnm\nEarnings before income taxes\n20,071 \n29,112 \n26,343 \n(9,041)\n(31)\nProvision for income taxes\n(4,829)\n(5,968)\n(5,704)\n1,139 \n(19)\nNet earnings\n15,242 \n23,144 \n20,639 \n(7,902)\n(34)\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(837)\n(763)\n(519)\n(74)\n10 \nNet earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders\n$\n14,405 \n$\n22,381 \n$\n20,120 \n$\n(7,976)\n(36)\n%\nDiluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders\n$\n15.51 \n$\n23.86 \n$\n21.18 \n$\n(8.35)\n(35)\n%\nMedical care ratio (a)\n85.5 \n%\n83.2 \n%\n82.0 \n%\n2.3 \n%\nOperating cost ratio\n13.2 \n14.7 \n14.7 \n(1.5)\nOperating margin\n8.1 \n8.7 \n8.8 \n(0.6)\nTax rate\n24.1 \n20.5 \n21.7 \n3.6 \nNet earnings margin (b)\n3.6 \n6.0 \n6.2 \n(2.4)\nReturn on equity (c)\n15.9 \n%\n27.0 \n%\n27.2 \n%\n(11.1)\n%\n________ \nnm = not meaningful\n(a)\nMedical care ratio (MCR) is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.\n(b)\nNet earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders.\n(c)\nReturn on equity is calculated as net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders divided by average shareholders’ equity.

The MCR increased as a result of the revenue effects of the Medicare funding reductions, Medicaid timing mismatch between people’s health status and rates, upshift in hospital coding intensity, specialty pharmaceutical prescribing patterns, member mix and due to incremental medical costs for accommodations made to care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOperating Cost Ratio\nThe operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to operating cost management and gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, partially offset by the impact of our direct response efforts to the Change Healthcare cyberattack and investments to support future growth.\nLoss on Sale of Subsidiary and Subsidiaries Held for Sale\nOn February 6, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Brazil operations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a loss of $7.1 billion, of which $4.1 billion related to the impact of cumulative foreign currency translation losses previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. \nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company initiated a plan to sell its remaining South American operations, which were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a loss of $1.2 billion, of which $855 million related to the impact of cumulative foreign currency translation losses. \nReportable Segments\nSee \nNote 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”\n for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.\nThe following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nChange\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\nRevenues\nUnitedHealthcare\n$\n298,208 \n$\n281,360 \n$\n249,741 \n$\n16,848 \n6 \n%\nOptum Health\n105,358 \n95,319 \n71,174 \n10,039 \n11 \nOptum Insight\n18,757 \n18,932 \n14,581 \n(175)\n(1)\nOptum Rx\n133,231 \n116,087 \n99,773 \n17,144 \n15 \nOptum eliminations\n(4,389)\n(3,703)\n(2,760)\n(686)\n19 \nOptum\n252,957 \n226,635 \n182,768 \n26,322 \n12 \nEliminations\n(150,887)\n(136,373)\n(108,347)\n(14,514)\n11 \nConsolidated revenues\n$\n400,278 \n$\n371,622 \n$\n324,162 \n$\n28,656 \n8 \n%\nEarnings from operations\nUnitedHealthcare\n$\n15,584 \n$\n16,415 \n$\n14,379 \n$\n(831)\n(5)\n%\nOptum Health\n7,770 \n6,560 \n6,032 \n1,210 \n18 \nOptum Insight\n3,097 \n4,268 \n3,588 \n(1,171)\n(27)\nOptum Rx\n5,836 \n5,115 \n4,436 \n721 \n14 \nOptum\n16,703 \n15,943 \n14,056 \n760 \n5 \nConsolidated earnings from operations\n$\n32,287 \n$\n32,358 \n$\n28,435 \n$\n(71)\n— \n%\nOperating margin\nUnitedHealthcare\n5.2 \n%\n5.8 \n%\n5.8 \n%\n(0.6)\n%\nOptum Health\n7.4 \n6.9 \n8.5 \n0.5 \nOptum Insight\n16.5 \n22.5 \n24.6 \n(6.0)\nOptum Rx\n4.4 \n4.4 \n4.4 \n— \nOptum\n6.6 \n7.0 \n7.7 \n(0.4)\nConsolidated operating margin\n8.1 \n%\n8.7 \n%\n8.8 \n%\n(0.6)\n%\n28\nTable of Contents\nUnitedHealthcare\nThe following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nChange\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\nUnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Domestic\n$\n74,489 \n$\n67,187 \n$\n63,599 \n$\n7,302 \n11 \n%\nUnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Global\n3,667 \n9,307 \n8,668 \n(5,640)\n(61)\nUnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Total\n78,156 \n76,494 \n72,267 \n1,662 \n2 \nUnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement\n139,482 \n129,862 \n113,671 \n9,620 \n7 \nUnitedHealthcare Community & State\n80,570 \n75,004 \n63,803 \n5,566 \n7 \nTotal UnitedHealthcare revenues\n$\n298,208 \n$\n281,360 \n$\n249,741 \n$\n16,848 \n6 \n%\nThe following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement:\n \nDecember 31,\nChange\n(in thousands, except percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\nCommercial - domestic:\nRisk-based\n8,845 \n8,115 \n8,045 \n730 \n9 \n%\nFee-based\n20,885 \n19,200 \n18,640 \n1,685 \n9 \nTotal commercial - domestic\n29,730 \n27,315 \n26,685 \n2,415 \n9 \nMedicare Advantage\n7,845 \n7,695 \n7,105 \n150 \n2 \nMedicaid\n7,435 \n7,845 \n8,170 \n(410)\n(5)\nMedicare Supplement (Standardized)\n4,335 \n4,355 \n4,375 \n(20)\n— \nTotal community and senior\n19,615 \n19,895 \n19,650 \n(280)\n(1)\nTotal UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical\n49,345 \n47,210 \n46,335 \n2,135 \n5 \nCommercial - global\n1,330 \n5,540 \n5,360 \n(4,210)\n(76)\nTotal UnitedHealthcare - medical\n50,675 \n52,750 \n51,695 \n(2,075)\n(4)\n%\nSupplemental Data:\nMedicare Part D stand-alone\n3,050 \n3,315 \n3,295 \n(265)\n(8)\n%\nUnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage and domestic commercial offerings, partially offset by decreased people served globally due to the sale of the Brazil operations and in Medicaid offerings due to redeterminations. Earnings from operations decreased due to Medicare Advantage funding reductions, the impacts of Medicaid redeterminations, member mix and incremental medical costs for accommodations to support care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, and the growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage and domestic commercial offerings.\nOptum\nTotal revenues increased due to growth at Optum Rx and Optum Health. Earnings from operations increased with growth at Optum Health and Optum Rx, partially offset by decreased earnings from operations at Optum Insight. The results by segment were as follows:\nOptum Health\nRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements. Earnings from operations increased due to gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, increased investment income and cost management initiatives, partially offset by Medicare Advantage funding reductions, costs associated with serving newly added patients under value-based care arrangements and medical care activity. Optum Health served approximately 100 million people as of December 31, 2024 compared to 103 million people as of December 31, 2023. \n29\nTable of Contents\nOptum Insight\nRevenues at Optum Insight decreased primarily due the business disruption impacts from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by growth in technology services. Earnings from operations decreased primarily due to direct response costs and business disruption impacts related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions.\nOptum Rx\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from both new clients and growth in existing clients and growth in pharmacy services. Earnings from operations also increased due to operating cost efficiencies and supply chain initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1,623 million and 1,542 million adjusted scripts in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nIntroduction\nWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally derived from earnings before noncash expenses. \nOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.\nOur U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $9.2 billion and $8.0 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”\n for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.\nOur nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.\n30\nTable of Contents\nSummary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nChange\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\nSources of cash:\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n24,204 \n$\n29,068 \n$\n26,206 \n$\n(4,864)\nIssuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments\n14,660 \n4,280 \n12,536 \n10,380 \nProceeds from common share issuances\n1,846 \n1,353 \n1,253 \n493 \nCustomer funds administered\n— \n— \n5,548 \n— \nCash received for dispositions\n2,041 \n685 \n3,414 \n1,356 \nSales and maturities of investments, net of purchases\n525 \n— \n— \n525 \nTotal sources of cash\n43,276 \n35,386 \n48,957 \n7,890 \nUses of cash:\nCash paid for acquisitions and other transactions, net of cash assumed\n(13,408)\n(10,136)\n(21,458)\n(3,272)\nCommon share repurchases\n(9,000)\n(8,000)\n(7,000)\n(1,000)\nCash dividends paid\n(7,533)\n(6,761)\n(5,991)\n(772)\nPurchases of property, equipment and capitalized software\n(3,499)\n(3,386)\n(2,802)\n(113)\nPurchases of investments, net of sales and maturities \n— \n(1,777)\n(6,837)\n1,777 \nPurchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests\n(280)\n(730)\n(176)\n450 \nLoans to care providers - cyberattack, net of repayments\n(4,519)\n— \n— \n(4,519)\nCustomer funds administered\n(1,560)\n(521)\n— \n(1,039)\nOther\n(3,312)\n(2,110)\n(2,737)\n(1,202)\nTotal uses of cash\n(43,111)\n(33,421)\n(47,001)\n(9,690)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(61)\n97 \n34 \n(158)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents, including cash within businesses held for sale \n$\n104 \n$\n2,062 \n$\n1,990 \n$\n(1,958)\nLess: cash within businesses held for sale\n(219)\n— \n— \n(219)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(115)\n$\n2,062 \n$\n1,990 \n$\n(2,177)\n2024 Cash Flows Compared to 2023 Cash Flows\nDecreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by CMS Medicare funding reductions, Change Healthcare cyberattack response actions, increased medical costs and changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net sales and maturities of investments and cash received from dispositions, offset by loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, increased cash paid for acquisitions and other transactions, decreased customer funds administered and increased share repurchases.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $77.1 billion included $25.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which approximately $800 million was available for general corporate use), $46.9 billion of debt securities and $4.9 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See \nNote 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”\n for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.2 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2024. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n31\nTable of Contents\nCapital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\nCash Requirements. \nThe Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. \nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n•\nDebt obligations.\n See \nNote 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements \nand Supplementary Data\n”\n for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.\n•\nOperating leases.\n See \nNote 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements \nand Supplementary Data\n”\n for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n•\nPurchase and other obligations.\n These include $11.5 billion, $2.4 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds, strategic transactions and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nOther liabilities.\n These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n•\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests.\n \nSee \nNote 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements \nand Supplementary Data\n”\n for further detail. We do not have any material potential required redemptions in the next twelve months.\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\nShort-Term Borrowings.\n Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see \nNote 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the various covenants under our bank credit facilities.\nLong-Term Debt.\n Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see \nNote 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nCredit Ratings.\n Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2024 were as follows: \n \n \nMoody’s\nS&P Global\nFitch\nA.M. Best\n \nRatings\nOutlook\nRatings\nOutlook\nRatings\nOutlook\nRatings\nOutlook\nSenior unsecured debt\nA2\nStable\nA+\nStable\nA\nStable\nA\nStable\nCommercial paper\nP-1\nn/a\nA-1\nn/a\nF1\nn/a\nAMB-1+\nn/a\nThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.\n32\nTable of Contents\nShare Repurchase Program.\n In June 2024, our Board of Directors amended our share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 35 million shares of Common Stock, in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board’s 2018 renewal of the program. As of December 31, 2024, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 33 million shares of our common stock. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program. For more information on our share repurchase program, see \nNote 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nDividends. \nIn June 2024, our Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $8.40 compared to $7.52 per share. For more information on our dividend, see \nNote 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nPending Acquisitions.\n As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $4 billion.\nWe do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. \nMedical Costs Payable\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service.\nIn each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $700 million, $840 million and $410 million, respectively.\nIn developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.\nCompletion Factors.\n A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), actual care activity incurred (which can be influenced by pandemics or seasonal illnesses, such as influenza), or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2024: \nCompletion Factors\n(Decrease) Increase in Factors\nIncrease (Decrease)\nIn Medical Costs Payable\n(in millions)\n(0.75)%\n$\n973 \n(0.50)\n647 \n(0.25)\n322 \n0.25\n(321)\n0.50\n(640)\n0.75\n(958)\nMedical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors.\n Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and seasonal and other incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics. \nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2024: \nMedical Cost PMPM Quarterly Trend\nIncrease (Decrease) in Factors\nIncrease (Decrease)\nIn Medical Costs Payable\n(in millions)\n3%\n$\n1,264 \n2\n843 \n1\n421 \n(1)\n(421)\n(2)\n(843)\n(3)\n(1,264)\nThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. \nManagement believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2024; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2024 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, 2024 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $260 million. \nFor more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see \nNote 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n \nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost factors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method which includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.\nFinancial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates and cash flow projections to analyze the potential for a material impact. As of October 1, 2024, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.\nLEGAL MATTERS\nA description of our legal proceedings is presented in \nNote 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n \nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\nInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2024, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.\n35\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $33 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2024, $27 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.\nThe fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, $46 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $49 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.\nWe manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.\nThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):\nDecember 31, 2024\nIncrease (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate\nInvestment\nIncome Per\nAnnum\nInterest\nExpense Per\nAnnum\nFair Value of\nFinancial Assets\nFair Value of\nFinancial Liabilities \n2 %\n$\n666 \n$\n537 \n$\n(4,151)\n$\n(8,866)\n1\n333 \n268 \n(2,182)\n(4,828)\n(1)\n(333)\n(252)\n2,082 \n5,831 \n(2)\n(666)\n(503)\n4,311 \n12,935 \nDecember 31, 2023\nIncrease (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate\nInvestment\nIncome Per\nAnnum\nInterest\nExpense Per\nAnnum\nFair Value of\nFinancial Assets\nFair Value of\nFinancial Liabilities \n2%\n$\n688 \n$\n393 \n$\n(3,642)\n$\n(8,142)\n1\n344 \n196 \n(1,871)\n(4,444)\n(1)\n(344)\n(180)\n1,954 \n5,391 \n(2)\n(688)\n(360)\n3,964 \n11,992 \nNote: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $\n4.9\n billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of venture investments and employee savings plan related investments.\n36\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (\nPCAOB ID No \n34\n)\n38\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n40\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n41\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n42\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\n43\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n44\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n45\n1.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nMedical Care Services Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nMedical costs payable includes estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR) using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of actual care activity, and processing cycles.\nWe identified medical care services IBNR as a critical audit matter because it requires significant management assumptions in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methods, assumptions, and judgments in developing estimates for medical care services IBNR.\n38\nTable of Contents\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to medical care services IBNR included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s estimate of the IBNR for these services, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process.\n•\nWe tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate.\n•\nWith the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate IBNR for these services by:\n–\nPerforming an overlay of the historical claims data used in management’s current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods.\n–\nDeveloping an independent estimate of the IBNR for these services and comparing our estimate to management’s estimate.\n–\nPerforming a retrospective review comparing management’s prior year estimate of IBNR to claims processed in 2024 with dates of service in 2023 or prior.\n/\nS\n/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nFebruary 27, 2025\nWe have served

of Business\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company’s two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\n2.\nBasis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\nUse of Estimates\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\nRevenues \nPremiums\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers’ health care and related administrative costs.\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company’s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company’s individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans’ Star rating. Certain of the Company’s Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\nThe Company’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company’s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See \nNote 12\n for additional information regarding these audits.\n45\nTable of Contents\nProducts and Services\nFor the Company’s Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors’ members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis.\nServices revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health’s service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured for each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers.\nServices revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives a monthly fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees’ dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivables related to products and services were $\n9.9\n billion and $\n8.6\n billion, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.\nAs of December 31, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $\n12.7\n billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next \nthree years\n.\nSee \nNote 14\n for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.\nMedical Costs and Medical Costs Payable\nThe Company’s estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2024.\nEach period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately \n90\n% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months.\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and \n46\nTable of Contents\ndemographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography.\nIn developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\nCost of Products Sold \nThe Company’s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company’s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments \nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments.\n \nInvestments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments are measured at fair value, with certain exceptions where the Company has elected to measure investments with unobservable inputs at cost, subject to fair value adjustments upon an impairment or a transaction of the same or similar security. Changes in fair value of equity investments are recognized in net earnings.\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. \nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality.\n \nAssets Under Management \nIn July 2024, the Company amended its Medicare Supplement Program with a membership organization (the Medicare Supplement Program). The amendments provide the Company the right to use a trade name and other intellectual property in marketing efforts for Medicare Supplement offerings. Amounts previously reported as assets under management are now included within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet based upon their classification.\nFor periods prior to the amended Medicare Supplement Program, the Company excluded the effects of certain balance sheet amounts in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while these effects are included for periods after the amendments.\nOther Current Receivables \nOther current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. \n47\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers’ products by its affiliated and unaffiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $\n12.5\n billion and $\n11.0\n billion, respectively.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets included pharmaceutical drug and supplies inventory of $\n3.8\n billion and $\n2.8\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nProperty, Equipment and Capitalized Software \nProperty, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. \nThe Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. \nThe useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: \nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n3\n to \n10\n years\nBuildings\n35\n to \n40\n years\nCapitalized software\n3\n to \n5\n years\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases which are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period closely matching the lease term. \nThe Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and \nlease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet\n.\n \nGoodwill \nTo determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs impairment tests. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital levels and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.\nThere was \nno\n impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was \nno\n impairment of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nOther Current Liabilities \nOther current liabilities include health savings account deposits ($\n13.7\n billion and $\n13.5\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively), accruals for premium rebates payable, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances.\n48\nTable of Contents\nPolicy Acquisition Costs\nThe Company’s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least \n30\n days’ notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside of the Company’s control are classified as temporary equity. These interests primarily relate to put options on unowned shares, which are typically redeemable at fair value after a certain time period. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value to the earliest redemption date utilizing the interest method. If all interests were currently redeemable, the difference between the carrying value and the estimated redemption value is not material.\n \nThe following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests’ activity for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period\n$\n4,498\n \n$\n4,897\n \nNet earnings\n174\n \n188\n \nAcquisitions\n33\n \n122\n \nRedemptions\n(\n280\n)\n(\n730\n)\nDistributions \n(\n125\n)\n(\n144\n)\nFair value and other adjustments\n23\n \n165\n \nRedeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period\n$\n4,323\n \n$\n4,498\n \nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee’s eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over \nfour\n years, and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options vest ratably primarily over \nfour\n years and may be exercised up to \n10\n years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company’s stock at a discounted price, which is 90% of the market price of the Company’s common stock at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \nNet Earnings Per Common Share \nThe Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares.\n \n49\nTable of Contents\n3.    \nInvestments\nA summary of debt securities by major security type is as follows:\n(in millions)\nAmortized\nCost\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nDecember 31, 2024\nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\nU.S. government and agency obligations\n$\n4,600\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n(\n274\n)\n$\n4,327\n \nState and municipal obligations\n7,357\n \n2\n \n(\n375\n)\n6,984\n \nCorporate obligations\n24,391\n \n56\n \n(\n1,140\n)\n23,307\n \nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n10,577\n \n1\n \n(\n994\n)\n9,584\n \nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n2,890\n \n2\n \n(\n175\n)\n2,717\n \nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale\n49,815\n \n62\n \n(\n2,958\n)\n46,919\n \nDebt securities - held-to-maturity:\nU.S. government and agency obligations\n444\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n442\n \nState and municipal obligations\n28\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n26\n \nCorporate obligations\n40\n \n—\n \n—\n \n40\n \nTotal debt securities - held-to-maturity\n512\n \n—\n \n(\n4\n)\n508\n \nTotal debt securities\n$\n50,327\n \n$\n62\n \n$\n(\n2,962\n)\n$\n47,427\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\nU.S. government and agency obligations\n$\n4,674\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n234\n)\n$\n4,443\n \nState and municipal obligations\n7,636\n \n39\n \n(\n322\n)\n7,353\n \nCorporate obligations\n23,136\n \n67\n \n(\n1,186\n)\n22,017\n \nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n8,982\n \n22\n \n(\n708\n)\n8,296\n \nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n3,023\n \n3\n \n(\n240\n)\n2,786\n \nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale\n47,451\n \n134\n \n(\n2,690\n)\n44,895\n \nDebt securities - held-to-maturity:\nU.S. government and agency obligations\n506\n \n1\n \n(\n6\n)\n501\n \nState and municipal obligations\n28\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n26\n \nCorporate obligations\n69\n \n—\n \n—\n \n69\n \nTotal debt securities - held-to-maturity\n603\n \n1\n \n(\n8\n)\n596\n \nTotal debt securities\n$\n48,054\n \n$\n135\n \n$\n(\n2,698\n)\n$\n45,491\n \nNearly all of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities were rated “Double A” or better as of December 31, 2024. \nThe Company held $\n4.9\n billion of equity securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company believes it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectibility of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not material.\n4.    \nFair Value\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input which is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. \n51\nTable of Contents\nThe fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows:\nLevel 1\n — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. \nLevel 2\n — Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including:\n•\nQuoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets;\n•\nQuoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time);\n•\nInputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and\n•\nInputs corroborated by other observable market data.\nLevel 3\n — Unobservable inputs cannot be corroborated by observable market data.\nThere were \nno\n transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nNonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $\n710\n million, $\n276\n million and $\n211\n million respectively, of unrealized gains in investment and other income related to fair value adjustments on equity securities primarily in the Company’s venture portfolio, based upon transactions of the same or similar security. The assets and liabilities within our South American operations held for sale as of December 31, 2024 were measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value is measured based upon unobservable amounts, such as estimated selling price derived from Company-specific information and market conditions. There were \nno\n other significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below:\nCash and Cash Equivalents. \nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2.\nDebt and Equity Securities.\n Fair values of debt securities and equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company’s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment to the prices obtained from the pricing service.\nFair values of debt securities which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. \nFair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. \nThe fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds, which are not a significant portion of our investments, are estimated using valuation techniques relying heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. \nThroughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company’s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on such understanding.\n52\nTable of Contents\nLong-Term Debt. \nThe fair values of the Company’s long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Company’s investments in debt securities.\nThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n(in millions)\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets\n(Level 1)\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nTotal\nFair and Carrying\nValue\nDecember 31, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n25,248\n \n$\n64\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n25,312\n \nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\nU.S. government and agency obligations\n4,194\n \n133\n \n—\n \n4,327\n \nState and municipal obligations\n—\n \n6,984\n \n—\n \n6,984\n \nCorporate obligations\n29\n \n22,841\n \n437\n \n23,307\n \nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n9,584\n \n—\n \n9,584\n \nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n2,717\n \n—\n \n2,717\n \nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale\n4,223\n \n42,259\n \n437\n \n46,919\n \nEquity securities\n1,859\n \n24\n \n65\n \n1,948\n \nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n31,330\n \n$\n42,347\n \n$\n502\n \n$\n74,179\n \nPercentage of total assets at fair value\n42 \n%\n57 \n%\n1 \n%\n100 \n%\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n25,345\n \n$\n82\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n25,427\n \nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\nU.S. government and agency obligations\n4,167\n \n276\n \n—\n \n4,443\n \nState and municipal obligations\n—\n \n7,353\n \n—\n \n7,353\n \nCorporate obligations\n15\n \n21,800\n \n202\n \n22,017\n \nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n8,296\n \n—\n \n8,296\n \nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n2,786\n \n—\n \n2,786\n \nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale\n4,182\n \n40,511\n \n202\n \n44,895\n \nEquity securities\n2,468\n \n16\n \n69\n \n2,553\n \nAssets under management\n1,505\n \n2,140\n \n110\n \n3,755\n \nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n33,500\n \n$\n42,749\n \n$\n381\n \n$\n76,630\n \nPercentage of total assets at fair value\n44 \n%\n55 \n%\n1 \n%\n100 \n%\nThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n(in millions)\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets\n(Level 1)\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nTotal\nFair\nValue\nTotal Carrying Value\nDecember 31, 2024\nDebt securities - held-to-maturity\n$\n482\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n508\n \n$\n512\n \nLong-term debt and other financing obligations\n$\n—\n \n$\n70,565\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n70,565\n \n$\n75,604\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nDebt securities - held-to-maturity\n$\n524\n \n$\n72\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n596\n \n$\n603\n \nLong-term debt and other financing obligations\n$\n—\n \n$\n59,851\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n59,851\n \n$\n61,449\n \nThe carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on one-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a SOFR Adjustment of 10 basis points plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2024, annual interest rates would have ranged from \n4.9\n% to \n7.5\n%. \nDebt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the various covenants under its bank credit facilities.\n9.    \nIncome Taxes \nThe current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses.\nThe components of income before income taxes, based upon tax jurisdiction, for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome before income taxes:\n \n \nDomestic\n$\n28,264\n \n$\n29,210\n \n$\n26,685\n \nForeign\n(\n8,193\n)\n(\n98\n)\n(\n342\n)\nTotal income before income taxes\n$\n20,071\n \n$\n29,112\n \n$\n26,343\n \nThe components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCurrent Provision:\n \n \nFederal\n$\n3,453\n \n$\n4,418\n \n$\n4,842\n \nState and local\n416\n \n716\n \n855\n \nForeign\n1,256\n \n1,079\n \n680\n \nTotal current provision\n5,125\n \n6,213\n \n6,377\n \nDeferred benefit\n(\n296\n)\n(\n245\n)\n(\n673\n)\nTotal provision for income taxes\n$\n4,829\n \n$\n5,968\n \n$\n5,704\n \n58\nTable of Contents\nThe reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows:\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate\n$\n4,215\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n6,114\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n5,532\n \n21.0\n \n%\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n343\n \n1.7\n \n567\n \n2.0\n \n621\n \n2.4\n \nShare-based awards - excess tax benefit\n(\n96\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\n(\n75\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n110\n)\n(\n0.4\n)\nNon-deductible compensation\n171\n \n0.9\n \n174\n \n0.6\n \n150\n \n0.6\n \nForeign rate differential\n(\n369\n)\n(\n1.8\n)\n(\n442\n)\n(\n1.5\n)\n(\n265\n)\n(\n1.0\n)\nTax effect of dispositions and other strategic transactions\n1,215\n \n6.1\n \n(\n29\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\n(\n215\n)\n(\n0.8\n)\nOther, net\n(\n650\n)\n(\n3.3\n)\n(\n341\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n4,829\n \n24.1\n \n%\n$\n5,968\n \n20.5\n \n%\n$\n5,704\n \n21.7\n \n%\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. \nThe components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nDeferred income tax assets:\n \n \nAccrued expenses and allowances\n$\n1,055\n \n$\n754\n \nU.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards\n442\n \n417\n \nShare-based compensation\n189\n \n173\n \nNondeductible liabilities\n343\n \n329\n \nNon-U.S. tax loss carryforwards\n21\n \n1,061\n \nLease liability\n846\n \n930\n \n  Net unrealized losses on investments\n669\n \n586\n \nOther-domestic\n597\n \n327\n \nOther-non-U.S.\n59\n \n484\n \nSubtotal\n4,221\n \n5,061\n \nLess: valuation allowances\n(\n397\n)\n(\n366\n)\nTotal deferred income tax assets\n3,824\n \n4,695\n \nDeferred income tax liabilities:\nU.S. federal and state intangible assets\n(\n4,479\n)\n(\n3,712\n)\nNon-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets\n(\n82\n)\n(\n731\n)\nCapitalized software\n(\n288\n)\n(\n415\n)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(\n400\n)\n(\n371\n)\nPrepaid expenses\n(\n374\n)\n(\n326\n)\nOutside basis in partnerships\n(\n960\n)\n(\n811\n)\nLease right-of-use asset\n(\n833\n)\n(\n914\n)\nOther-non-U.S.\n(\n28\n)\n(\n436\n)\nTotal deferred income tax liabilities\n(\n7,444\n)\n(\n7,716\n)\nNet deferred income tax liabilities\n$\n(\n3,620\n)\n$\n(\n3,021\n)\nValuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Substantially all of the federal net operating loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2025 through 2044, with some having an indefinite carryforward period. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the Company has historical non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for which a deferred tax asset and valuation allowance of $4.1 billion are not established because realization of the loss carryforwards is remote.\nAs of December 31, 2024, except for subsidiaries held for sale, the Company’s undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal.\n59\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period\n$\n3,716\n \n$\n3,081\n \n$\n2,310\n \nGross increases:\n \n \n \nCurrent year tax positions\n578\n \n782\n \n586\n \nPrior year tax positions\n10\n \n97\n \n206\n \nGross decreases:\n \n \n \nPrior year tax positions\n(\n121\n)\n(\n212\n)\n(\n21\n)\nStatute of limitations lapses and settlements\n(\n60\n)\n(\n32\n)\n—\n \nGross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period\n$\n4,123\n \n$\n3,716\n \n$\n3,081\n \nThe Company believes it is reasonably possible its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $\n101\n million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations.\nThe Company classifies net interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $\n210\n million, $\n177\n million and $\n64\n million of net interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $\n637\n million and $\n430\n million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2024, there were $\n2.0\n billion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\nThe Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Company’s 2017 through 2020 tax years are under review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. The Company is no longer subject to state income tax examinations prior to the 2015 tax year. The Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2015 and forward.\n10.    \nShareholders' Equity\nRegulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions\nThe Company’s regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions which may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these state regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $\n9.2\n billion, including $\n2.6\n billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $\n8.0\n billion, including $\n4.9\n billion of extraordinary dividends.\nThe Company's financially regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $\n37.8\n billion as of December 31, 2024. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's financially regulated subsidiaries was approximately $\n20.4\n billion as of December 31, 2024.\nOptum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the FDIC under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2024, the Company believes Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized.”\nShare Repurchase Program\nUnder its Board of Directors’ authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company’s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain restrictions. In June 2024, the Board of Directors amended the Company’s share repurchase program to authorize the \n60\nTable of Contents\nrepurchase of up to \n35\n million shares of its common stock, in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board’s 2018 renewal of the program. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program.\nA summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2024\n2023\nCommon share repurchases, shares\n17\n \n16\n \nCommon share repurchases, average price per share\n$\n529.85\n \n$\n493.79\n \nCommon share repurchases, aggregate cost\n$\n8,942\n \n$\n8,000\n \nBoard authorized shares remaining\n33\n \n15\n \nDividends\nIn June 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $8.40 compared to $7.52 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2023. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.\nThe following table provides details of the Company’s 2024 dividend payments:\nPayment Date\nAmount per Share\nTotal Amount Paid\n(in millions)\nMarch 19\n$\n1.88\n \n$\n1,729\n \nJune 25\n2.10\n \n1,935\n \nSeptember 24\n2.10\n \n1,937\n \nDecember 17\n2.10\n \n1,932\n \n11.    \nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company’s outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had \n48\n million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2024, there were \n16\n million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. \nStock Options\nStock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 is summarized in the table below:\nShares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nWeighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual Life\nAggregate\nIntrinsic Value\n \n(in millions)\n \n(in years)\n(in millions)\nOutstanding at beginning of period\n21\n \n$\n320\n \nGranted\n3\n \n522\n \nExercised\n(\n6\n)\n253\n \nForfeited\n(\n1\n)\n480\n \nOutstanding at end of period\n17\n \n370\n \n5.6\n$\n2,338\n \nExercisable at end of period\n10\n \n298\n \n4.2\n2,115\n \nVested and expected to vest, end of period\n17\n \n368\n \n5.5\n2,335\n \n61\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Shares\nRestricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 is summarized in the table below:\n(shares in millions)\nShares\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nper Share\nNonvested at beginning of period\n4\n \n$\n449\n \nGranted\n2\n \n523\n \nVested\n(\n2\n)\n435\n \nNonvested at end of period\n4\n \n489\n \nOther Share-Based Compensation Data\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStock Options\nWeighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share\n$\n138\n \n$\n134\n \n$\n116\n \nTotal intrinsic value of stock options exercised\n1,886\n \n1,325\n \n1,419\n \nRestricted Shares\nWeighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share\n523\n \n493\n \n483\n \nTotal fair value of restricted shares vested\n690\n \n803\n \n760\n \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nNumber of shares purchased\n1\n \n1\n \n1\n \nShare-Based Compensation Items\nShare-based compensation expense, before tax\n$\n1,018\n \n$\n1,059\n \n$\n925\n \nShare-based compensation expense, net of tax effects\n896\n \n937\n \n836\n \nIncome tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises\n216\n \n231\n \n207\n \n(in millions, except years)\nDecember 31, 2024\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to share awards\n$\n1,099\n \nWeighted-average years to recognize compensation expense\n1.3\nShare-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates\nThe principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options were as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRisk-free interest rate\n3.6\n% - \n4.4\n%\n3.8\n% - \n4.6\n%\n1.9\n% - \n4.3\n%\nExpected volatility\n25.5\n% - \n30.7\n%\n29.7\n% - \n30.6\n%\n30.6\n% - \n30.8\n%\nExpected dividend yield\n1.4\n% - \n1.5\n%\n1.3\n% - \n1.5\n%\n1.2\n%\nForfeiture rate\n5.0\n%\n5.0\n%\n5.0\n%\nExpected life in years\n4.6\n4.6\n4.7\nRisk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company’s common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options granted represent the periods of time the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns.\nOther Employee Benefit Plans \nThe Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nIn addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments \n62\nTable of Contents\nwith an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $\n2.1\n billion and $\n1.9\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n12.    \nCommitments and Contingencies\nLeases\nOperating lease costs, including immaterial variable and short-term lease costs, were $\n1.4\n billion, $\n1.4\n billion and $\n1.3\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash payments made on the Company’s operating lease liabilities were $\n1.1\n billion, $\n1.1\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which were classified within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for its operating leases were \n9.5\n years and \n4.7\n%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, future minimum annual lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: \n(in millions)\nFuture Minimum Lease Payments\n2025\n$\n1,014\n \n2026\n876\n \n2027\n688\n \n2028\n568\n \n2029\n583\n \nThereafter\n2,465\n \nTotal future minimum lease payments\n6,194\n \nLess imputed interest\n(\n1,305\n)\nTotal\n$\n4,889\n \nOther Commitments\nThe Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nPending Acquisitions\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $\n4\n billion.\nLegal Matters\nThe Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices.\nThe Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred.\nGovernment Investigations, Audits and Reviews\nThe Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office for Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the \n63\nTable of Contents\nFDIC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and other governmental authorities. Similarly, the Company’s international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status.\n13.    \nDispositions and Held for Sale\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company completed or initiated various business portfolio refinement and asset disposition activities. The Company recorded a loss of $\n7.1\n billion related to the sale of its Brazil operations, of which $\n4.1\n billion related to the impact of cumulative foreign currency translation losses previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and a loss of $\n1.2\n billion related to the reclassification of the Company’s remaining South American operations as held for sale, of which $\n855\n million related to the impact of cumulative foreign currency translation losses. \nAs these losses relate to our strategic exit of South American markets and include significant losses related to foreign currency translation effects, these losses are included within loss on sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The sales of the Company’s remaining South American assets are expected to close within a year, subject to regulatory and other customary closing conditions. Assets and liabilities held for sale have been included within prepaid and other current assets and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. \nThe assets and liabilities of the Brazil and held for sale disposal groups as of the date of the sale and as of December 31, 2024, respectively, were as follows:\n(in millions)\nBrazil \nDisposition\nBusinesses \nHeld for Sale\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n778\n \n$\n219\n \nAccounts receivable and other current assets\n515\n \n573\nLong-term investments\n788\n \n41\nProperty, equipment and capitalized software\n1,052\n \n641\nDeferred tax assets\n1,035\n \n—\n \nGoodwill and other intangible assets\n317\n \n413\nOther long-term assets\n439\n \n231\nRemeasurement of assets of businesses held for sale to fair value less cost to sell\n(1)\n—\n \n(\n1,224\n)\nTotal assets\n$\n4,924\n \n$\n894\n \nLiabilities\nMedical costs payable\n$\n701\n \n$\n179\n \nAccounts payable and other current liabilities\n834\n \n338\nOther long-term liabilities\n136\n \n504\nTotal liabilities\n$\n1,671\n \n$\n1,021\n \n(1)      \nIncludes the effect of $\n855\n million of cumulative foreign currency translation losses and $\n56\n million of noncontrolling interests.\nAs a result of continued portfolio refinement, the Company sold other businesses and assets and entered into strategic  transactions. These transactions resulted in total consideration received of $\n3.0\n billion and an additional $\n1.9\n billion of equity method investments related to the valuation of our retained interests in certain transactions. The carrying value for these transactions was $\n1.0\n billion, primarily related to goodwill. The gains from business portfolio refinement, including strategic \n64\nTable of Contents\ntransactions, were recorded within operating costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and contributed about 80 basis points ($\n3.3\n billion) to the operating cost ratio, nearly half ($\n1.4\n billion) related to Optum Health with the remainder split between UnitedHealthcare ($\n1.1\n billion) and Optum Insight ($\n800\n million). Certain transactions also included various put and call options, which were valued at $\n630\n million and included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2024 the total estimated future obligation under these arrangements if the Company decided or was required to repurchase these interests was up to $\n3.4\n billion.\n14.    \nSegment Financial Information\nFactors used to determine the Company’s reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is the Chief Executive Officer, to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes which operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The CODM uses consolidated expense information and segment earnings from operations to assess performance and determine allocation of resources.\nThe following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company’s \nfour\n reportable segments derives its revenues:\n•\nUnitedHealthcare \nincludes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. The businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for employers and individuals.

Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by Optum Rx; care delivery, care management services and certain product offerings sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Health; and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Insight. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Transactions with affiliated customers are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned so each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. \nAs a percentage of the Company’s total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were \n40\n%, \n40\n% and \n38\n% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately \n99\n%, \n97\n% and \n97\n% of consolidated total revenues for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately \n92\n% and \n82\n% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2024 \nManagement of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. \nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in the \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n, appearing under Item 9A. \n67\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  \nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries:\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated\n \nFebruary 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \nBasis for Opinion  \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2024. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nFebruary 27, 2025\n68\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B. \n    \nOTHER INFORMATION \nTrading Arrangements \nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act or under any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. \nITEM 9C.    DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot Applicable.\nPART III\nITEM  10.\n    \nDIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our directors as of February 27, 2025, including their name and principal occupation or employment:\nCharles Baker\nMichele Hooper\nPresident\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association\nLead Independent Director\nUnitedHealth Group\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nThe Directors’ Council\nTimothy Flynn\nF.
