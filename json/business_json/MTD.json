We are a leading global provider of metal detectors,      x-ray systems, checkweighers, and camera-based imaging equipment that are used in these industries. Metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself. X-ray inspection is used to detect metallic contamination in applications unsuited to metal detectors and many types of non-metallic contamination, such as glass, calcified bone, stones, and pits. Our x-ray systems are also used for mass control and for determining and controlling the fat content in meat. Checkweighers are used to control the filled weight of packaged goods such as food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Our camera-based vision inspection solutions provide in-line inspection of package quality, labels, and content, which are needs for food and beverage, consumer goods, and pharmaceutical companies.\nAll of our technologies are integrated with material handling systems to ensure the correct presentation of the customer’s product to the device and the secure rejection of non-conforming product, and are frequently designed to comply with stringent hygiene standards. Our technologies may also be used together as components of integrated packaging lines. ProdX Inspect is our quality and productivity control software for helping customers comply with regulations and optimize process efficiency, either as a stand-alone solution or through integration with the customer’s manufacturing and enterprise systems.\nRetail Weighing Solutions\nSupermarkets, hypermarkets, and other food retail businesses make use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for handling fresh goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits, or cheeses). We offer weighing and software solutions, which can integrate counter, self-service, backroom, and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food item and inventory management system. In addition, we offer weighing solutions for fast-growing areas like self-checkout and unmanned stores, as well as AI-driven image recognition solutions for fresh goods. The customer benefits of our retail solutions are in the areas of enterprise-wide device management as well as article and price management, merchandising, and regulatory compliance. In North America and select other markets, our offering also includes automated packaging and labeling solutions for the meat backroom, which are fully integrated with the scales in the store. The retail business accounted for approximately 5% of our net sales in 2024, 6% in 2023, and 5% in 2022.\n7\nTable of Contents\nCustomers and Distribution\nOur principal customers include companies in the following key end-markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and biotech companies, as well as independent research organizations and testing labs); food manufacturers; chemical, specialty chemicals, and cosmetics companies; the academic community; food retailers; the transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; and the electronics industry.\nOur products are sold through a variety of distribution channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force, while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels. A significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated through indirect channels, including sales of our Ohaus-branded products. Ohaus-branded products target markets, such as the educational market, in which customers are interested in lower cost, a more limited set of features, and less comprehensive support and service.\nWe have a diversified customer base, with no single end-customer accounting for more than 1% of 2024 net sales.\nSales and Service\nMarket Organizations\nWe maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service. The market organizations are customer-focused, with an emphasis on building and maintaining value-added relationships with customers in our target market segments. Each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions. Market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations (described below) by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives, new product and application ideas, and information about key market segments.\nWe have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers we compete against. At December 31, 2024, our sales and service group consisted of approximately 9,000 employees in sales, marketing and customer service (including related administration), and post-sales technical service, located in approximately 40 countries. This field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe. This is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach.\nService\nOur service business continues to be successful with a focus on providing uptime and calibration services, as well as further expanding our offerings to provide value-added services for a range of market needs, including regulatory compliance, performance enhancements, application expertise and training, and remote services. We have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting the use of our instruments in compliance with FDA and other international regulations, and we can provide these services to most customers’ locations around the world. Our global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets. We estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world. Service (representing service contracts, on-demand services, and replacement parts) accounted for approximately 24% of our net sales in 2024, 23% in 2023, and 20% in 2022.\n8\nTable of Contents\nBeyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention. The close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base allow us to be the trusted advisor of our customers, which provides us with high-quality sales opportunities as well as innovative product and application ideas.\nResearch and Development and Manufacturing\nProducing Organizations\nOur research, product development, and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations. Our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs, improve customer focus, and maintain technological leadership. The producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations. We also have regional logistics hubs to satisfy customer delivery requirements while optimizing our logistics processes.\nResearch and Development\nWe continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications. Over the last three years, we have invested $551 million in research and development ($189 million in 2024, $185 million in 2023, and $177 million in 2022), which is approximately 5% of net sales for each year. Our research and development efforts fall into three categories:\n•\ntechnology advancements, which generate new products or features and increase the value of our products. These advancements may be in the form of enhanced or new functionality, new applications for our technologies, more accurate or reliable measurement, additional software capability, or automation through robotics or other means.\n•\napplications development to complement our products and provide complete solutions to our customers.\n•\ncost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our products through better overall design and/or improve the ease of serviceability.\nWe devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development. This includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments, application-specific software, and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing IT systems. We closely integrate research and development with marketing, manufacturing, and product engineering. We have approximately 1,600 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe.\nManufacturing\nWe are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally located in China, Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. We emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations, and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications. We use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process. All major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001 certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand. \nWe generally manufacture critical components, which are components that contain proprietary technology. When outside manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with other manufacturers for certain non-proprietary components. We use a wide range of suppliers. We believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of \n9\nTable of Contents\nmaterials. From time to time, we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component. Supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally.\nBacklog; Seasonality\nOur manufacturing turnaround time is generally short, which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products. Backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically not longer than one to two months.\nOur business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory instruments business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than, sales in the second and third quarters. Prior to 2023, fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 27% to 30% of our net sales. This trend has a somewhat greater effect on earnings before taxes than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters. Quarterly seasonality in 2023 and 2024 was impacted by shipping delays at our European Logistics facility in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was recovered in the first quarter of 2024.\nEmployees\nOur total global workforce was approximately 17,300, consisting of 16,000 employees and 1,300 temporary personnel, as of December 31, 2024, and includes approximately 6,200 in Europe, 4,800 in North and South America, and 6,300 in Asia and other countries. \nWe are proud of our corporate culture and our talented employees. We endeavor to continue to provide an attractive work environment and keep our employees fully engaged. We know that our future success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining the best employees. We promote equal opportunity and inclusiveness worldwide and value diversity in our global workforce, which reflects the diversity in the many communities in which we operate internationally. We employ people of more than 100 nationalities. \nWe promote diversity and we encourage all employees, inclusive of all our demographics, to take on more responsibilities and management positions. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 36% of our global employee headcount was female, with approximately 29% holding management positions. We place great emphasis on performance management, training, and developing our employees across all levels and regions. During 2024, approximately 93% of employees completed one or more training courses, including part-time and temporary personnel. Lastly, we have local safety programs in place in all relevant units, and select locations have implemented a certified work safety management system. Severe workplace accidents are rare and there has been one fatality from an occupational incident related to a motor vehicle accident in the past five years.\nWe believe our employee relations are good, and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years. Approximately 8,000 employees are represented by collective bargaining or another arrangement organized to represent employee interests.\nSustainability\nSustainability touches all aspects of our business, from designing, sourcing, and producing our products, to selling and delivering them to our customers, to handling them at the end of their lifecycle. A sustainable mindset helps guide us to make the right decisions for our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate our business. We want to manage our business sustainably to position the Company for long-term growth. More than 15 years ago, we launched our GreenMT program to pursue environmental, social, and governance priorities where we can have a significant positive impact. We do this in five key areas: (1) keeping our operations sustainable over the \n10\nTable of Contents\nlong term by ensuring we use resources efficiently, (2) helping our customers to be sustainable in their businesses by offering sustainable products and services, (3) promoting responsible practices within our supply chain, (4) ensuring an engaged workforce through fair, attractive, safe, and development-minded workplaces (see Employees section above), and (5) following corporate governance best practices. \nWe have set a number of goals relating to our GreenMT sustainability program, including reducing our carbon footprint and other environmental, social, and governance goals. As an example, as of 2020, we achieved carbon neutrality with respect to Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO\n2\n emissions by realizing efficiency improvements, sourcing 100% renewable electricity for all our operations, and using offsets. We also have goals relating to waste, including reducing our waste intensity by 20% and achieving zero waste to landfill, in each case by 2025. Furthermore, we are committed to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Our commitment includes near-term and long-term net-zero targets approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). As a further example, we pursue several goals related to supply chain transparency including risk assessments and targeted supplier audits. We report annually on our progress related to sustainability topics in our Corporate Responsibility Report, available on www.mt.com/sustainability. \nBlue Ocean Program\nBlue Ocean refers to our program to establish a global operating model with standardized, automated, and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency. It encompasses an enterprise architecture, with a global, single-instance ERP system. Within our IT systems, we continue to move toward integrated, homogeneous applications and common data structures. We also are largely standardizing our key business processes. The implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multi-year period. We have implemented the Blue Ocean program in our operations in the U.S., China, most of Asia Pacific, and most of Europe. We estimate that we have more than 90% of our users on the program, and we will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years.\nIntellectual Property\nWe hold over 5,400 patents and trademarks (including pending applications), primarily in the United States, Switzerland, China, the European Union, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and India. Our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations, some of which are protected by patents of various durations. Products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents, and as a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. We have numerous trademarks, including the Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our business. We regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property.\nRegulation\nOur products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations.\nApprovals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments. In addition, some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications, in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required. Although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets, there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards, and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the European Union.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOur products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory customers are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), pharmaceutical customers to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, and customers in food processing industries may be subject to Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations.\nIn addition, certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCompetition\nOur markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established in their markets. For example, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own. In addition, some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which, although relatively small in size today, could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets.\nWe expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices. Although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track record of technological innovation; our comprehensive, high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service offering; our large installed base of instruments; and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region, product range, application, and customer. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, customer service and support, and operational excellence throughout our supply chain. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying, developing, and maintaining any competitive advantages.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself, application support, service support, and price. In emerging markets, where there is greater \n12\nTable of Contents\ndemand for less sophisticated products, price is a more important factor than in developed markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well.\nCompany Website and Information\nYou can find our website on the internet at \nwww.mt.com\n.

    "item1a": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors \nFactors Affecting Our Future Operating Results\nOperational Risks\nWe sell primarily to companies in developed countries. An economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating results.\nMost of our business is derived from companies in developed countries. Economic uncertainty in many parts of the world, including the impact of high inflationary environments and governmental monetary policies and related interest rates to combat inflation, the war in Ukraine, continuing conflicts in the Middle East, international trade disputes, tariffs, and sovereign debt levels in the European Union and the United States, are situations that we monitor closely. If developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession, we could see the following effects:\n•\na drop in demand for our products; \n•\ncompanies being unable to finance their businesses; \n•\ndifficulty in obtaining materials and supplies; \n•\npotential devaluation and/or impairment of assets;\n•\ndifficulty in collecting accounts receivables; \n•\nan increase in accounts receivable write-offs; and\n•\ngreater foreign exchange rate volatility affecting our profitability and cash flow.\nEconomic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures. Customers may also purchase lower-cost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve. These conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business.\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations, including our significant concentration of business in China and ongoing developments related to Russia, Ukraine, and the Middle East.\nWe conduct business in many countries, including emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings. In addition to the currency risks discussed below, our international operations pose other potential substantial risks and problems for us, including the following:\n•\nrecently reduced market demand in our core segments in China and the current economic conditions in this region;\n•\nlocal tariffs and trade barriers and the potential for retaliatory tariffs;\n•\nadditions or revisions to a country's legal and regulatory requirements;\n•\ndifficulties in staffing and managing local operations and/or mandatory salary increases;\n•\ncredit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local customers and distributors;\n•\ndifficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n•\nnationalization of private enterprises which may result in the confiscation of assets, as we hold significant assets around the world in the form of property, plant, and equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable, as well as $13.9 million of cash at December 31, 2024, in our Chinese subsidiaries;\n•\nrestrictions on investments and/or limitations regarding foreign ownership;\n14\nTable of Contents\n•\nadverse tax consequences, including tax disputes and imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n•\ndomestic purchasing requirements that could favor local competition;\n•\nother uncertain local economic, political, and social conditions, including inflation, hyper-inflation, and other decreases in purchasing power, or periods of low or no productivity growth; \n•\nreduced foreign investment and/or demand;\n•\ncredit tightening or reduction in credit availability for local customers;\n•\ngeopolitical topics within Asia and other regions; and\n•\nemerging markets can be volatile and change quickly.\nChina represents a significant portion of our business and financial results and has an important role in our global supply chain. For example, our Chinese operations accounted for 16% of sales to external customers, 29% of total segment profit, and approximately 30% of our global production during 2024. In recent years, geopolitical tensions have increased, particularly between the United States and China. Among other issues, these geopolitical topics have resulted in increased tariffs and trade restrictions. The Chinese government and other governments have also increased their focus on domestic purchasing requirements. In addition, due to increasing political tensions and potential tariff increases, many companies are seeking increased flexibility in their supply chains that may result in reduced foreign investment in China. The Chinese economy remains under pressure and is impacted by challenges with the country's real estate market that affects domestic consumption and has historically been a source of funds for government stimulus. These risks, all of which will be exacerbated by trade wars and tariffs, could lead to reduced sales in China, as well as higher costs.\nAfter benefiting from significant growth in 2022 and 2021, market demand in China declined significantly during the second half of 2023, which continued in 2024. Our business is significantly impacted by market demand in our core segments of pharma/biopharmaceutical, food manufacturing, and chemical. Market conditions also can be volatile and change quickly, as experienced in 2023.\nWe must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies. For example, we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in China into other currencies and to repatriate these funds. If we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations or these regulations are amended to make it more difficult to repatriate the funds, we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in China.\nWe are required to comply with various import, export control, and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners, and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. We address below the topic of economic sanctions laws related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which commenced in February 2022. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies, and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. Failure to comply with any regulations and sanctions could result in civil and criminal actions, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation.\nIn response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the U.S., European Union, and other countries imposed economic sanctions on Russian entities, while Russia enacted countermeasures. We continue to monitor developments and applicable sanctions.\nSince February 2022, we have suspended all shipments to Russia. In 2021, Russia and Ukraine accounted for approximately 1% of our net sales, and as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our assets \n15\nTable of Contents\nand liabilities in both countries remained immaterial. We also do not have manufacturing in Russia or Ukraine.\nThe EU Council has been working to expand renewable energy use, reduce consumption, and diversify energy sources due to reduced Russian energy supplies. This may impact energy availability and costs in Europe.\nWe do not manufacture in the Middle East and sales in the region account for less than 1% of total revenue. Ongoing conflicts may impact demand locally and globally while disrupting supply chains, increasing costs, and reducing shipping capacity, all of which could affect our financial results and customer demand. Escalating global conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East, have heightened economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\nEstimating the impact of ongoing global conflicts on supply chain disruptions and energy shortages is challenging. However, the Ukraine invasion and Middle East conflict could negatively affect our financial results and pose risks to our business. Additionally, uncertainties surrounding these conflicts persist, and their effects on the global economy and market conditions can change rapidly.\nWe continue to monitor developments in these conflicts and any related sanctions.\nOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a cybersecurity attack.\nWe rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders, support our customers, and bill, collect, and make payments. Our internally developed system and processes, as well as those provided by third-party vendors, may be susceptible to damage or interruption from cybersecurity incidents, such as terrorist or hacker attacks, the introduction of malicious computer viruses, ransomware, falsification of banking and other information, insider risk, or other security breaches. If there is a cybersecurity incident, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of assets or data, or reduced functionality. Many of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for every eventuality a cybersecurity incident could cause. Security breaches of our systems which allow inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information and misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, customers, or suppliers could result in our suffering significant financial and reputational damage.\nCustomers may use our products and/or software to generate or manage critical information. Though we take steps to ensure our products and/or software are secure, it is possible that a cyber attack could result in the loss or compromise of critical information. If a customer alleges that a cyber attack causes or contributes to a loss or compromise of critical information, whether or not caused by us, we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition.\nThe techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber attacks and compromise information technology infrastructure, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for some time. In addition, there has been an increase in state-sponsored cyber attacks which are often conducted by capable, well-funded groups. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies amplify these concerns. \nWhile we attempt to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of proactive measures, including mandatory quarterly ongoing employee training and awareness, technical security controls, enhanced data protection, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe our mitigation measures reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Despite any precautions we may take, a cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation and \n16\nTable of Contents\nfinancial condition and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to respond to such events. Our cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or asset or data loss as a result of cybersecurity incidents. \nIn addition, regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection worldwide, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation which went into effect in May 2018, may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products or services. We expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement. If we violate or fail to comply with such regulatory or legislative requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned, and such fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, support our customers, fulfill orders, and bill, collect, and make payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, malicious employees or employee negligence, computer viruses, and other events. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data, or reduced functionality. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Any interaction with third-party systems increases cyber-attack risks. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, fraudulent or negligent loss of assets, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures.\nCustomers may use our products and/or software to generate or manage confidential information. Though we take steps to ensure our products and/or software are secure, it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products. If a customer alleges system failures in our products and/or software cause or contribute to a loss, whether or not caused by us, we could face harm to our reputation and our financial condition and legal liability.\nWe have also been implementing our Blue Ocean program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a Company-wide enterprise resource planning system. This has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multi-year period. We have implemented the program in our operations in the U.S., China, most of Asia Pacific, and most of Europe. We estimate that we have more than 90% of our users on the program and will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years. If our implementation is flawed, we could suffer interruptions in operations and customer-facing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data, experience reduced functionality, or have delays in reporting financial information. In addition, the program has increased our reliance on a single information technology system, which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption.\nOur ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted.\nWe have key manufacturing facilities located in China, Europe, and the United States. Many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. In addition, a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers, in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties. If we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason, such as global supply chain and production issues, changes in third-party service providers, pandemics, strikes or other labor unrest, labor shortages, power interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, fire, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, rising water levels, other weather events or natural disasters (including the potential impacts of climate change), or other events beyond our control, \n17\nTable of Contents\nwe may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services resulting in lost sales. It may be expensive to resolve these issues, even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies. More importantly, customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption.\nOur business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material.\nWe purchase most of our raw materials, components, and supplies from multiple suppliers. Some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply, and disruption of these sources whether as a result of issues with our suppliers' operation or the timely availability of shipments from freight carriers could affect our ability to manufacture products. Even where multiple sources of materials and components are available, the quality of the alternative materials, regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing, and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales. If we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time, this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, sales and marketing, customer service and support, and operational excellence throughout our supply chain to ensure that our products do not become technologically obsolete over time. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments. In developing new products, we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability. \nIn addition, as we develop new products and services, we could be required to comply with additional regulations. If we fail to comply with the new regulations, it could affect the launch of the new product and service, in particular, and our company, as a whole. For instance, it is expected that laws and regulations around the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools will increase over the next few years, but it is unknown at this time what these laws and regulations will address and how and whether they will be adopted globally. As we introduce AI and machine learning into our technology platform (as well as those of our customers through provision of our services), we could become subject to these new regulations, which may be difficult to comply with. Some of our competitors may not be required to comply, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, challenges with properly managing the use of AI could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of operations. Further, if we fail to adopt these new technologies, we may face price pressure from competitors using lower-cost AI systems.\nAs a result, we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control, which could harm our business.\nWe sell some products through third parties, including distributors and value-added resellers. This exposes us to various risks, including competitive pressure, concentration of sales volumes, credit risks, and compliance risks. We may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings. Distributors may also face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivables. Violations of the FCPA or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could materially impact our business. In addition to financial risk, the actions of some of our distributors could cause \n18\nTable of Contents\nreputational harm, especially if our products are involved. Risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nDepartures of key employees could impair our operations.\nKey employees could leave the Company. If any key employees stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed. Important R&D personnel may leave and join competitors, which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects. We have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives.\nA pandemic or widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business, making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers, and could result in reduced demand from our customers.\nOur operations are vulnerable to global events, including pandemics like COVID-19. Despite precautions, such outbreaks can lead to business shutdowns, illness, quarantines, and workforce disruptions. Events in key regions such as North America, Europe, or China could significantly impact commercial activity, adversely affecting our financial condition, operations, and prospects.\nIf operations are curtailed, we may need alternative suppliers or staff, which could be more expensive, unavailable, or cause shipment delays, impacting results. A disruption in product design could delay new product introductions, while affected customers may reduce or delay purchases, further impacting our operations.\nOur business involves certain operating risks, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured losses or liabilities we might incur in our operations. \nWe have procured various insurance policies for certain types of insurance coverage and in varying coverage amounts. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. We also are subject to the risk that we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at a reasonable cost. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were uninsured or for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nStrategic Risks\nA prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharma/biopharmaceutical, food manufacturing, and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results. A reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales.\nOur products are used extensively in the pharma/biopharmaceutical, food manufacturing, and chemical industries. We recently experienced reduced demand in these segments, which negatively impacted our net sales in 2023 and 2024. Market demand in pharma/biopharmaceutical was particularly impacted in 2023 after significant growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consolidation in these industries also hurt our sales in the past. A prolonged global economic downturn, a downturn affecting one or more of these industries, or consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control, including the resources available for purchasing equipment, the spending priorities among various types of equipment, and policies regarding capital expenditures. Any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could \n19\nTable of Contents\nharm our profitability. Changes in governmental regulations or a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers’ ability to purchase our products.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins, gain market share, and maintain a technological advantage.\nOur markets are highly competitive. Many are fragmented both geographically and by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established in their markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own. There has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years. Any consolidation within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own. Some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which, although relatively small in size today, could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins. \nWe also expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices. If tariffs are implemented and we cannot pass on the increased costs to our customers, our margins could be impacted as we work to remain competitive. In addition, our competitors are expected to continue to improve their technology infrastructure, as well as the technology services offered to their customers, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, to interact with suppliers, sell their products and services, and support and grow their customer base. Our ability to innovate our own technology infrastructure and appropriately address user experience could affect our ability to compete.  Although we believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages. \nWe may face risks associated with future acquisitions.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines, technologies, or businesses, but these involve risks such as integration challenges, management distractions, and potential loss of key employees. Future acquisitions may also lead to stock issuances that dilute current shareholders, increased debt and liabilities, and higher amortization expenses for intangible assets. Any of these risks could materially impact our profitability.\nLarger companies are increasingly targeting life sciences and instruments, potentially altering market competition. Additionally, we may face challenges in identifying, completing, or integrating future acquisitions, and even successful acquisitions may not positively impact our business or results. We must also estimate the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, relying on valuation models with inherent uncertainties and our judgment regarding certain assumptions.\nFinancial Risks \nCurrency fluctuations affect our operating profits.\nOur earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the Swiss franc, euro, Chinese renminbi, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings \n20\nTable of Contents\ngo down. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our earnings also go down. We estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately $2.4 million to $2.7 million annually.\nWe also conduct business throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of these currency exposures is the Chinese renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1% against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately $2.3 million to $2.6 million annually.  \nIn addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and the euro. Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2024, we estimate that a 5% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of $39.0 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.\nInflation can impact our operating results and the global economy.\nInflation affects the costs of goods and services that we use, including raw materials to manufacture our products, as well as transportation and logistical costs and other external costs and services. Inflation also affects labor costs, which are a significant element of our overall cost structure. If these costs cannot be passed on to customers, our margins could be reduced.\nInflation also leads to increased interest rates as country monetary policies combat inflation. This can result in reduced economic growth and recessionary conditions, as well as higher borrowing costs.\nGlobal inflation significantly increased in 2022 and 2021 related to the COVID-19 economic recovery and associated disruptions in global demand, supply chains/logistics, and labor markets, as well as the war in Ukraine and related significant increase in energy costs. While the global inflation rate began to ease in 2023 and 2024 as a result of central bank policy tightening, core inflation has proved persistent as a result of the preceding factors, in addition to others such as the escalating number of significant geopolitical conflicts throughout the world. \nThese inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results in future years. The pace of inflationary changes can also occur more quickly than our ability to respond with corresponding price increases and cost optimization or reduction measures. In addition, there may be differences in inflation rates between countries where we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries where we sell products, which may limit our ability to recover increased costs. The competitive environment in which we operate may also limit our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices.\nHistorically, we also have experienced higher inflation in China, Eastern Europe, India, and Brazil. To date, these inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results. However, given our presence in China, Eastern Europe, India, and Brazil, these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results.\nWe may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $668.9 million and other intangible assets of $257.1 million.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense. We make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The evaluation may be based on valuation models that estimate fair value. In preparing the valuation models, we consider a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic conditions, future cash flows, and transaction and market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses. The significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates, and discount rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets.\nShould any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash flows, including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.\nOur amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change.\nConcerns regarding the Eurozone debt levels and market perception related to the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits.\nWe conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency (the Eurozone). In the past, there have been concerns regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations. In addition, concerns in the past have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. \nThese concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this type of financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and, more specifically, on the ability of our Company, our customers, suppliers, and lenders to finance their respective businesses and to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies and materials, and on the demand for our products. For information on the impact of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, see \"Risk Factors — Changes in foreign laws and legal systems could adversely impact our results of operations.\"\nLegal, Tax, Regulatory, and Other Risks\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions. Our \n22\nTable of Contents\neffective tax rates and tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or rates (including the potential implementation of various U.S. tax proposals), changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and material adjustments from tax audits. \nIn particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.\nOur tax expense and tax obligations could increase as a result of changing the application of tax law. \nGovernments are facing greater pressure on public finances, which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations. Governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations. \nThe Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) has proposed changes to the current transfer pricing arm’s length standard for allocating profit as well as a 15% minimum tax by jurisdiction. While the provision to alter the way profit is allocated by jurisdiction is not expected to impact the Company, the 15% minimum tax by jurisdiction may adversely impact the Company's global tax provision. \nAny changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations, on repatriation of dividends, earnings, share repurchases, or capital, or on transfer pricing, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden, which would negatively affect our profitability. Potential OECD changes impacting consumer businesses could also have an unfavorable effect on some of our key customer segments such as pharmaceutical and food manufacturing, which could result in a decline or delay in capital spending by our customers and a resulting decline in our revenues and profitability. \nWe may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations. \nOur products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products, including design and development, product safety, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, and distribution. We also operate a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets where we do business, including those relating to competition, employment and labor practices, international trade, and corruption. If we fail to comply with these regulations, or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practices or impose new burdens, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be subject to investigation costs, reputational harm, fines, criminal prosecution, and other damages that could impact our profitability. \nIn June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Chevron doctrine, ending judicial deference to regulatory agencies. This shift could significantly impact environmental regulation, consumer protection, advertising, privacy, artificial intelligence, and other regulatory frameworks we must comply with. This may impact our ability to operate our business in the manner in which we are accustomed and could negatively impact how we market our offerings, and could increase our regulatory compliance expense, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. Political policies in the U.S., China, the U.K., Canada, and Europe may affect global trade, domestic purchasing, or create uncertainty. In recent years, the U.S. government has taken a new approach to trade policy, renegotiating or potentially terminating agreements and imposing tariffs, particularly on \n23\nTable of Contents\nChinese goods. These tariffs could raise the cost of our products, components, and raw materials, impacting our gross margin. Higher prices may also reduce competitiveness and consumer demand.\nU.S. trade policy under the new administration, including potential new or increased tariffs, along with trade policies in China, Mexico, the U.K., Canada, and parts of Europe, may impact global trade and create uncertainty, potentially harming our business. Additionally, before taking office, President Trump pledged to impose 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports in his first year. In response, foreign governments, including China, have enacted retaliatory tariffs and domestic purchasing requirements favoring local competition, which could reduce our sales.\nThe various trade policy and regulatory actions described above may restrict our access to lower-cost countries in certain circumstances or otherwise create uncertainty, negatively impact global markets, and make it more difficult or costly for us to import our products into certain countries. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies could also lead to an economic downturn, increased inflation, and/or could create unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates (see above description \"Currency fluctuations affect our operating profits.\"). In times of uncertainty, some customers delay investments or defer normal replacement cycles, which could have an adverse impact on our sales. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs, trade agreements, or policies have the potential to adversely impact our business and financial performance. \nChanges in foreign laws and legal systems could adversely impact our results of operations.\n Following Brexit, the E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) took effect on May 1, 2021, allowing tariff-free and quota-free trade. However, additional inspections and documentation requirements may cause delays at ports, potentially disrupting our supply chain and affecting delivery schedules.\nUncertainty remains regarding the U.K.'s future relationship with the E.U. and the interpretation of the TCA, with Brexit-related issues likely to take years to resolve. While the full impact on our business is uncertain, Brexit could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others, our operating results could be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain, maintain, and enforce patents on our technology, maintain our trademarks, and protect our trade secrets. Our patents may not provide complete protection or may expire, and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents. Our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed. We may experience a decline in sales and/or profitability if any of these things occur. Competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand. Improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur.\nWe may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome, and management attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such litigation, we may have to pay damages, stop the infringing activity, and/or obtain a license. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to sell some of our products, which could result in a decline in our revenues.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations. For instance, federal, international, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies are increasingly focused on combating and/or limiting the effects of climate change \n24\nTable of Contents\nthrough a variety of means, including regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, implementing policies mandating or promoting the use of renewable or zero-carbon energy and sustainability initiatives, and additional taxes on fuel and energy. We have corporate programs in place to manage compliance and stakeholder expectations related to environmental matters, but increasing public interest in climate change topics may result in the enactment of additional governmental laws and regulations related to this subject area. Such increased compliance burdens and costs could disrupt the sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution of our products and adversely affect our business, and financial condition, or results in operations. We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination in various facilities. In addition, some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future. These sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition.\nClimate change, or the effects of climate change, may negatively affect us.\nClimate change risks and evolving stakeholder expectations could negatively impact our business. Climate-related changes may increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as extreme weather events, wildfires, rising temperatures, and shifting precipitation patterns. These disruptions could affect our suppliers' ability to fulfill contracts due to workforce and infrastructure challenges, impacting material availability and costs. Additionally, rising insurance and operating expenses from climate-related disruptions could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain, including conflict minerals.\nThe SEC has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold, known as conflict minerals. Companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we have incurred additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, due diligence procedures we have implemented to understand the origins of the minerals we use in our operations may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are DRC conflict free, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers and other stakeholders who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and/or lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at prices similar to the past, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nFuture laws, regulations, or customers may make additional demands on our supply chain, including more transparency into the activities of our suppliers with regard to human rights and sustainable sourcing. We have significant protections in place to ensure we partner with responsible suppliers, but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs. If we cannot satisfy customers’ demands, we may lose business, and if we cannot meet new regulatory requirements, we may have to alter our sourcing at increased expense.\n25\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program, planned capital expenditures, and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash in the future. This is subject to factors beyond our control, including general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, governmental, and other factors described in this section.\nWe cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our credit facility and the senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows. Changes in governmental cash repatriation policies, restrictions, or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program.\nRisks Related to Our Debt\nWe have debt and we may incur substantially more debt, which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.\nWe have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2024, we had a total indebtedness of approximately $2.0 billion, net of cash of $59.4 million. Our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness.\nThe existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences. For example, it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments; and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development, and other corporate requirements; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in raw material costs; limit our ability to respond to business opportunities; limit our ability to borrow additional funds, which may be necessary; and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants, which, if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured, could result in an event of default under our debt instruments.\nThe agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business.\nThe note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate, merge, sell, or lease all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios.\nOur ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including economic, financial, and industry conditions. The breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes and/or under our credit facility. An event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable. Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments, reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity.\nWe have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the Company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to $1.35 billion. Our credit facility is provided by a group of 13 financial institutions, which individually have between 4.4% and 11.1% of the total funding commitment. At December 31, 2024, we had borrowings of $734.7 million outstanding under our credit facility. Our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available. Even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds, if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt, such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations. This could result in us being unable to borrow the full $1.35 billion amount available.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe make forward-looking statements, and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors.\nWe provide forward-looking statements both in our filings with the SEC and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls, including guidance on anticipated sales growth and earnings per share. You should not rely on forward-looking statements to predict our actual results. Our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties.\nOur forward-looking statements may not be accurate or complete, and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results. New risks also periodically arise. Please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forward-looking statements. See in particular “Factors Affecting Our Future Operating Results” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nIn providing guidance on our future earnings, we evaluate our budgets, strategic plans, and other factors relating to our business. We make assumptions about external factors, including the following:\n•\nthe outlook for our end markets and the global economy;\n•\nthe impact of external factors on our competition;\n•\nthe financial position of our customers and their willingness to pay for our products and services;\n•\nthe estimated costs of purchasing materials;\n•\nthe estimated costs and performance of transportation and logistics, including third-party service providers;\n•\ndevelopments in personnel costs; \n•\nour estimated income tax expense; and\n•\nrates for currency exchange, particularly between the Chinese renminbi and the U.S. dollar and between the Swiss franc and the euro.\nThese assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time. For example, although no single end-customer accounts for more than 1% of our revenues, if a number of our customers experienced significant deterioration in their financial positions concurrently, it could have an impact on our results of operations.\n27\nTable of Contents\nSome of our key internal assumptions include the following:\n•\nour ability to implement our business strategy;\n•\nour ability to implement price increases as forecasted;\n•\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs such as our Spinnaker, market penetration, and Field Turbo initiatives;\n•\nthe effectiveness of our programs to improve our service business, including growth, globalization, and productivity initiatives;\n•\nour ability to develop and deliver innovative products and services;\n•\nthe continued growth of our sales in emerging markets; and\n•\nthe effectiveness of our productivity and cost-saving initiatives.\nThese internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time. For example, with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets, in certain markets, such as emerging markets, price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products and services. Furthermore, we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings. Additionally, it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs.\nWe believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes. However, should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, or should we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash flows, we may experience results different than our projections.",

Our internally developed system and processes, as well as those systems and processes provided by third-party vendors, may be susceptible to damage or interruption from cybersecurity threats, such as terrorist or hacker attacks, the introduction of malicious computer viruses, ransomware, falsification of banking and other information, insider risk, or other security breaches. Such attacks have become more and more sophisticated over the years and in some cases have been conducted or sponsored by governmental actors with significant means. \nWe have implemented robust processes to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks, including potentially material risks, related to our internal information systems, our products, and our business.\n Our Board of Directors has direct oversight of our enterprise risk management process, including the management of cybersecurity risks, as described below.\nUnder the direction and supervision of our Chief Financial Officer, we conduct an annual comprehensive enterprise risk assessment, which includes details of our management of enterprise-wide risk topics, such as those related to cybersecurity risks. \nThe Board of Directors receives the full results of the annual enterprise risk assessment, including an evaluation of cybersecurity risks we face, risks more broadly across our peers and industries, and a detailed description of the actions we have taken to mitigate these risks. \nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the results of the enterprise risk assessment in detail with management on an annual basis and reports on its review to the Board of Directors each year\n. We provide a comprehensive update to the Board of Directors on cybersecurity at least annually, and more frequently as relevant.\nOur Head of Global Supply Chain and IT, Chief Information Officer, and Head of Information Security serve on our Cybersecurity Steering Committee (the “Cyber SteCo”), along with our Chief Legal \n28\nTable of Contents\nOfficer, who reports to our Chief Executive Officer, and our Head of Financial Processes, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer. The Cyber SteCo, which meets regularly, develops and implements cybersecurity risk mitigation strategies and activities throughout the year, including the management of comprehensive incident response plans, and receives regular updates on cybersecurity-related matters.\nOur Head of Global Supply Chain and IT, reporting to our Chief Executive Officer, has principal responsibility for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and preparing updates for the Board of Directors.\n Our Chief Information Officer reports to our Head of Global Supply Chain and IT and is responsible for the operation of our cybersecurity program.\n \nOur Chief Information Officer is educated in business computing sciences and has over twenty years working in leadership, management, and consulting roles in digitalization, application management, and cybersecurity. Our Chief Information Officer also has experience implementing and leading global governance frameworks, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 27001.\n An Advisory Board, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Head of Global Supply Chain and IT, and Chief Information Officer, meets quarterly to discuss digital initiatives and investments, inclusive of cybersecurity topics. An experienced team of IT security professionals reports to our Chief Information Officer.\nThe Cyber SteCo oversees activities related to the monitoring, prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity risks. We have adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework to continually evaluate and enhance our cybersecurity procedures. \nActivities include mandatory quarterly online training for all employees, technical security controls, enhanced data protection, the maintenance of backup and protective systems, policy review and implementation, the evaluation and retention of cybersecurity insurance, and periodic assessments of third-party service providers to assess the cyber preparedness of key vendors.\n To enhance our threat preparedness, we perform monthly vulnerability scans, annual penetration testing with a third party, and annual disaster recovery and cyber response drills, including third-party-facilitated drills. \nWe use automated tools that monitor, detect, and prevent cybersecurity risks and have a third party operated security operations center that operates 24 hours a day to alert us to any potential cybersecurity threats\n. As noted above, our Cyber SteCo also has implemented comprehensive incident response plans that define the appropriate communication flow and response for certain categories of potential cybersecurity incidents. The Cyber SteCo escalates events, including to the Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors, as deemed necessary.\nThe Cyber SteCo oversees our engagement with reputable third parties, which we utilize in connection with our established processes to assess, identify, and manage potential and actual cybersecurity threats, to actively monitor our systems internally using widely accepted digital applications, processes, and controls, and to provide forensic assistance to facilitate system recovery in the case of an incident.\nIf there is a cybersecurity incident, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of assets or data, or reduced functionality.\n Many of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for every eventuality a cybersecurity incident could cause. Security breaches of our systems which allow inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information and misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, customers, or suppliers could result in our suffering significant financial and reputational damage. Customers may use our products and/or software to generate or manage critical information. Though we take steps to ensure our products and/or software are secure, it is possible that a cyber attack could result in the loss or compromise of critical information. If a customer alleges that a cyber attack causes or contributes to a loss or compromise of critical information, whether or not caused by us, we could face harm to our reputation \n29\nTable of Contents\nand financial condition as it could cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to respond to such events."
