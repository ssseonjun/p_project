    "item1": "Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is designed to optimize stockholder value creation through reinvestment in our businesses, dividends and share repurchases, as well as acquisitions and other business development initiatives and debt repayments, consistent with our previously stated commitment to achieve our net leverage targets.\nCapital expenditures totaled $446 million in 2024 as we continued to invest across our businesses to support future growth, including additional investments in support of new and existing product capacity expansions. Our investments in capital expenditures in 2024 were focused on projects that improve production efficiency, enhance our quality systems and optimize manufacturing capabilities to support our business growth.\nWe also continued to return value to our stockholders. During 2024, we paid cash dividends to our stockholders totaling $590 million. \n36\nFACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nHurricane Helene\nIn September 2024, Hurricane Helene, which brought significant rain and extensive flooding to Western North Carolina, caused damage to certain of our assets at our North Cove facility in Marion, N.C. and disrupted operations at that facility. As we work to fully remediate the facility, we currently expect to incur an estimated $50 million of charges in the first quarter of 2025 primarily consisting of remediation costs, air freight (as we transfer product across our global network in the interest of increasing the availability of intravenous solutions for our customers) and other charges. See Note 1 for further discussion of insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Helene.\nSupply Constraints and Global Economic Conditions\nIn recent years, we have experienced significant challenges to our global supply chain, including production delays and interruptions, increased costs and shortages of raw materials and component parts (including resins and electromechanical devices), higher transportation costs, adverse impacts from significant weather events (including Hurricane Helene and the flooding of our North Cove facility), elevated inflation levels and interest rates, disruptions to certain ports of call and access to shipping ports around the world, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, and other geopolitical events. While we have seen improvements in the availability of component parts and improved pricing in raw materials and on transportation costs, some of these challenges (including certain of those set forth above as we work to fully remediate our North Cove facility) are expected to have a negative impact on our results of operations in the future.\nOur results of operations are also affected by macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. The war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, other geopolitical events, the sanctions and other measures being imposed in response to these conflicts (and the potential for escalation of these conflicts), recently imposed or future quotas, duties or tariffs and any retaliatory counter measures, and recent political changes to trade policies, have increased the levels of economic and political uncertainty and we continue to closely monitor the developing situations. While we have substantially completed our wind down efforts related to our business in Russia, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the current scope of the war in Ukraine could have an adverse effect on our operations (including our supply chain) in the region.\nThe existence of high inflation rates in the United States and in many of the countries where we conduct business has resulted in, and may in the future result in, higher interest rates, shipping costs, labor costs, and other costs and expenses. Additionally, adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates have increased, and could continue to increase, our costs of sourcing certain raw materials in some jurisdictions. We have experienced and may in the future experience inflationary increases in manufacturing costs and operating expenses and we may not be able to pass these cost increases on to our customers in a timely manner or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations. Inflation and general macroeconomic factors have caused certain of our customers to reduce or delay orders for our products and services and could cause them to do so in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our sales and results of operations.\nAs a medical products company, our operations and many of the products manufactured or sold by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, both within and outside the United States. These regulations (as described in Item 1, Government Regulation, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) require that we obtain specific approval from FDA or applicable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before we can market and sell most of our products in a particular country. Failure to obtain or maintain those approvals or clearances (including temporary importation authorizations) could have a material adverse impact on our business (including with respect to our ability to compete in the product markets in which we currently operate). Furthermore, FDA in the United States, the EMA and MHRA in Europe, the NMPA in China, and other government agencies, inside and outside of the United States, administer requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, pricing, distribution, and post-market surveillance of our products. Our failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to various actions, including warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses, and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFor further discussion, please refer to",

diagnostic technologies; respiratory health devices; advanced equipment for the surgical space, including operating room integration technologies, precision positioning devices and other accessories; injectable pharmaceuticals; inhaled anesthetics and drug compounding services. These products are used by hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, ambulatory surgery centers, doctors’ offices, kidney dialysis centers and patients at home under physician supervision. Our global footprint and the critical nature of our products and services play a key role in expanding access to healthcare in emerging and developed countries. Our business is comprised of \nthree\n reportable segments: Medical Products & Therapies, Healthcare Systems & Technologies, and Pharmaceuticals which are described in Note 18. \nOn August 12, 2024, we entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (EPA ) with certain affiliates of Carlyle Group Inc. (Carlyle) to sell our Kidney Care business. That business, which is now known as Vantive Health LLC (Vantive) is comprised of our former Kidney Care segment and provides chronic and acute dialysis therapies and services, including peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapies, and other organ support therapies. On January 31, 2025, we completed the sale of our Kidney Care business to Carlyle for an aggregate purchase price of $\n3.80\n billion in cash, subject to certain closing cash, working capital and debt adjustments. After giving effect to certain adjustments, we received approximately $\n3.71\n billion pre-tax cash proceeds at closing of the transaction with the net after tax proceeds currently estimated to be approximately $\n3.4\n billion, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We determined that our Kidney Care business met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale in August 2024, and we also concluded that it met the conditions to be reported as a discontinued operation at that time. Accordingly, our Kidney Care business is reported in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial systems, and our prior period results have been adjusted to reflect discontinued operations presentation. See Note 2 for additional information. \nHurricane Helene\nIn September 2024, Hurricane Helene, which brought significant rain and extensive flooding to Western North Carolina, caused damage to certain of our assets at our North Cove facility in Marion, N.C. and disrupted operations at that facility. Since then, we have actively worked with our customers, regulators and other stakeholders to manage inventory and minimize disruption to patient care as we worked towards resuming our North Cove manufacturing operations. Our insurance policies generally cover the repair or replacement of our assets that suffer loss or damage, less applicable deductibles and subject to any coverage limits and exclusions. Our insurance policies also provide coverage for interruption to our business, including lost profits, and reimbursement for other expenses and costs that have been incurred relating to the damages and losses suffered. In 2024, we recorded $\n110\n million of pre-tax net charges related to damages caused by Hurricane Helene. This consisted of $\n44\n million related to the write-off of damaged inventory and fixed assets as well as $\n317\n million of remediation, idle facility, air freight and other costs offset by $\n251\n million of insurance recoveries. These amounts were recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nRisks and Uncertainties  \nSupply Constraints and Global Economic Conditions\nIn recent years, we have experienced significant challenges to our global supply chain, including production delays and interruptions, increased costs and shortages of raw materials and component parts (including resins and electromechanical devices), higher transportation costs, adverse impacts from significant weather events (including Hurricane Helene and the flooding of our North Cove facility), elevated inflation levels and interest rates, disruptions to certain ports of call and access to shipping lanes around the world, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and other geopolitical events. While we have seen improvements in the availability of component parts and \n69\nimproved pricing of raw materials and on transportation costs, some of these challenges (such as additional transportation costs resulting from Hurricane Helene as we transfer product across our global network in the interest of increasing the availability of intravenous solutions for our customers while we work to fully remediate our North Cove facility) are expected to have a negative impact on our results of operations in the future. \nWe expect that the challenges caused by global economic conditions, among other factors, may continue to have an adverse effect on our business.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Baxter and our majority-owned subsidiaries that we control, after elimination of intra-company balances and transactions.\n \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in the contract. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Some of our contracts have multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Our global payment terms are typically between \n30\n-\n90\n days.\nOur primary customers are hospitals, healthcare distribution companies and government agencies that purchase healthcare products on behalf of providers. Most of our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. This includes sales of our broad portfolio of essential healthcare products across our business segments. We earn revenues from sterile IV solutions; infusion systems and devices; parenteral nutrition therapies; inhaled anesthetics; generic injectable pharmaceuticals; surgical hemostat and sealant products, smart bed systems; patient monitoring and diagnostic technologies; respiratory health devices; and advanced equipment for the surgical space. For most of those offerings, our performance obligation is satisfied upon delivery to the customer. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation.\nTo a lesser extent, we enter into arrangements for which revenue may be recognized over time. For example, we lease medical equipment to customers under operating lease arrangements and recognize the related revenues on a monthly basis over the lease term. Our Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment includes connected care solutions and collaboration tools that are implemented over time. We recognize revenue for these arrangements over time or at a point in time depending on our evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the promised goods or services. We also earn revenue from contract manufacturing activities, which is recognized over time as the services are performed. Revenue is recognized over time when we are creating or enhancing an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced or our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $\n5.47\n billion of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations related to executed contracts with an original duration of more than one year, which are primarily included in the Medical Product and Therapies segments. Some contracts in the United States included in this amount contain index-dependent price increases, which are not known at this time. We expect to recognize approximately \n25\n% of this amount as revenue in 2025, \n20\n% in 2026, \n20\n% in 2027, \n35\n% in 2028 and the remainder thereafter.\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration, primarily related to rebates and distributor chargebacks. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and as reductions of accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Management's estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, \n70\nthese reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract using the expected value method. The amount of variable consideration included in the net sales price is limited to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal in revenue will not occur when the related uncertainty is resolved. Revenue recognized in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was not material. Additionally, our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and determining the allocation of the transaction price may require significant judgment.\nPractical Expedients \nWe apply a practical expedient to expense as incurred costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been \none year\n or less. We do not disclose the value of the transaction price that is allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of less than \none year\n. We have elected to use the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if it is expected, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be \none year\n or less. Additionally, all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected from a customer are excluded from revenue.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIn the normal course of business, we provide credit to our customers, perform credit evaluations of these customers and maintain reserves for potential credit losses. In determining the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider, among other items, historical credit losses, the past-due status of receivables, payment histories, other customer-specific information, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable future forecasts. Receivables are written off when we determine that they are uncollectible.\n \nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping costs incurred to physically move product from our premises to the customer’s premises are classified as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Handling costs, which are costs incurred to store, move and prepare products for shipment, are classified as cost of sales. Approximately $\n382\n million in 2024, $\n358\n million in 2023 and $\n388\n million in 2022 of shipping costs were classified in SG&A expenses.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include cash, certificates of deposit and money market and other short-term funds with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash represents cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. We review inventories on hand at least quarterly and record provisions for estimated excess, slow-moving and obsolete inventory, as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from \n20\n to \n50\n years for buildings and improvements and from \n3\n to \n15\n years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included within machinery and equipment and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from \nthree\n to \nfive years\n.\n \n71\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development (R&D) costs, including R&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations, are expensed as incurred. Pre-regulatory approval contingent milestone obligations to counterparties in collaborative arrangements, which include acquired R&D, are expensed when the milestone is probable to be achieved. Contingent milestone payments made to such counterparties on or after regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangible assets, net.\nAcquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) is the value assigned to technology or products under development acquired in a business combination which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. Acquired IPR&D is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the related technology or product, subject to annual impairment reviews as discussed below. If the R&D project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nWe periodically enter into collaborative arrangements in the normal course of business. These collaborative arrangements take a number of forms and structures and are designed to enhance and expedite long-term sales and profitability growth. These arrangements may provide for us to obtain commercialization rights to a product under development, and require us to make upfront payments, contingent milestone payments, profit-sharing, and/or royalty payments. We may be responsible for ongoing costs associated with the arrangements, including R&D cost reimbursements to the counterparty. See the Research and Development section of this note regarding the accounting treatment of upfront and contingent milestone payments. Any royalty and profit-sharing payments during the commercialization phase are expensed as cost of sales when they become due and payable.\nRestructuring Charges\nWe record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. Employee termination costs are primarily recorded when actions are probable and estimable. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. Refer to the discussion below regarding the accounting for asset impairment charges.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value (or other measurement attribute required by U.S. GAAP) of acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination. Management performs an impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount. We have the option to assess goodwill for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required to be performed. If we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we do not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  In the quantitative impairment test, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount that its carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the fair values of our reporting units are generally determined based on a discounted cash flow model (an income approach) and earnings multiples (a market approach). Significant assumptions in reporting unit fair value measurements generally include revenue growth rates, forecasted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins, discount rates, terminal growth rates and earnings multiples. Each of those assumptions can significantly affect the fair values of our reporting units. \nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as IPR&D acquired in business combinations and certain trade names with indefinite lives, are subject to an impairment review annually in the fourth quarter and whenever indicators of impairment exist. We have the option to assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first performing \n72\nqualitative assessments to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the carrying amounts. If we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if we elect not to perform an initial qualitative assessment, we then perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying amount down to the fair value.\nWe review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets used in operations, other than goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating recoverability, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level such that the identifiable cash flows relating to the group are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We then compare the carrying amounts of the assets or asset groups with the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. In the event an asset (or asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) exceeds its fair value.\nLong-lived assets are classified as held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its present condition and the sale is probable of being completed within one year of the balance sheet date. Assets held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortized and they are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nSee Notes 3 and 5 for further information about impairments of goodwill and intangible assets recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\nInvestments in debt securities classified as available-for-sale are measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive (loss) income (OCI). Investments in marketable equity securities are classified as other non-current assets and are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other (income) expense, net. We have elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. As such, our non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are also recognized in other (income) expense, net. Noncontrolling investments in common stock or in-substance common stock are accounted for under the equity method if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. We review our investments in debt and equity securities for impairment and adjust impaired investments to fair value through earnings, as required.\n \nIncome Taxes\nDeferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. We maintain valuation allowances unless it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. With respect to uncertain tax positions, we determine whether the position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. Any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The liability relating to uncertain tax positions is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheets to the extent that we anticipate making a payment within one year. Interest and penalties associated with income taxes are classified in the income tax expense (benefit) line in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nForeign Currency Translation\nCumulative translation adjustments (CTA) related to foreign operations are included in OCI. For foreign operations in highly inflationary economies, translation gains and losses are included in other (income) expense, net, and were not material in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as short-term or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. We designate \n73\ncertain of our derivatives and foreign-currency denominated debt as hedging instruments in cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges.\nFor each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCI and then recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flow hedges are classified in cost of sales and interest expense, net, and are primarily related to forecasted intra-company sales denominated in foreign currencies and forecasted interest payments on anticipated issuances of debt, respectively.\nFor each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets changes in fair value attributable to a particular risk, such as changes in interest rates, of the hedged item, which are also recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of hedge instruments designated as fair value hedges are classified in interest expense, net, as they hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain of our fixed-rate debt.\nWe have designated certain of our Euro-denominated senior notes as hedges of our net investment in our European operations and, as a result, mark to spot rate adjustments on the outstanding debt balances are recorded as a component of AOCI.\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, the change in fair value is recorded directly to other (income) expense, net.\nIf it is determined that a derivative or nonderivative hedging instrument is no longer highly effective as a hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Gains or losses relating to terminations of effective cash flow hedges generally continue to be deferred and are recognized consistent with the loss or income recognition of the underlying hedged items. However, if it is probable that the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur, any gains or losses would be immediately reclassified from AOCI to earnings. If we terminate a fair value hedge, an amount equal to the cumulative fair value adjustment to the hedged item at the date of termination is amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the hedged item. If we remove a net investment hedge designation, any gain or loss recognized in AOCI are not reclassified to earnings until we sell, liquidate, or deconsolidate the foreign investments that were being hedged.\nCash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. Cash flows for all other derivatives, including those that are not designated as a hedge, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently issued accounting standards not yet adopted\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires disaggregated disclosure of certain expenses on an interim and annual basis in the notes to the financial statements. This standard is effective for annual consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2027 and for interim periods beginning in 2028. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires (1) disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Additionally, the amendment requires disclosure of certain disaggregated information about income taxes paid, income from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) and income tax expense (benefit). The standard is effective for our annual consolidated financial \n74\nstatements for the year ending December 31, 2025. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\n \nAs of January 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires enhanced disclosures about segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. This standard became effective for our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for interim periods beginning in 2025. See Note 18 for further information on our segment disclosures. \nAs of January 2024, we adopted ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sales Restrictions, which (1) clarifies the guidance in Topic 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and (2) requires specific disclosures related to such an equity security. The standard became effective for our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for interim periods beginning in 2025. The impact of the adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of January 1, 2022, we adopted ASU 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842), which requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable lease payments (that do not depend on an index or rate) as an operating lease if (1) the lease would have been classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease, and (2) the lessor would have recognized a selling loss at lease commencement. These changes are intended to avoid recognizing a day-one loss for a lease with variable payments even though the lessor expects the arrangement will be profitable overall. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 2\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nA component of an entity is reported in discontinued operations after meeting the criteria for held-for-sale classification if the disposition represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results. The consolidated financial statements reflect discontinued operations for two strategic actions, as described below. \nDiscontinued Operations - Kidney Care\nOn August 12, 2024, we entered into an EPA to sell our Kidney Care business, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions. That business, which is comprised of our former Kidney Care segment, provides chronic and acute dialysis therapies and services, including peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapies, and other organ support therapies. On January 31, 2025, we completed the sale of our Kidney Care business to Carlyle for an aggregate purchase price of $\n3.80\n billion in cash, subject to certain closing cash, working capital and debt adjustments. After giving effect to certain adjustments, we received approximately $\n3.71\n billion pre-tax cash proceeds at closing of the transaction with the net after tax proceeds currently estimated to be approximately $\n3.4\n billion, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\nWe concluded that our Kidney Care business met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale in August 2024. We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the sale of our Kidney Care business, including its significance to our overall net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, and net assets, and determined that those conditions for discontinued operations presentation had been met. As such, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of that business are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect discontinued operations presentation. The fair value and carrying value of assets held for sale are evaluated each period and a loss on sale is recognized when the fair value less costs to sell are below the carrying value. There has been no loss on sale recognized for the period ending December 31, 2024. We will recognize a gain or loss upon disposition of the business depending on the carrying value at that date, including any tax impacts of the sale, which may be material.\nUpon closing of the sale of the Kidney Care business, Baxter and Vantive entered into several agreements, including a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (Kidney Care MSA), a long-term Master Services Agreement, a Distribution Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement (Kidney Care TSA), and an Intellectual Property Agreement. Pursuant to the Kidney Care MSA, Baxter and the Kidney Care divested entities will provide each other \n75\nwith certain dialysis-related products, other products, product components and fulfillment services for a period up to \n10\n years post-closing (with certain extension rights as provided therein). Pursuant to the Kidney Care TSA, Baxter and the entities that will be divested in connection with the Kidney Care sale (the Kidney Care divested entities) will provide each other, on an interim basis, certain transitional services for up to \n30\n months post-closing (with certain extension rights as provided therein) to help ensure business continuity and help minimize disruptions to the entities' operations post-closing. Services to be provided under the Kidney Care TSA include information technology applications and support, supply chain and certain other corporate and administrative services. Pursuant to the EPA, Baxter will retain (i) the manufacture and sale of saline solutions and (ii) the plastics operations of Baxter and its subsidiaries at its Mountain Home, Arkansas facility, which is not part of the Kidney Care segment.\nDiscontinued Operations - BioPharma Solutions\nOn September 29, 2023, we sold our BPS business to Advent International and Warburg Pincus (collectively, the buyers). Under the terms of the related Equity Purchase agreement entered into with the buyers in May 2023, we were entitled to aggregate consideration of $\n4.25\n billion, subject to adjustment for specified items. After giving effect to those adjustments, we received cash proceeds of $\n3.96\n billion. We recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $\n2.88\n billion ($\n2.59\n billion net of tax), which represents the excess of (a) the $\n3.91\n billion in net consideration received, consisting of (i) $\n3.96\n billion in cash proceeds from the buyers, less (ii) $\n47\n million in transaction costs, over (b) the sum of (i) the $\n840\n million net book value of the BPS business upon the closing of the transaction and (ii) BPS's $\n181\n million other comprehensive loss, which was reclassified to earnings.\nThe BPS business, which was historically reported within our former Americas segment, provided contract manufacturing and development services, which include sterile fill-finish manufacturing and support services across clinical and commercial applications, primarily serving customers in the pharmaceutical industry. BPS was historically operated through our former, wholly-owned subsidiaries Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Baxter Oncology GmbH, a German limited liability company (collectively, the divested entities). \nWe concluded that our BPS business met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale in May 2023. A component of an entity is reported in discontinued operations after meeting the criteria for held-for-sale classification if the disposition represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results. We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the divestiture of our BPS business, including its significance to our overall net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share, and determined that those conditions for discontinued operations presentation had been met. As such, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of that business, including our gain from the sale of that business and the related cash proceeds received, are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect discontinued operations presentation.\nAt closing of the transaction, Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions LLC included a BPS manufacturing facility in Bloomington Indiana and Baxter Oncology GmbH included a manufacturing facility in Halle Germany. Previously, Baxter Oncology GmbH included an additional manufacturing site in Bielefeld Germany that was not part of the BPS business and was transferred to another Baxter entity prior to closing of the divestiture. Accordingly, amounts related to the Bielefeld site continue to be presented as continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAt closing of the transaction, Baxter entered into a Transition Services Agreement (BPS TSA) and a Master Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (BPS MSA) with the divested entities.

The purchase price of each acquisition is allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimates of their fair values (or other measurement attribute required under U.S. GAAP) at the date of the acquisition. Any purchase price in excess of these net assets is recorded as goodwill. \nContingent consideration related to business combinations is recognized at its estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of those contingent consideration arrangements are recognized in earnings. Contingent consideration related to business acquisitions may consist of development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, and sales or earnings-based payments, and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. The fair value of development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments reflects management’s expectations of the probability of payment, and increases or decreases as the probability of payment or expectation of timing or amount of payments changes. The fair value of sales-based payments is based upon probability-weighted future revenue estimates and increases or decreases as revenue estimates or expectation of timing or amount of payments changes.\nHillrom\nIn 2021, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding equity interests of Hillrom for a purchase price of $\n10.48\n billion. Hillrom was a global medical technology leader whose products and services help enable earlier diagnosis and treatment, optimize surgical efficiency, and accelerate patient recovery while simplifying clinical communication and shifting care closer to home. Hillrom made those outcomes possible through digital and connected care solutions and collaboration tools, including smart bed systems, patient monitoring and diagnostic \n78\ntechnologies, respiratory health devices, advanced equipment for the surgical space and more, delivering actionable, real-time insights at the point of care.  \nImpairment of Goodwill from Our Hillrom Acquisition\nDuring 2024, we recorded a $\n425\n million goodwill impairment related to our Front Line Care reporting unit within our Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding this goodwill impairment.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we performed trigger-based impairment tests of the goodwill of each of the reporting units within our Hillrom segment (currently referred to as our Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment), as well as the indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of trade names, that we\nacquired in connection with the Hillrom acquisition. We performed those tests as of September 30, 2022 due to (a) macroeconomic conditions, including the rising interest rate environment and broad declines in equity valuations, and (b) reduced earnings forecasts for our Hillrom reporting units, driven primarily by shortages of certain component parts used in our products, raw materials inflation and increased supply chain costs. Those impairment tests resulted in total pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $\n2.79\n billion in the third quarter of 2022. In\nconnection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed quantitative impairment tests for all of our reporting units and recorded an additional $\n27\n million goodwill impairment related to our Hillrom segment. No goodwill impairments were recorded for our remaining reporting units in connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests because the fair values of those reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts\nThe fair values of the reporting units tested for impairment during 2022 were determined based on a discounted cash flow model (an income approach) and earnings multiples (a market approach) based on the guideline public company method. Significant assumptions used in the determination of the fair values of our reporting units generally include forecasted cash flows, discount rates, terminal growth rates and earnings multiples. The discounted cash flow models used to determine the fair values of our reporting units during 2022 reflected our most recent cash flow projections, discount rates ranging from \n9\n% to \n10\n% and terminal growth rates ranging from \n2\n% to \n3\n%. Our reporting unit fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they involve significant unobservable inputs.\nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets from Our Hillrom Acquisition\nIn addition to the goodwill impairments discussed above, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $\n332\n million in the third quarter of 2022 to reduce the carrying amounts of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily related to the Hillrom and Welch Allyn trade names acquired in the Hillrom acquisition, to their estimated fair values. Those intangible asset impairment charges are classified within cost of sales in the accompanying \nconsolidated statements of income (loss)\n for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe fair values of the trade name intangible assets were determined using the relief from royalty method. Significant assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the trade name intangible assets included revenue growth rates, terminal growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. The relief from royalty models used in the determination of the fair values of our trade name intangible assets during 2022 reflected our most recent revenue projections, a discount rate of \n9.5\n%, royalty rates ranging from \n3\n% to \n5\n% and terminal growth rates ranging from \n2\n% to \n3\n%. Our trade name intangible asset fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they involve significant unobservable inputs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized an impairment charge of $\n12\n million related to developed-technology intangible assets due to declines in market expectations for the related products. The fair values of the intangible assets were measured using a discounted cash flow approach and the charge is classified within cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022. We consider the fair values of the assets to be Level 3 measurements due to the significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasted future cash flows, that we used in establishing the estimated fair values.\nOther\nTotal consideration transferred for other acquisitions totaled $\n32\n million in 2022 and primarily resulted in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets. These acquisitions did not materially affect our results of operations.\n79\nOther Business Development Activities\nZosyn\nIn March 2022, we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. to acquire the rights to Zosyn, a premixed frozen piperacillin-tazobactam product, in the U.S. and Canada. Zosyn is used for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections, nosocomial pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, female pelvic infections and community-acquired pneumonia. Under the terms of the acquisition, we paid the acquisition price of $\n122\n million and received specified intellectual property, including patent rights, in the first quarter of 2022 and received additional intellectual property, including the product rights to Zosyn, in the first quarter of 2023. Under the arrangement, we received profit sharing payments from sales of Zosyn until the product rights transferred to us in April 2023. The related profit sharing payments that were earned during 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nThe transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the fair value of the assets  acquired under the arrangement was concentrated in the product rights that we received, which we classify as a developed technology intangible asset. Accordingly, the $\n122\n million purchase price was primarily allocated to the developed technology intangible asset class and is being amortized over an estimated useful life of \n9\n years.\nCelerity Pharmaceuticals, LLC\n \nIn September 2013, we entered into an agreement with Celerity Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Celerity) to develop certain acute care generic injectable premix and oncolytic products through regulatory approval. We transferred our rights in these products to Celerity and Celerity assumed ownership and responsibility for development of the products. We were obligated to purchase the individual product rights from Celerity if the products obtained regulatory approval. In December 2020, we entered into an agreement with a third party to divest our rights to one of the products that was being developed by Celerity, a generic version of liposomal doxorubicin, for less than $\n1\n million if that product were to receive regulatory approval in the U.S. and European Union in 2022. Liposomal doxorubicin is a chemotherapy medicine used to treat various types of cancer and we entered into this transaction to divest our rights to this generic version of that product after we had separately entered into a transaction to acquire the branded version.\nThe related regulatory approvals were subsequently obtained for the generic version of liposomal doxorubicin and we recognized a loss of approximately $\n54\n million in the third quarter of 2022, representing the difference between the amount we owed Celerity following those regulatory approvals and the proceeds that we were entitled to receive from our divestiture of those product rights. That loss is reported within other operating expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOther Asset Acquisitions\nDuring 2021, we also entered into distribution license arrangements for multiple products that have not yet obtained regulatory approval. In addition to the cash paid at acquisition, we could make additional payments of up to $\n17\n million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones.\nOther\nIn addition to the arrangements described above, we have entered into several other collaborative arrangements. We could make additional payments of up to $\n20\n million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, in addition to future payments related to contingent commercialization milestones, profit-sharing and royalties.\n80\nNOTE 4\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe following table is a summary of changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nyears ended December 31\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at beginning of period\n$\n62\n \n$\n50\n \n$\n52\n \nCharged to costs and expenses\n7\n \n7\n \n3\n \nWrite-offs\n(\n8\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n3\n)\nCurrency translation adjustments\n10\n \n9\n \n(\n2\n)\nBalance at end of period\n$\n71\n \n$\n62\n \n$\n50\n \nInventories\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nRaw materials\n$\n510\n \n$\n530\n \nWork in process\n266\n \n234\n \nFinished goods\n1,270\n \n1,154\n \nInventories\n$\n2,046\n \n$\n1,918\n \nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nPrepaid value added taxes\n$\n167\n \n$\n118\n \nPrepaid income taxes\n199\n \n204\n \nSpare parts\n123\n \n141\n \nContract assets\n51\n \n53\n \nDerivative assets\n8\n \n45\n \nOther\n205\n \n145\n \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n$\n753\n \n$\n706\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nLand and land improvements\n$\n115\n \n$\n119\n \nBuildings and leasehold improvements\n1,301\n \n1,238\n \nMachinery and equipment\n5,047\n \n4,909\n \nEquipment on lease with customers\n467\n \n760\n \nConstruction in progress\n718\n \n624\n \nTotal property, plant and equipment, at cost\n7,648\n \n7,650\n \nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n4,778\n)\n(\n4,779\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n$\n2,870\n \n$\n2,871\n \nDepreciation expense was $\n372\n million in 2024, $\n394\n million in 2023 and $\n393\n million in 2022.\n81\nOther Non-Current Assets\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nDeferred tax assets\n$\n204\n \n$\n263\n \nNon-current receivables, net\n50\n \n42\n \nContract assets\n82\n \n112\n \nCapitalized implementation costs in hosting arrangements\n102\n \n103\n \nPension and other postretirement benefits\n56\n \n46\n \nInvestments\n109\n \n136\n \nOther\n152\n \n107\n \nOther non-current assets\n$\n755\n \n$\n809\n \nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCommon stock dividends payable\n$\n87\n \n$\n147\n \nEmployee compensation and withholdings\n447\n \n477\n \nProperty, payroll and certain other taxes\n96\n \n92\n \nContract liabilities\n131\n \n128\n \nRestructuring liabilities\n112\n \n81\n \nAccrued rebates\n214\n \n240\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n80\n \n92\n \nIncome taxes payable\n121\n \n78\n \nPension and other postretirement benefits\n39\n \n37\n \nContingent payments related to acquisitions\n—\n \n3\n \nOther\n534\n \n540\n \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n$\n1,861\n \n$\n1,915\n \nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nPension and other postretirement benefits\n$\n678\n \n$\n714\n \nDeferred tax liabilities\n103\n \n403\n \nLong-term tax liabilities\n94\n \n72\n \nContingent payments related to acquisitions\n11\n \n11\n \nContract liabilities\n40\n \n41\n \nLitigation and environmental reserves\n29\n \n19\n \nRestructuring liabilities\n10\n \n14\n \nOther\n111\n \n126\n \nOther non-current liabilities\n$\n1,076\n \n$\n1,400\n \nInterest Expense, net\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest costs\n$\n421\n \n$\n523\n \n$\n423\n \nInterest costs capitalized\n(\n13\n)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n10\n)\nInterest expense\n408\n \n508\n \n413\n \nInterest income\n(\n67\n)\n(\n69\n)\n(\n19\n)\nInterest expense, net\n$\n341\n \n$\n439\n \n$\n394\n \n82\nOther (Income) Expense, net\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nForeign exchange (gains) losses, net\n$\n25\n \n$\n53\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\nChange in fair value of marketable equity securities\n(\n3\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n11\n)\nPension settlement and curtailment (gains) losses\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n12\n)\nPension and other postretirement benefit (gains) losses\n(\n39\n)\n(\n48\n)\n(\n30\n)\nReclassification of cumulative translation loss to earnings\n—\n \n—\n \n65\n \nNon-marketable investment impairments    \n—\n \n34\n \n—\n \nOther, net\n(\n21\n)\n(\n6\n)\n—\n \nOther (income) expense, net\n$\n(\n38\n)\n$\n26\n \n$\n9\n \nFollowing the wind down of our operations in Argentina, we determined that the net assets of the related entities were substantially liquidated during the third quarter of 2022.

In the third quarter of 2023, we completed the implementation of a new operating model intended to simplify and streamline our operations and better align our \n83\nmanufacturing and supply chain to our commercial activities. Our segments were changed during the third quarter of 2023 to align with our new operating model. Under this operating model, our business is comprised of three reportable segments: Medical Products & Therapies, Healthcare Systems & Technologies (formerly referred to as our Hillrom segment) and Pharmaceuticals. As a result of this segment change, we reallocated the goodwill from our previous Americas, EMEA and APAC segments to the reporting units within our Medical Products & Therapies and Pharmaceuticals segments based on the relative fair values of those reporting units. We performed goodwill impairment assessments both before and after the reporting unit change and we did \nnot\n identify any goodwill impairments. \nGoodwill Impairment\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded a $\n425\n million goodwill impairment related to our Front Line Care reporting unit within our Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment. The reduction in value was primarily due to lower forecasted operating results and a lower terminal growth rate utilized in valuing this reporting unit which contributed to reduced expected future cash flows, as well as lower earnings multiples. The fair value of the Front Line Care reporting unit was determined based on a discounted cash flow model (an income approach) and earnings multiples (a market approach) based on the guideline public company method. Significant assumptions used in the determination of the fair values of our reporting units generally include revenue growth rates, forecasted EBITDA margins, discount rates, terminal growth rates and earnings multiples. The discounted cash flow model used to determine the fair value of our Front Line Care reporting unit reflected our most recent cash flow projections, a discount rate of \n9.5\n% and a terminal growth rate of \n3.25\n%. Our reporting unit fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they involve significant unobservable inputs. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of goodwill for our Front Line Care reporting unit was $\n1.99\n billion. No goodwill impairments were recorded for our remaining reporting units in connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests because the fair values of those reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts. \nOther Intangible Assets, Net\nThe following is a summary of our other intangible assets.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\n(in millions)\nCustomer relationships\nDeveloped technology,\nincluding patents\nTrade Names\nOther amortized\nintangible assets\nTrade Names\nIn process Research and Development\nTotal\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross other intangible assets\n$\n3,390\n \n$\n3,181\n \n$\n964\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n680\n \n$\n157\n \n$\n8,458\n \nAccumulated amortization\n(\n654\n)\n(\n1,782\n)\n(\n38\n)\n(\n66\n)\n— \n— \n$\n(\n2,540\n)\nOther intangible assets, net\n$\n2,736\n \n$\n1,399\n \n$\n926\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n680\n \n$\n157\n \n$\n5,918\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nGross other intangible assets\n$\n3,387\n \n$\n3,131\n \n$\n958\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n680\n \n$\n107\n \n$\n8,349\n \nAccumulated amortization\n(\n878\n)\n(\n2,075\n)\n(\n107\n)\n(\n66\n)\n— \n— \n(\n3,126\n)\nOther intangible assets, net\n$\n2,509\n \n$\n1,056\n \n$\n851\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n680\n \n$\n107\n \n$\n5,223\n \nIntangible asset amortization expense was $\n625\n million in 2024, $\n590\n million in 2023 and $\n679\n million in 2022. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2024 is $\n586\n million in 2025, $\n562\n million in 2026, $\n412\n million in 2027, $\n400\n million in 2028 and $\n378\n million in 2029.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, as a result of an update to our long-term branding strategy, we reclassified two trade name intangible assets with carrying amounts of $\n870\n million and $\n21\n million from indefinite-lived intangible assets to amortizing intangible assets. The estimated useful lives assigned to those assets were \n15\n years and \n5\n years, respectively. We performed impairment tests of those intangible assets at the time of the reclassification and determined that no impairment had occurred.\n84\nIntangible Asset Impairments\n \nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets from Our Claris Acquisition\nIn connection with our annual IPR&D impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n50\n million to reduce the carrying amount of an IPR&D asset to its fair value. The reduction in value was primarily due to lower forecasted revenues and margins which contributed to reduced expected future cash flows. The intangible asset impairment charge is classified within research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024. The fair value of the IPR&D asset was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Significant assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the IPR&D asset included forecasted cash flows and the discount rate. The multi-period excess earnings model used in our determination of the fair value of the IPR&D asset reflected our most recent cash flow projections and a discount rate of \n11\n%. Our IPR&D intangible asset fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because it involves significant unobservable inputs.\n \n85\nNOTE 6\nDEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES\nDebt Outstanding\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had the following debt outstanding: \nas of December 31 (in millions)\nEffective interest rate as of December 31,2024¹\n2024\n1\n2023\n1\nCommercial paper\n4.8\n \n%\n$\n300\n \n$\n—\n \n0.4\n% notes due 2024\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n828\n \n1.322\n% notes due 2024\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n1,398\n \n7.0\n% notes due 2024\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n13\n \nFloating-rate notes due 2024\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n300\n \nTerm loan maturing 2024\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n130\n \n1.3\n% notes due 2025\n1.5\n \n%\n625\n \n662\n \nDelayed draw term loan due 2025\n5.7\n \n%\n1,826\n \n—\n \n2.6\n% notes due 2026\n2.7\n \n%\n749\n \n748\n \nTerm loan maturing 2026\n6.7\n \n%\n1,643\n \n1,643\n \n7.65\n% debentures due 2027\n7.7\n \n%\n5\n \n5\n \n1.915\n% notes due 2027\n2.0\n \n%\n1,446\n \n1,445\n \n6.625\n% debentures due 2028\n5.8\n \n%\n94\n \n95\n \n2.272\n% notes due 2028\n2.4\n \n%\n1,245\n \n1,244\n \n1.3\n% notes due 2029\n1.5\n \n%\n776\n \n828\n \n3.95\n% notes due 2030\n4.1\n \n%\n497\n \n496\n \n1.73\n% notes due 2031\n2.7\n \n%\n646\n \n646\n \n2.539\n% notes due 2032\n2.6\n \n%\n1,541\n \n1,540\n \n6.25\n% notes due 2037\n6.3\n \n%\n266\n \n265\n \n3.65\n% notes due 2042\n5.4\n \n%\n6\n \n6\n \n4.5\n% notes due 2043\n4.6\n \n%\n256\n \n256\n \n3.5\n% notes due 2046\n3.7\n \n%\n441\n \n440\n \n3.132\n% notes due 2051\n3.2\n \n%\n743\n \n741\n \nFinance leases and other\n4.2\n \n%\n21\n \n27\n \nTotal debt and finance lease obligations\n13,126\n \n13,756\n \nShort-term debt \n(\n2,126\n)\n—\n \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt and finance lease obligations\n(\n626\n)\n(\n2,667\n)\nLong-term debt and finance lease obligations\n$\n10,374\n \n$\n11,089\n \n1\nBook values include any discounts, premiums and adjustments related to hedging instruments and effective interest rates reflect amortization of those items.\nSignificant Debt Activity\nIn February 2025, we repaid $\n1.00\n billion under our $\n1.64\n billion \nfive-year\n term loan facility maturing in 2026.\nIn 2024, we repaid our $\n13\n million \n7.0\n% notes due 2024, $\n809\n million \n0.4\n% notes due 2024, $\n1.40\n billion \n1.322\n% notes due 2024, $\n300\n million floating rate notes due 2024 and $\n130\n million \nthree-year\n term loan facility due 2024.\nIn 2023, we repaid our $\n800\n million \n0.868\n% notes due 2023, our $\n300\n million floating rate notes due 2023 and $\n1.54\n billion under our $\n2.00\n billion \nthree-year\n term loan facility maturing in 2024. \nThe loss from our early extinguishments of debt in 2023 was not significant.\n \n86\nCredit Facilities \nOn July 17, 2024, we entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which a group of banks provided us with senior unsecured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n2.05\n billion (\"the bridge facility\"). Borrowings under the bridge facility were available in up to three drawings to fund (a) the refinancing of our \n1.322\n% Senior Notes due November 29, 2024, our Floating Rate Notes due November 29, 2024, and certain borrowings under our existing term loan facility and (b) payment of certain U.S. tax liabilities arising from internal reorganization transactions related to the sale of our Kidney Care business. Borrowings under the bridge facility bore interest at a rate based on our long-term debt ratings in effect from time to time and the interest rate on any borrowings outstanding beyond December 31, 2024 would increase by \n0.25\n%.\n \nWe also incurred a ticking fee on undrawn commitments at a rate based on our long-term debt ratings in effect from time to time. The banks' funding commitments under the bridge facility terminated on December 31, 2024. Outstanding borrowings under the bridge facility were scheduled to mature on the earlier of 364 days from the first funding date and November 24, 2025. Additionally, we were required to use the net cash proceeds from certain transactions (including from the sale of our Kidney Care business) to repay any outstanding borrowings under the bridge facility. The bridge facility contained financial and other covenants, including a net leverage covenant, and provided for customary events of default. In November 2024, we reduced the bridge facility capacity from $\n2.05\n billion to $\n1.83\n billion. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2024 we drew on the bridge facility to repay our \n1.322\n% Senior Notes due November 29, 2024, our Floating Rate Notes due November 29, 2024 and the outstanding balance on our \nthree-year\n term loan facility. There was $\n1.83\n billion outstanding \nunder this bridge facility as of \nDecember 31, 2024. In January 2025, we used a portion of the approximately $\n3.4\n billion of net after-tax cash proceeds from the sale of our Kidney Care business to repay the $\n1.83\n billion outstanding under the bridge facility, at which time it was terminated.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we amended the credit agreements governing our U.S. dollar-denominated term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility and the guaranty agreement with respect to our Euro-denominated revolving credit facility to increase the maximum net leverage ratio covenant for the six fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, December 31, 2024, March 31, 2025, June 30, 2025, and September 30, 2025. In accordance with the terms of the amendment, the capacity under our U.S dollar-denominated revolving credit facility was reduced from $\n2.50\n billion to $\n2.00\n billion on September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements. Costs incurred in connection with the amendment were not material. In the first quarter of 2023, we previously amended the credit agreements governing our U.S. Dollar-denominated term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility and the guaranty agreement with respect to our Euro-denominated revolving credit facility, in each case to amend the net leverage ratio covenant to increase the maximum net leverage ratio for the four fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a U.S. Dollar-denominated term loan credit facility, which had one tranche of term loans outstanding, a U.S. Dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and a Euro-denominated revolving credit facility. \nBorrowings under the term loan credit facility bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either Term SOFR plus an applicable margin plus a credit spread adjustment or a “base rate” plus an applicable margin. The term loan credit facility contains various covenants, including a maximum net leverage ratio. We have the option to prepay outstanding amounts under the term loan credit facility in whole or in part at any time.\nIn addition to our U.S. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility with a current capacity of $\n2.00\n billion, our Euro-denominated revolving credit facility has a capacity of €\n200\n million. Fees under the credit facilities are \n0.125\n% annually as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and are based on our credit ratings and the total capacity of the facility. There were \nno\n borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. Our commercial paper borrowing arrangements require us to maintain undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities for an amount at least equal to our outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Each of the revolving credit facilities is scheduled to mature in 2026. The revolving credit facilities enable us to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contain various covenants, including a maximum net leverage ratio. Based on our covenant calculations as of December 31, 2024 we have capacity to draw on the full amounts under our revolving credit facilities, less commercial paper borrowings which were $\n300\n million at year-end.\nWe also maintain other credit arrangements, which totaled approximately $\n412\n million and $\n238\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase over the prior year is due to additional credit arrangements entered into in preparation for the sale of our Kidney Care business. There were \nno\n amounts outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  \n87\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements. The non-performance of any financial institution supporting any of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of these facilities by each institution’s respective commitment.\nCommercial Paper \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $\n300\n million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted-average interest rate of \n4.78\n% and an original term of \n45\n days. There was \nno\n commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023. In 2025, we repaid the $\n300\n million balance outstanding as of December 31, 2024. \nFuture Debt and Finance Lease Maturities\nas of and for the years ended December 31 (in millions)\nDebt maturities\n2025\n$\n2,757\n \n2026\n2,398\n \n2027\n1,458\n \n2028\n1,345\n \n2029\n784\n \nThereafter\n4,438\n \nTotal debt and finance lease maturities\n13,180\n \nDiscounts, premiums, and adjustments relating to hedging instruments\n(\n54\n)\nTotal debt and finance lease obligations\n$\n13,126\n \nNOTE 7\nLEASES\nLessee Activity\nWe have entered into operating and finance leases primarily for office, manufacturing, warehouse and R&D facilities, vehicles and equipment. Our leases have remaining terms from \n1\n to \n38\n years and some of those leases include options that provide us with the ability to extend the lease term for periods ranging from \n1\n to \n10\n years. Such options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nCertain of our leases include provisions for variable lease payments which are based on, but not limited to, maintenance, insurance, taxes, index escalations and usage-based amounts. For all asset classes, we have elected to apply a practical expedient to account for other services within lease contracts as components of the lease. We also have elected to apply a practical expedient for short-term leases whereby we do not recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset for leases with a term of less than 12 months.\nWe classify our leases as operating or finance at the lease commencement date. Finance leases are generally those leases for which we will pay substantially all of the underlying asset’s fair value or will use the asset for all or a major part of its economic life, including circumstances in which we will ultimately own the asset. All other leases are operating leases. For finance leases, we recognize interest expense using the effective interest method and we recognize amortization expense on the right-of-use asset over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. For operating leases, we recognize lease cost on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nLease liabilities and right-of-use assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the lease term. We determine the present value of payments under a lease based on our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate is equal to the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. \n88\nThe components of lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating lease cost\n$\n89\n \n$\n94\n \n$\n93\n \nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of right-of-use assets\n4\n \n3\n \n3\n \nInterest on lease liabilities\n1\n \n1\n \n1\n \nVariable lease cost\n54\n \n45\n \n44\n \nLease cost\n$\n148\n \n$\n143\n \n$\n141\n \nThe following table contains supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n$\n100\n \n$\n115\n \n$\n108\n \nOperating cash flows from finance leases\n5\n \n3\n \n2\n \nFinancing cash flows from finance leases\n2\n \n1\n \n1\n \nRight-of-use operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations\n64\n \n66\n \n59\n \nRight-of-use finance lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations\n1\n \n15\n \n—\n \nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 include:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nOperating leases\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n$\n306\n \n$\n336\n \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n$\n80\n \n$\n92\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n243\n \n265\n \nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n323\n \n$\n357\n \nFinance leases\nProperty, plant and equipment, at cost\n$\n33\n \n$\n33\n \nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n15\n)\n(\n13\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment,  net\n$\n18\n \n$\n20\n \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt and finance lease obligations\n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \nLong-term debt and finance lease obligations\n19\n \n25\n \nTotal finance lease liabilities\n$\n21\n \n$\n27\n \n89\nLease term and discount rates as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases\n6\n6\nFinance leases\n8\n8\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases\n3.1\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\nFinance leases\n4.2\n \n%\n3.9\n \n%\nMaturities of operating and finance lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024 were:\n(in millions)\nFinance Leases\nOperating Leases\n2025\n$\n4\n \n$\n93\n \n2026\n4\n \n75\n \n2027\n4\n \n63\n \n2028\n3\n \n44\n \n2029\n3\n \n24\n \nThereafter\n10\n \n62\n \nTotal minimum lease payments\n28\n \n361\n \nLess: imputed interest\n(\n7\n)\n(\n38\n)\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$\n21\n \n$\n323\n \nLessor Activity\nWe lease medical equipment, such as smart beds and infusion pumps, to customers, often in conjunction with arrangements to provide consumable medical products such as intravenous (IV) fluids and inhaled anesthetics.

Indemnifications include: (i) intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sales or license of products and services; (ii) indemnities to customers in connection with losses incurred while performing services on their premises; (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct; (iv) indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts; and (v) contractual indemnities for our directors and our executive and corporate officers for services provided to or at the request of us. In addition, under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and consistent with Delaware General Corporation Law, we have agreed to indemnify our directors and officers for certain losses and expenses upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that we could be obligated to make. To help address some of these risks, we maintain various insurance coverages. Based on historical experience and evaluation of the agreements, we do not believe that any payments related to our indemnities will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n \nLegal Contingencies\nWe are involved in product liability, patent, commercial, employment, and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of our business. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our total recorded reserves with respect to legal and environmental matters were $\n40\n million and $\n25\n million, respectively. \n91\nWe have established reserves for certain of the matters discussed below. We are not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved. While our liability in connection with these claims cannot be estimated and the resolution thereof in any reporting period could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. While we believe that we have valid defenses in the matters set forth below, litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur, and we may incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims.  \nIn addition to the matters described below, we remain subject to the risk of future administrative and legal actions. With respect to governmental and regulatory matters, these actions may lead to product recalls, injunctions, and other restrictions on our operations (including our ability to launch new products) and monetary sanctions, including significant civil or criminal penalties. With respect to intellectual property, we may be exposed to significant litigation concerning the scope of our and others’ rights. Such litigation could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations.\nEnvironmental\nWe are involved as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for environmental clean-up costs at \nsix\n Superfund sites. Additionally, we are a defendant in a separate matter regarding a seventh Superfund site. Under the U.S. Superfund statute and many state laws, generators of hazardous waste sent to a disposal or recycling site are liable for site cleanup if contaminants from that property later leak into the environment. The laws generally provide that a PRP may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigating and remediating the site. Separate from these Superfund cases noted above, we are involved in ongoing environmental remediations associated with historic operations at certain of our facilities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our environmental reserves, which are measured on an undiscounted basis, were $\n29\n million and $\n15\n million, respectively. After considering these reserves, the outcome of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nGeneral Litigation \nIn March 2020, \ntwo\n lawsuits were filed against us in the Northern District of Illinois by plaintiffs alleging injuries as a result of exposure to ethylene oxide used in our manufacturing facility in Mountain Home, Arkansas to sterilize certain of our products. The plaintiffs sought damages, including compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount, and unspecified injunctive and declaratory relief. The parties reached an agreement to settle these lawsuits in the third quarter of 2021 for amounts that were not material to our financial results, which were paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. We have since resolved, without litigation, additional claims of injuries from exposure to ethylene oxide at Mountain Home for amounts within accruals previously established as of December 31, 2021. On October 20, 2022, a lawsuit was filed against us in the Western District of Arkansas alleging injury as a result of exposure to ethylene oxide at Mountain Home. On December 16, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss and for a more definite statement. In response, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on January 6, 2023. We answered the First Amended Complaint on January 27, 2023. The parties reached an agreement to settle this lawsuit in the third quarter of 2023 for an amount that was not material to our financial results, which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2023. The case was dismissed on October 17, 2023. Since December 2023, \n41\n lawsuits (after giving effect to the amendment referenced below) have been filed against us in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by plaintiffs alleging injuries as a result of exposure to ethylene oxide used by several companies, including historic use by us for sterilization at our facility in Round Lake, Illinois. The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount. On July 16, 2024, Plaintiffs' counsel filed an omnibus motion seeking leave to add certain defendants to hundreds of previously-filed lawsuits, including Baxter with respect to \n40\n cases. The motion was denied on July 25, 2024, without prejudice to refiling multiple motions each addressing smaller groupings of cases and defendants. On September 11, 2024, the court granted leave to amend \none\n previously-filed complaint to add Baxter as a defendant. \nWe acquired Hillrom on December 13, 2021. In July 2021, Hill-Rom, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hillrom, received a subpoena from the United States Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS) requesting documents and information related to compliance with the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute. The subpoena was related to a lawsuit brought under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act. The allegations included in the unsealed complaint relate to conduct prior to our acquisition of Hillrom, and the division involved is no longer operational. Hillrom voluntarily began a related internal review, and Hillrom and Baxter cooperated fully with the DHHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) with respect to this matter. In \n92\nJanuary 2024, the parties reached an agreement to settle the allegations. We paid the settlement amounts, which were not material to our financial results, in January 2024 and the matter was dismissed in February 2024. In October 2022, the DOJ issued a separate Civil Investigative Demand (CID) addressed to Hillrom, requesting documents and information related to compliance with the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute. In October 2024, the DOJ issued a subpoena (the 2024 Subpoena), pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3846, to Hillrom. The 2024 Subpoena substantially overlaps with the CID and requests additional documents relating to Hillrom's respiratory health business. Baxter is cooperating fully with the DOJ in responding to the CID and the 2024 Subpoena. The DHHS and DOJ often issue these types of requests when investigating alleged violations of the federal health care laws.\nOn December 28, 2021, Linet Americas, Inc. (Linet) filed a complaint against Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., Hill-Rom Company, Inc., and Hill-Rom Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, captioned Linet Americas, Inc. v. Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.; Hill-Rom Company, Inc.; Hill-Rom Services, Inc. Linet alleges that Hillrom violated Sections 1 and 2 of The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, Section 3 of the Clayton Act, and the Illinois Antitrust Act by allegedly engaging in anti-competitive conduct in alleged markets for standard, ICU and birthing beds.  Hillrom filed an answer to the complaint on January 28, 2022 and filed a motion challenging certain aspects of plaintiff's case on May 27, 2022, which was denied on January 17, 2024, subject to further discovery.\nOn June 20, 2024, Reading Hospital filed a putative class action complaint against Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., Hill-Rom Company, Inc., and Hill-Rom Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges that Hillrom violated Sections 1 and 2 of The Sherman Antitrust Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act by allegedly engaging in anti-competitive conduct in alleged markets for standard, ICU and birthing beds. The plaintiff filed the action on behalf of itself and all \"direct purchasers of Standard Hospital Beds, ICU Beds, and/or Birthing Beds from Hill-Rom during a period beginning at least as early as June 20, 2020” and continuing past the date of filing. On September 30, 2024, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint. On November 8, 2024, Hillrom filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. Briefing was completed in January 2025 and the motion is pending before the court.\nNOTE 9\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation generally includes stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance share units (PSUs) and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. Shares issued relating to our stock-based plans are generally issued out of treasury stock.\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately \n48\n million authorized shares are available for future awards under our stock-based compensation plans.\nStock Compensation Expense\nStock compensation expense was $\n114\n million, $\n115\n million and $\n140\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The related tax benefit recognized was $\n8\n million in 2024, $\n10\n million in 2023 and $\n31\n million in 2022. Included in the benefit in 2024 and 2023 was tax expense for stock-based compensation shortfalls of $\n9\n million and $\n11\n million, respectively. Included in the benefit in 2022 were realized excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation $\n5\n million.\nApproximately \n70\n% of stock compensation expense is classified in SG&A expenses, with the remainder classified in cost of sales and R&D expenses. Costs capitalized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not material.\nStock compensation expense is based on awards expected to vest and therefore has been reduced by estimated forfeitures.\n93\nStock Options\nStock options are granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to \n100\n% of the market value on the date of grant. Stock options granted to employees generally vest in one-third increments over a \nthree-year\n period. Stock options granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately on the grant date and are issued with a \nsix-month\n claw-back provision. Stock options typically have a contractual term of \n10 years\n. The grant-date fair value, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period.\nThe fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model. \nThe weighted-average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted during each year, along with the weighted-average grant-date fair values, were as follows:\nyears ended December 31\n2023\n2022\nExpected volatility\n27\n \n%\n24\n \n%\nExpected life (in years)\n6.0\n5.5\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.2\n \n%\n1.8\n \n%\nDividend yield\n3.0\n \n%\n1.3\n \n%\nFair value per stock option\n$\n9\n \n$\n18\n \nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2024.\n(options and aggregate intrinsic values in thousands)\nOptions\nWeighted-\naverage\nexercise\nprice\nWeighted-\naverage\nremaining\ncontractual\nterm\n(in years)\nAggregate\nintrinsic\nvalue\nOutstanding as of January 1, 2024\n19,467\n \n$\n59.35\n \nGranted\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nExercised\n(\n760\n)\n$\n37.43\n \nForfeited\n(\n287\n)\n$\n47.96\n \nExpired\n(\n1,039\n)\n$\n65.21\n \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2024\n17,381\n \n$\n60.15\n \n3.83\n$\n—\n \nVested or expected to vest as of December 31, 2024\n17,236\n \n$\n60.31\n \n3.80\n$\n—\n \nExercisable as of December 31, 2024\n14,718\n \n$\n62.66\n \n3.32\n$\n—\n \nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between the exercise price and our closing stock price on the last trading day of the year. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n1\n million, $\n5\n million and $\n37\n million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n11\n million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of approximately \n1.1\n years.\nRSUs\nRSUs are granted to employees and non-employee directors. RSUs granted to employees generally vest in one-third increments over a \nthree-year\n period. RSUs granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately on the grant date and are issued with a \nsix-month\n claw-back provision. The grant-date fair value, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.\n94\nThe following table summarizes nonvested RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2024. \n(share units in thousands)\nShare units\nWeighted-\naverage\ngrant-date\nfair value\nNonvested RSUs as of January 1, 2024\n4,006\n \n$\n49.77\n \nGranted\n5,179\n \n$\n42.28\n \nVested\n(\n1,565\n)\n$\n53.64\n \nForfeited\n(\n680\n)\n$\n46.32\n \nNonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2024\n6,940\n \n$\n43.94\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n123\n million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of approximately \n1.8\n years. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n42.37\n, $\n39.20\n and $\n81.66\n, respectively. The fair value of RSUs vested in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n46\n million, $\n25\n million and $\n69\n million, respectively.\nPSUs\nOur annual equity awards stock compensation program for senior management includes the issuance of PSUs. PSUs awarded in 2024 (which grants were made solely to the CEO and Chief Financial Officer) were based on our stock performance relative to our peer group over the \n3-year\n performance period. PSUs awarded in 2020 through 2023 were based on our compound annual sales growth rate (CAGR) performance, our adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) performance and on our stock performance relative to our peer group. The vesting condition for these CAGR and ROIC PSUs was set at the beginning of the \n3-year\n performance period. Compensation cost for the CAGR and adjusted ROIC PSUs is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the date that the specific vesting terms for each award are established and the fair value of the awards is determined based on the quoted price of our stock on the grant date of the award. The compensation cost for CAGR and adjusted ROIC PSUs is adjusted at each reporting date to reflect the estimated vesting outcome.\nThe fair value for PSUs based on our stock performance relative to our peer group is determined using a Monte Carlo model. \nThe assumptions used in estimating the fair value of these PSUs granted during the period, along with the grant-date fair values, were as follows:\nyears ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBaxter volatility\n29\n \n%\n27\n \n%\n27\n \n%\nPeer group volatility\n20\n%-\n52\n%\n23\n%-\n54\n%\n24\n%-\n54\n%\nCorrelation of returns\n0.12\n-\n0.51\n0.23\n-\n0.48\n0.21\n-\n0.61\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.3\n \n%\n4.6\n \n%\n1.6\n \n%\nFair value per PSU\n$\n57\n \n$\n30\n \n$\n102\n \n95\nThe following table summarizes nonvested PSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n(share units in thousands)\nShare units\nWeighted-\naverage\ngrant-date\nfair value\nNonvested PSUs as of January 1, 2024\n729\n \n$\n57.03\n \nGranted\n186\n \n$\n57.22\n \nVested\n(\n73\n)\n$\n77.35\n \nForfeited\n(\n240\n)\n$\n87.85\n \nNonvested PSUs as of December 31, 2024\n602\n \n$\n42.36\n \nUnrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested PSUs of $\n6\n million at December 31, 2024 is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of \n2.7\n years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nNearly all employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan. The employee purchase price is \n85\n% of the closing market price on the purchase date.\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately \n8\n million shares of common stock were available for issuance to eligible participants.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 we issued approximately \n1.4\n million shares and during the year ended  December 31, 2022, we issued approximately \n0.9\n million shares under the employee stock purchase plan. \nCash Dividends\nTotal cash dividends declared per share for 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $\n1.04\n, $\n1.16\n and $\n1.15\n, respectively.\nA quarterly dividend of $\n0.29\n per share ($\n1.16\n on an annualized basis) was declared in February, May and July of 2024 and was paid in April, July and October of 2024, respectively. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $\n0.17\n per share in November of 2024, which was paid in January of 2025.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nAs authorized by the Board of Directors, we repurchase our stock depending on our cash flows, net debt level and market conditions. In July 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program and the related authorization was subsequently increased a number of times. We did not repurchase any shares under this authority in 2024 or 2023. We repurchased \n0.5\n million shares under this authority pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans for $\n32\n million in cash in 2022. We had $\n1.30\n billion of repurchase authority available as of December 31, 2024.  \nOther\nIn addition to common stock, our authorized capital structure includes \n100\n million shares of preferred stock, \nno\n par value. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nno\n shares of preferred stock were outstanding.\nNOTE 10\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nComprehensive income (loss) includes all changes in stockholders’ equity that do not arise from transactions with stockholders, and consists of net income (loss), CTA, certain gains and losses from pension and other postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) plans, certain gains and losses from hedging activities and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities. \n96\nThe following table is a net-of-tax summary of the changes in AOCI by component for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n(in millions)\nCTA\nPension and OPEB plans\nHedging\nactivities\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nTotal\nGains (losses)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n(\n2,985\n)\n$\n(\n452\n)\n$\n(\n120\n)\n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n3,554\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n(\n445\n)\n(\n19\n)\n10\n \n—\n \n(\n454\n)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI (a)\n—\n \n(\n4\n)\n2\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\nNet other comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n445\n)\n(\n23\n)\n12\n \n—\n \n(\n456\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n(\n3,430\n)\n$\n(\n475\n)\n$\n(\n108\n)\n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n4,010\n)\n(in millions)\nCTA\nPension and OPEB plans\nHedging\nactivities\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nTotal\nGains (losses)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n(\n3,386\n)\n$\n(\n331\n)\n$\n(\n119\n)\n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n3,833\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n216\n \n(\n106\n)\n5\n \n—\n \n115\n \nAmounts reclassified from AOCI (a)\n185\n \n(\n15\n)\n(\n6\n)\n—\n \n164\n \nNet other comprehensive income (loss)\n401\n \n(\n121\n)\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n279\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n(\n2,985\n)\n$\n(\n452\n)\n$\n(\n120\n)\n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n3,554\n)\n(in millions)\nCTA\nPension and OPEB plans\nHedging\nactivities\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nTotal\nGains (losses)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021\n$\n(\n2,907\n)\n$\n(\n347\n)\n$\n(\n126\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n3,380\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n(\n544\n)\n(\n9\n)\n22\n \n3\n \n(\n528\n)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI (a)\n65\n \n25\n \n(\n15\n)\n—\n \n75\n \nNet other comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n479\n)\n16\n \n7\n \n3\n \n(\n453\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n(\n3,386\n)\n$\n(\n331\n)\n$\n(\n119\n)\n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n3,833\n)\n(a)    See table below for details about these reclassifications.\n97\nThe following table is a summary of the amounts reclassified from AOCI to net income (loss) during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAmounts reclassified from\nAOCI \n(a)\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nLocation of impact\nin income statement\nCTA\nReclassification of cumulative translation loss to earnings\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n65\n)\nOther (income) expense, net\nReclassification of cumulative translation loss to earnings from BPS divestiture\n—\n \n(\n185\n)\n$\n—\n \nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n—\n \n(\n185\n)\n(\n65\n)\nTotal before tax\nLess: Tax effect\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n185\n)\n$\n(\n65\n)\nNet of tax\nPension and OPEB items\nAmortization of net losses and prior service costs or credits\n$\n6\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n(\n30\n)\nOther (income) expense, net\nSettlement charges\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n1\n)\nOther (income) expense, net\nPension settlement from BPS divestiture\n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n6\n \n20\n \n(\n31\n)\nTotal before tax\nLess: Tax effect\n(\n2\n)\n(\n5\n)\n6\n \nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n4\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n(\n25\n)\nNet of tax\nGains (losses) on hedging activities\n \nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n8\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n26\n \nCost of sales\nInterest rate contracts\n(\n6\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n6\n)\nInterest expense, net\nFair value hedges\n(\n5\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \nOther (income) expense, net\n(\n3\n)\n7\n \n20\n \nTotal before tax\nLess: Tax effect\n1\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n5\n)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n6\n \n$\n15\n \nNet of tax\nTotal reclassifications for the period\n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n164\n)\n$\n(\n75\n)\nTotal net of tax\n(a)\nAmounts in parentheses indicate reductions to net income.\nRefer to Note 4 for additional information regarding the reclassification of a cumulative translation loss to earnings, Note 13 for additional information regarding the amortization of pension and OPEB items and Note 16 for additional information regarding hedging activity.\nNOTE 11\nREVENUES\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in the recognition of trade accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, contract assets, and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on our consolidated balance sheets. Net trade accounts receivable was $\n1.54\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFor contract manufacturing arrangements, revenue is primarily recognized throughout the production cycle, which typically lasts up to \n90\n days, resulting in the recognition of contract assets until the related services are completed and the customers are billed. Additionally, for certain arrangements containing a performance obligation to deliver software that can be used with medical devices, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software, which results in the recognition of contract assets when customers are billed over time, generally over \none\n to \nfive years\n. For \n98\nbundled contracts involving equipment delivered up-front and consumable medical products to be delivered over time, total contract revenue is allocated between the equipment and consumable medical products. In certain of those arrangements, a contract asset is created for the difference between the amount of equipment revenue recognized upon delivery and the amount of consideration initially receivable from the customer. In those arrangements, the contract asset becomes a trade account receivable as consumable medical products are provided and billed, generally over \none\n to \nseven years\n. \nThe following table summarizes our contract assets:\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nContract manufacturing services\n$\n2\n \n$\n4\n \nSoftware sales\n44\n \n45\n \nBundled equipment and consumable medical products contracts\n87\n \n116\n \nContract assets\n$\n133\n \n$\n165\n \nContract liabilities represent deferred revenues that arise as a result of cash received from customers or where the timing of billing for services precedes satisfaction of our performance obligations. Such remaining performance obligations represent the portion of the contract price for which work has not been performed and are primarily related to our installation and service contracts. We expect to satisfy the majority of the remaining performance obligations and recognize revenue related to installation and service contracts within the next 12 months with most of the non-current performance obligations satisfied within 24 months. \nThe following table summarizes contract liability activity for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

These efforts include restructuring the organization, optimizing the manufacturing footprint, R&D operations and supply chain network, employing disciplined cost management and centralizing and streamlining certain support functions. We currently expect to incur additional pre-tax cash costs, primarily related to the implementation of business optimization programs, of approximately $\n4\n million through the completion of initiatives that are currently underway. We continue to pursue cost savings initiatives, including those intended to mitigate a portion of the dis-synergies expected to arise as a result of the sale of our Kidney Care business, and to the extent further cost savings opportunities are identified, we would incur additional restructuring charges and costs to implement business optimization programs in future periods.

We plan to use a \n6.65\n% assumption for our U.S. and Puerto Rico plans for 2025.\nPension Plan Assets\nAn investment committee of members of senior management is responsible for supervising, monitoring and evaluating the invested assets of our funded pension plans. The investment committee, which meets at least quarterly, abides by documented policies and procedures relating to investment goals, targeted asset allocations, risk management practices, allowable and prohibited investment holdings, diversification, use of derivatives, the relationship between plan assets and benefit obligations, and other relevant factors and considerations.\nThe investment committee’s policies and procedures include the following:\n•\nAbility to pay all benefits when due;\n•\nTargeted long-term performance expectations relative to applicable market indices, such as Russell, MSCI EAFE, and other indices;\n•\nTargeted asset allocation percentage ranges (summarized below), and periodic reviews of these allocations;\n•\nDiversification of assets among third-party investment managers, and by geography, industry, stage of business cycle and other measures;\n•\nSpecified investment holding and transaction prohibitions (for example, private placements or other restricted securities, securities that are not traded in a sufficiently active market, short sales, certain derivatives, commodities and margin transactions);\n•\nSpecified portfolio percentage limits on holdings in a single corporate or other entity (generally \n5\n% at time of purchase, except for holdings in U.S. government or agency securities);\n•\nSpecified average credit quality for the fixed-income securities portfolio (at least A- by Standard & Poor’s or A3 by Moody’s);\n•\nSpecified portfolio percentage limits on foreign holdings; and\n•\nPeriodic monitoring of investment manager performance and adherence to the investment committee’s policies.\nPlan assets are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and exceed the planned benchmark \n105\ninvestment return. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on consideration of plan liabilities, the plans’ funded status and other factors, such as the plans’ demographics and liability durations. Investment performance is reviewed by the investment committee on a quarterly basis and asset allocations are reviewed at least annually.\nPlan assets are managed in a balanced portfolio comprised of two major components: return-seeking investments and liability hedging investments. The target allocations for plan assets are \n50\n% in return-seeking investments and \n50\n% in liability hedging investments and other holdings. The documented policy includes an allocation range based on each individual investment type within the major components that allows for a variance from the target allocations depending on the investment type. Return-seeking investments primarily include common stock of U.S. and international companies, common/collective trust funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and partnership investments. Liability hedging investments and other holdings primarily include cash, money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less, U.S. and foreign government and governmental agency issues, corporate bonds, municipal securities, derivative contracts and asset-backed securities.\nWhile the investment committee provides oversight over plan assets for U.S. and international plans, the summary above is specific to the plans in the United States. The plan assets for international plans are managed and allocated by the entities in each country, with input and oversight provided by the investment committee. The plan assets for the U.S. and international plans are included in the table below.\nThe following tables summarize our pension plan financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\nQuoted prices\nin active\nmarkets for\nidentical assets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nother\nobservable\ninputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nunobservable\ninputs\n(Level 3)\nMeasured at NAV (a)\nAssets\nCash\n$\n52\n \nFixed income securities\nCash equivalents\n$\n179\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n179\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nU.S. government and government agency issues\n135\n \n—\n \n135\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCorporate bonds\n357\n \n—\n \n357\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEquity securities\nCommon stock\n353\n \n353\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nMutual funds\n199\n \n199\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\nCommon/collective trust funds\n540\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n540\n \nPartnership investments\n198\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n198\n \nOther holdings\n215\n \n9\n \n79\n \n127\n \n—\n \nFair value of pension plan assets\n$\n2,228\n \n$\n561\n \n$\n750\n \n$\n127\n \n$\n738\n \n(a) Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n106\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\nQuoted prices\nin active\nmarkets for\nidentical assets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nother\nobservable\ninputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nunobservable\ninputs\n(Level 3)\nMeasured at NAV (a)\nAssets\nCash\n$\n60\n \nFixed income securities\nCash equivalents\n$\n399\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n399\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nU.S. government and government agency issues\n95\n \n—\n \n95\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCorporate bonds\n265\n \n—\n \n265\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEquity securities\nCommon stock\n344\n \n344\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nMutual funds\n192\n \n192\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\nCommon/collective trust funds\n540\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n540\n \nPartnership investments\n216\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n216\n \nOther holdings\n239\n \n12\n \n72\n \n155\n \n—\n \nFair value of pension plan assets\n$\n2,350\n \n$\n548\n \n$\n831\n \n$\n155\n \n$\n756\n \n(a) Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of changes in fair value measurements that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).\n(in millions)\nOther\nholdings\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n7\n \nPurchases\n1\n148\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n155\n \nUnrealized gains (losses)\n(\n24\n)\nSales\n(\n7\n)\nPurchases\n3\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n127\n \n1 \nPurchases in 2023 included $\n148\n million for an insurance contract buy-in related to our pension plan in the United Kingdom.\n \n107\nThe assets and liabilities of our pension plans are valued using the following valuation methods:\nInvestment category\nValuation methodology\nCash equivalents\nThese largely consist of a short-term investment fund, U.S. Dollars and foreign currency. The fair value of the short-term investment fund is based on the net asset value.\nU.S. government and government agency issues\nValues are based on reputable pricing vendors, who typically use pricing matrices or models that use observable inputs.\nCorporate bonds\nValues are based on reputable pricing vendors, who typically use pricing matrices or models that use observable inputs.\nCommon stock\nValues are based on the closing prices on the valuation date in an active market on national and international stock exchanges.\nMutual funds\nValues are based on the net asset value of the units held in the respective fund which are obtained from national and international exchanges or based on the net asset value of the underlying assets of the fund provided by the fund manager.\nCommon/collective trust funds\nValues are based on the net asset value of the units held at year end.\nPartnership investments\nValues are based on the net asset value of the participation by us in the investment as determined by the general partner or investment manager of the respective partnership.\nOther holdings\nOther holdings includes assets valued by pricing vendors using pricing matrices or models that use observable inputs and an insurance contract held by our pension plan in the United Kingdom, which is measured using a discounted cash flow model. In addition to observable market inputs such as interest rates, the fair value measurement of the insurance contract also reflects unobservable inputs, such as qualitative judgments about pricing of similar contracts in the insurance market.\nExpected Pension and OPEB Plan Funding\nOur funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that we may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by us, and other factors. Volatility in the global financial markets could have an unfavorable impact on future funding requirements. In 2025, we have no obligation to fund our principal plans in the United States, but we regularly reassess the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions. Conversely, we do expect to make contributions of at least $\n26\n million to our Puerto Rico plan and $\n7\n million to our foreign pension plans in 2025. Additionally, we expect to have net cash outflows relating to our OPEB plans of approximately $\n16\n million in 2025.\nThe following table details the funded status percentage of our pension plans as of December 31, 2024, including certain plans that are unfunded in accordance with the guidelines of our funding policy outlined above.\nUnited States and Puerto Rico\nInternational\nas of December 31, 2024 (in millions)\nQualified\nplans\nNonqualified\nplan\nFunded\nplans\nUnfunded\nplans\nTotal\nFair value of plan assets\n$\n1,763\n \n$              n/a\n$\n465\n \n$              n/a\n$\n2,228\n \nPBO\n2,015\n \n183\n \n518\n \n33\n \n2,749\n \nFunded status percentage\n87\n \n%\nn/a\n90\n \n%\nn/a\n81\n \n%\nPension Plan Amendments\nIn May 2022, we announced that the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active non-bargaining participants in our U.S. Hillrom pension plan would freeze as of December 31, 2022. Years of additional service earned and eligible compensation received after December 31, 2022 will not be included in the determination of the benefits payable to those participants. This change resulted in an $\n11\n million decline in the \n108\nprojected benefit obligation (PBO) with an offsetting curtailment gain included within other (income) expense, net on the consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nU.S. Defined Contribution Plan\nMost U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a qualified defined contribution plan. We recognized expense of $\n119\n million in 2024, $\n116\n million in 2023 and $\n96\n million in 2022 related to contributions to this plan.\nNOTE 14\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Tax Expense (Benefit) by Category\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnited States\n$\n(\n1,499\n)\n$\n(\n1,057\n)\n$\n(\n3,858\n)\nInternational\n1,210\n \n1,299\n \n610\n \nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n$\n(\n289\n)\n$\n242\n \n$\n(\n3,248\n)\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit) \nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCurrent\nUnited States\nFederal\n$\n19\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n9\n \nState and local\n21\n \n9\n \n—\n \nInternational\n259\n \n307\n \n116\n \nCurrent income tax expense (benefit)\n299\n \n317\n \n125\n \nDeferred\nUnited States\nFederal\n(\n197\n)\n(\n123\n)\n(\n264\n)\nState and local\n(\n21\n)\n(\n25\n)\n(\n49\n)\nInternational\n(\n44\n)\n(\n108\n)\n53\n \nDeferred income tax expense (benefit)\n(\n262\n)\n(\n256\n)\n(\n260\n)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n37\n \n$\n61\n \n$\n(\n135\n)\n109\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nDeferred tax assets\nAccrued liabilities and other\n$\n310\n \n$\n282\n \nPension and other postretirement benefits\n131\n \n135\n \nTax credit and net operating loss carryforwards\n750\n \n723\n \nSwiss tax reform net asset basis step-up\n92\n \n157\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n139\n \n140\n \nValuation allowances\n(\n536\n)\n(\n584\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets\n886\n \n853\n \nDeferred tax liabilities\nSubsidiaries’ unremitted earnings\n21\n \n81\n \nLong-lived assets and other\n632\n \n783\n \nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n132\n \n131\n \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n785\n \n995\n \nNet deferred tax asset (liability)\n$\n101\n \n$\n(\n142\n)\nAt December 31, 2024, we had U.S. state operating loss carryforwards totaling $\n58\n million, U.S. federal operating loss carryforwards totaling $\n13\n million and tax credit carryforwards totaling $\n282\n million, which includes a U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward of $\n184\n million. The U.S. federal and state operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expire between 2025 and 2044, with $\n14\n million of the operating loss carryforwards having no expiration date. \nAt December 31, 2024, with respect to our operations outside the U.S., we had foreign operating loss carryforwards totaling $\n74\n million and foreign tax credit carryforwards totaling $\n14\n million. The foreign operating loss carryforwards expire between 2025 and 2041 with $\n50\n million having no expiration date. A\nll of the foreign tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date.\nRealization of the U.S. and foreign operating loss and tax credit carryforwards depends on generating sufficient future earnings. A valuation allowance of $\n536\n million and $\n584\n million was recognized as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to reduce the deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards because we do not believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be fully realized prior to expiration. \nAfter evaluating relevant U.S. tax laws, any elections or other opportunities that may be available and the future expiration of certain U.S. tax provisions that will impact the utilization of our U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, management expects to be able to realize some, but not all, of the U.S. foreign tax credit deferred tax assets up to its recurring and non-recurring foreign inclusions. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $\n131\n million and $\n130\n million was recognized with respect to the foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We will continue to evaluate the need for additional valuation allowances and, as circumstances change, the valuation allowance may change.\nAs a result of Swiss tax reform legislation enacted during 2019, we recognized an $\n863\n million net asset tax basis step-up that is amortizable as a tax deduction ratably over tax years 2025 through 2029. A deferred tax asset of $\n92\n million and $\n157\n million for the tax basis step-up was recognized as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to realize some, but not all, of the Swiss deferred tax assets for that tax basis step-up based on expected future earnings generated by our Swiss subsidiary during the period in which the tax basis will be amortized. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $\n42\n million and $\n90\n million was recognized on the Swiss deferred tax assets for the tax basis step-up as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an adjustment to the tax rate originally applied to the Swiss net asset tax basis step-up, and as a result recorded a net tax expense of $\n25\n million to decrease the deferred tax asset by $\n59\n million and the related valuation allowance by $\n34\n million as of December 31, 2024. We evaluated the impact on prior periods and determined the impact was immaterial.\n110\nThe following table is a summary of changes in our deferred tax valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at beginning of period\n$\n584\n \n$\n631\n \n$\n326\n \nCharged to income tax expense\n48\n \n87\n \n313\n \nDeductions\n(\n73\n)\n(\n139\n)\n(\n1\n)\nCurrency translation adjustments\n(\n23\n)\n5\n \n(\n7\n)\nBalance at end of period\n$\n536\n \n$\n584\n \n$\n631\n \n \nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit) Reconciliation\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome tax expense (benefit) at U.S. statutory rate\n$\n(\n61\n)\n$\n51\n \n$\n(\n682\n)\nTax incentives\n(\n176\n)\n(\n200\n)\n(\n156\n)\nState and local taxes, net of federal benefit\n(\n9\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n27\n)\nImpact of foreign taxes\n137\n \n190\n \n78\n \nNon-deductible goodwill impairments\n86\n \n—\n \n591\n \nNotional interest deduction expense (benefit)\n(\n37\n)\n31\n \n(\n306\n)\nValuation allowances\n(\n25\n)\n(\n51\n)\n312\n \nStock compensation (windfall) shortfall tax expense (benefit)\n9\n \n10\n \n(\n4\n)\nResearch and development tax credits\n(\n19\n)\n(\n17\n)\n(\n8\n)\nUncertain tax positions\n9\n \n6\n \n(\n7\n)\nUnutilized foreign tax credits\n15\n \n32\n \n32\n \nSubpart F income\n18\n \n26\n \n11\n \nForeign tax credits\n(\n5\n)\n(\n7\n)\n4\n \nPillar Two taxes\n11\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRevaluation of Swiss basis step-up deferred tax asset\n58\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTax law changes on Section 987\n17\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther, net\n9\n \n(\n8\n)\n27\n \nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n37\n \n$\n61\n \n$\n(\n135\n)\nOur effective income tax rate can differ from the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate due to a number of factors, including tax incentives, foreign rate differences, state income taxes, non-deductible expenses, non-taxable income, increases or decreases in valuation allowances and liabilities for uncertain tax positions, excess tax benefits or shortfalls on stock compensation awards, audit developments and legislative changes.\n \nIn 2024, the difference between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate was adversely impacted by a non-deductible impairment of goodwill and legislative changes under IRC Section 987 (which is the exchange gain or loss on foreign branch remittances in the U.S., effective in 2024), and a net revaluation of the Swiss basis step-up deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance that arose from Swiss tax reform legislation in 2019, partially offset by a favorable geographic earnings mix, a decrease in valuation allowance mainly related to U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward, and a tax benefit related to research and development tax credits.\nIn 2023, our effective income tax rate was impacted favorably by geographic earnings mix, a $\n50\n million net tax benefit after related valuation allowances from notional interest deductions that are received by certain wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries that have financed their operations with equity capital and a $\n17\n million tax benefit related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by tax shortfalls on stock compensation awards.\nIn 2022, our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by non-deductible impairments of goodwill acquired in the Hillrom acquisition and valuation allowance increases, including the increase described above related to \n111\ndeferred tax assets from a tax basis step-up that arose from Swiss tax reform legislation in 2019. Those items were partially offset by a $\n47\n million net tax benefit after related valuation allowances from notional interest deductions.  \nWe plan to repatriate our foreign earnings with the exception of approximately $\n607\n million of accumulated earnings that are indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2024 related to \nthree\n of our foreign operations.  Additional withholding and capital gain taxes of $\n70\n million would be incurred if such earnings were remitted currently.\nOur tax provisions for 2024, 2023 and 2022 do not include any significant tax charges related to either the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) or Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions, except for the inability to fully utilize foreign tax credits against such GILTI. Our accounting policy is to recognize any GILTI charge as a period cost.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nWe classify interest and penalties associated with income taxes in income tax expense (benefit) within the consolidated statements of income (loss). Net interest and penalties recognized were not significant during 2024, 2023 and 2022. The liability recognized related to interest and penalties was $\n21\n million and $\n17\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate are $\n51\n million, $\n47\n million and $\n31\n million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our gross unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced within the next 12 months by $\n13\n million.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of our unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nas of and for the years ended (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at beginning of the year\n$\n89\n \n$\n87\n \n$\n106\n \nIncrease associated with tax positions taken during the current year\n10\n \n9\n \n11\n \nIncrease (decrease) associated with tax positions taken during a prior year\n5\n \n3\n \n14\n \nSettlements\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n7\n)\nDecrease associated with lapses in statutes of limitations\n(\n7\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n37\n)\nBalance at end of the year\n$\n96\n \n$\n89\n \n$\n87\n \nOf the gross unrecognized tax benefits, $\n39\n million and $\n33\n million were recognized as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nTax Incentives\nWe have received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Dominican Republic, and Costa Rica. The financial impact of the reductions as compared to the statutory tax rates is indicated in the income tax expense (benefit) reconciliation table above. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings (loss) per diluted share by $\n0.34\n in 2024, $\n0.39\n in 2023 and $\n0.31\n in 2022. The above grants provide that our manufacturing operations are and will be partially exempt from local taxes with varying expirations from 2024 to 2034.\nExaminations of Tax Returns\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had ongoing audits in the United States, Germany, Italy and other jurisdictions. During 2022, we closed U.S. tax years 2017-2018 with the IRS with no material adjustments to our financial statements. Tax years 2019 and 2020 remain under examination by the IRS, including with respect to transfer pricing matters, and tax years 2012 and forward remain under examination by various foreign taxing authorities.  While the final outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain, we believe we have made adequate tax provisions for all years subject to examination.\n112\nNOTE 15\nEARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe numerator for both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS) is net income (loss) attributable to Baxter stockholders. The denominator for basic EPS is the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs is reflected in the denominator for diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Baxter stockholders.\nyears ended December 31(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\n$\n(\n326\n)\n$\n181\n \n$\n(\n3,113\n)\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests included in continuing operations\n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Baxter stockholders\n(\n326\n)\n181\n \n(\n3,114\n)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations\n(\n312\n)\n2,482\n \n692\n \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests included in discontinued operations\n11\n \n7\n \n11\n \nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to Baxter stockholders\n(\n323\n)\n2,475\n \n681\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to Baxter stockholders\n$\n(\n649\n)\n$\n2,656\n \n$\n(\n2,433\n)\nThe following table is a reconciliation of basic shares to diluted shares.\nyears ended December 31(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBasic shares\n510\n \n506\n \n504\n \nEffect of dilutive securities\n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \nDiluted shares\n510\n \n508\n \n504\n \nBasic and diluted shares are the same for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022 due to our loss from continuing operations attributable to Baxter stockholders. The effect of dilutive securities includes unexercised stock options, unvested RSUs and contingently issuable shares related to granted PSUs. The computation of diluted EPS excludes \n25\n million, \n19\n million, and \n22\n million equity awards in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted EPS. Refer to Note 9 for additional information regarding items impacting basic shares.\nNOTE 16\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nWe invest excess cash in certificates of deposit or money market or other funds and diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions. With respect to financial instruments, where appropriate, we have diversified our selection of counterparties, and have arranged collateralization and master-netting agreements to minimize the risk of loss.\nGlobal economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. Global economic conditions, governmental actions and customer-specific factors may require us to re-evaluate the collectability of our receivables and we could potentially incur additional credit losses. \nForeign Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management\nWe operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. Our hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs.\n113\nWe are primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the  Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Mexican Peso, Indian Rupee and Swedish Krona. We manage our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In addition, we use derivative and nonderivative instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange risk. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and equity volatility resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates. Financial market and currency volatility may limit our ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.\nWe are also exposed to the risk that our earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. Our policy is to manage interest costs using the mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt that we believe is appropriate at that time. To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, we periodically enter into interest rate swaps in which we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount.\nWe do not hold any instruments for trading purposes and none of our outstanding derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe may use options, including collars and purchased options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. We periodically use treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with movements in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of debt. \nThe notional amounts of foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges were $\n99\n million and $\n340\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The maximum term over which we have cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at December 31, 2024 is \n11\n months for foreign exchange contracts. There were \nno\n outstanding interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe periodically use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. These instruments hedge our earnings from changes in the fair value of debt due to fluctuations in the designated benchmark interest rate.\nThere were \nno\n outstanding interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  \nIn October 2023, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a notional amount of $\n798\n million and designated that derivative as a fair value hedge of our €\n750\n million of \n0.40\n% senior notes due May 2024. This forward contract matured in May 2024.\nNet Investment Hedges\nIn May 2017, we issued €\n600\n million of \n1.3\n% senior notes due May 2025. In May 2019, we issued €\n750\n million of \n1.3\n% senior notes due May 2029. We have designated these debt obligations as hedges of our net investment in our European operations and, as a result, mark to spot rate adjustments of the outstanding debt balances are recorded as a component of AOCI. \nIn May 2019, we issued €\n750\n million of \n0.40\n% senior notes due May 2024, which we repaid in full on their maturity date. We had designated these debt obligations as hedges of our investment in our European operations and, as a result, mark to spot rate adjustments of the outstanding debt balances were previously recorded as a component of AOCI. In October 2023, we dedesignated this previously designated net investment hedge and concurrently entered into a fair value hedging relationship as discussed in the “Fair Value Hedges” section above. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated pre-tax unrealized translation gain in AOCI of $\n124\n million related to the Euro-denominated senior notes.\n114\nDedesignations\nIf it is determined that a derivative or nonderivative hedging instrument is no longer highly effective as a hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Gains or losses relating to terminations of effective cash flow hedges generally continue to be deferred and are recognized consistent with the loss or income recognition of the underlying hedged items. However, if it is probable that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur, any gains or losses would be immediately reclassified from AOCI to earnings. There were \nno\n cash flow hedge dedesignations in 2024, 2023 or 2022 resulting from changes in our assessment of the probability that the hedged forecasted transactions would occur. The losses relating to these terminations continue to be deferred and are being recognized consistent with the underlying hedged item, interest expense on the issuance of debt.\nIf we terminate a fair value hedge, an amount equal to the cumulative fair value adjustment to the hedged item at the date of termination is amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the hedged item. There were \nno\n fair value hedges terminated in 2024, 2023 or 2022. \nIf we remove a net investment hedge designation, any gain or loss recognized in AOCI is not reclassified to earnings until we sell, liquidate, or deconsolidate the foreign investments that were being hedged. In October 2023, we dedesignated one of our net investment hedges as discussed in the \"Net Investment Hedges\" section above. There were \nno\n net investment hedges terminated in 2024 or 2022.\nUndesignated Derivative Instruments\nWe use forward contracts to hedge earnings from the effects of foreign exchange relating to certain of our intra-company and third-party receivables and payables denominated in a foreign currency. These derivative instruments are generally not formally designated as hedges and the terms of these instruments generally do not exceed one month.\nThe total notional amount of undesignated derivative instruments was $\n389\n million and $\n305\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nGains and Losses on Hedging Instruments and Undesignated Derivative Instruments\nThe following tables summarize the gains and losses on our hedging instruments and the classification of those gains and losses within our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n(in millions)\nGain (loss)\nrecognized in OCI\nLocation of gain\n(loss) in\nincome statement\nGain (loss) reclassified from\nAOCI into income\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash flow hedges\nInterest rate contracts\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nInterest expense, net\n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n(\n6\n)\nForeign exchange contracts\n17\n \n15\n \n28\n \nCost of sales\n8\n \n15\n \n26\n \nFair value hedges\nForeign exchange contracts\n(\n3\n)\n(\n4\n)\n—\n \nOther (income) expense, net\n(\n5\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \nNet investment hedges\n87\n \n(\n58\n)\n141\n \nOther (income) expense, net\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n101\n \n$\n(\n47\n)\n$\n169\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n6\n \n$\n20\n \nLocation of gain (loss) in\nincome statement\nGain (loss) recognized\nin income\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFair value hedges\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther (income) expense, net\n$\n(\n24\n)\n$\n38\n \n$\n—\n \nUndesignated derivative instruments\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther (income) expense, net\n(\n13\n)\n2\n \n(\n16\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n37\n)\n$\n40\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\n115\nThe following table summarizes net-of-tax activity in AOCI, a component of stockholders’ equity, related to our cash flow hedges. \nas of and for the year ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balance at beginning of year\n$\n(\n120\n)\n$\n(\n119\n)\n$\n(\n126\n)\n(Loss) gain in fair value of derivatives during the year\n10\n \n5\n \n22\n \nAmount reclassified to earnings during the year\n2\n \n(\n6\n)\n(\n15\n)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balance at end of year\n$\n(\n108\n)\n$\n(\n120\n)\n$\n(\n119\n)\nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n1\n million of deferred, net after-tax gains on derivative instruments included in AOCI are expected to be recognized in earnings during the next 11 months, coinciding with when the hedged items are expected to impact earnings.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table summarizes the classification and fair values of derivative instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.\nDerivatives in asset positions\nDerivatives in liability positions\n(in millions)\nBalance sheet location\nFair value\nBalance sheet location\nFair value\nDerivative instruments designated as hedges\nForeign exchange contracts\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n$\n6\n \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n$\n—\n \nUndesignated derivative instruments\nForeign exchange contracts\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n1\n \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n2\n \nTotal derivative instruments\n$\n7\n \n$\n2\n \nThe following table summarizes the classification and fair values of derivative instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\nDerivatives in asset positions\nDerivatives in liability positions\n(in millions)\nBalance sheet location\nFair value\nBalance sheet location\nFair value\nDerivative instruments designated as hedges\nForeign exchange contracts\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n$\n41\n \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n$\n—\n \nUndesignated derivative instruments\nForeign exchange contracts\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n4\n \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n5\n \nTotal derivative instruments\n$\n45\n \n$\n5\n \nWhile some of our derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements, we present our assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments on a gross basis within the consolidated balance sheets.

A majority of the derivatives entered into by us are valued using internal valuation techniques as no quoted market prices exist for such instruments. The principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flow and Black-Scholes models. The key inputs, which are considered observable and vary depending on the type of derivative, include contractual terms, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates and volatility.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities, which consist of convertible debt and convertible redeemable preferred shares issued by nonpublic entities, are measured using discounted cash flow and option pricing models. Those available-for-sale debt securities are classified as Level 3 fair value measurements when there are no observable transactions near the balance sheet date due to the lack of observable data over certain fair value inputs such as equity volatility. The fair values of available-for-sale debt securities increase when interest rates decrease, equity volatility increases, or the fair values of the equity shares underlying the conversion options increase.\nContingent payments related to acquisitions, which consist of milestone payments and sales-based payments, are valued using discounted cash flow techniques incorporating management's expectations of future outcomes. The fair value of milestone payments increases as the estimated probability of payment increases or the expected timing of payments is accelerated. The fair value of sales-based payments is based upon probability-weighted future \n118\nrevenue estimates, and increases as revenue estimates increase, probability weighting of higher revenue scenarios increases or the expected timing of payment is accelerated. \nThe following table is a reconciliation of recurring fair value measurements that use significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which consist of contingent payments related to acquisitions and available-for-sale debt securities.\n2024\n2023\nas of and for the years ended December 31 (in millions)\nContingent payments related to acquisitions\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nContingent payments related to acquisitions\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nFair value at beginning of period\n$\n14\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n84\n \n$\n27\n \nChange in fair value recognized in earnings\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n19\n)\n(\n21\n)\nPayments\n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n(\n51\n)\n—\n \nTransfers out of Level 3\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n5\n)\nFair value at end of period\n$\n12\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n1\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, available-for-sale debt securities were reclassified from Level 3, upon conversion to marketable equity securities, which are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, upon initial public offerings of the investees.\nFinancial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value\nIn addition to the financial instruments that we are required to recognize at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, we have certain financial instruments that are recognized at amortized cost or some basis other than fair value. \nFor these financial instruments, the following table provides the values recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and the estimated fair values.\nBook values\nFair values(a)\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nLiabilities\nShort-term debt\n$\n2,126\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,126\n \n$\n—\n \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt and finance lease obligations\n626\n \n2,667\n \n619\n \n2,621\n \nLong-term debt and finance lease obligations\n10,374\n \n11,089\n \n9,295\n \n10,026\n \n(a)    These fair value amounts are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as they are estimated based on observable inputs.\nThe carrying value of short-term debt approximates its fair value due to the short-term maturities of the obligations. The estimated fair values of current and long-term debt were computed by multiplying price by the notional amount of the respective debt instruments. Price is calculated using the stated terms of the respective debt instrument and yield curves commensurate with our credit risk. The carrying values of other financial instruments not presented in the table above, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of most of those assets and liabilities.\nThe carrying values of equity investments without readily determinable fair values that we measure at cost, less impairment were $\n37\n million and $\n33\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. When applicable, we also adjust the measurement of such equity investments for observable prices in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. These investments are included in Other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\n \n119\nNOTE 18\nSEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nOur business is comprised of \nthree\n reportable segments: Medical Products & Therapies, Healthcare Systems & Technologies, and Pharmaceuticals. The Medical Products & Therapies segment includes sales of our sterile IV solutions, infusion systems, administration sets, parenteral nutrition therapies and surgical hemostat, sealant and adhesion prevention products. The Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment includes sales of our connected care solutions and collaboration tools, including smart bed systems, patient monitoring systems and diagnostic technologies, respiratory health devices and advanced equipment for the surgical space, including operating room integration technologies, precision positioning devices, and other accessories. The Pharmaceuticals segment includes sales of specialty injectable pharmaceuticals, inhaled anesthetics and drug compounding services. Other sales not allocated to a segment primarily include sales of products and services provided directly through certain of our manufacturing facilities and royalty income under a business development arrangement that ended in early 2023 when we acquired the related product rights.\nDisaggregation of Net Sales\nThe following tables present our U.S. and International disaggregated net sales.\nfor the years ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nU.S.\nInternational\nTotal\nU.S.\nInternational\nTotal\nU.S.\nInternational\nTotal\nInfusion Therapies & Technologies\n$\n2,279\n \n$\n1,824\n \n$\n4,103\n \n$\n2,227\n \n$\n1,733\n \n$\n3,960\n \n$\n2,241\n \n$\n1,576\n \n$\n3,817\n \nAdvanced Surgery\n603\n \n501\n \n1,104\n \n582\n \n469\n \n1,051\n \n574\n \n424\n \n998\n \nMedical Products & Therapies\n2,882\n \n2,325\n \n5,207\n \n2,809\n \n2,202\n \n5,011\n \n2,815\n \n2,000\n \n4,815\n \nCare and Connectivity Solutions\n1,311\n \n503\n \n1,814\n \n1,263\n \n537\n \n1,800\n \n1,295\n \n496\n \n1,791\n \nFront Line Care\n843\n \n294\n \n1,137\n \n905\n \n308\n \n1,213\n \n840\n \n308\n \n1,148\n \nHealthcare Systems & Technologies\n2,154\n \n797\n \n2,951\n \n2,168\n \n845\n \n3,013\n \n2,135\n \n804\n \n2,939\n \nInjectables and Anesthesia\n780\n \n593\n \n1,373\n \n759\n \n588\n \n1,347\n \n682\n \n623\n \n1,305\n \nDrug Compounding\n—\n \n1,038\n \n1,038\n \n—\n \n902\n \n902\n \n—\n \n821\n \n821\n \nPharmaceuticals\n780\n \n1,631\n \n2,411\n \n759\n \n1,490\n \n2,249\n \n682\n \n1,444\n \n2,126\n \nOther\n1\n34\n \n33\n \n67\n \n66\n \n21\n \n87\n \n137\n \n40\n \n177\n \nTotal Baxter\n$\n5,850\n \n$\n4,786\n \n$\n10,636\n \n$\n5,802\n \n$\n4,558\n \n$\n10,360\n \n$\n5,769\n \n$\n4,288\n \n$\n10,057\n \n1\n In connection with the reclassification of our BPS business to discontinued operations during the second quarter of 2023, we reclassified $\n2\n million of contract manufacturing revenues from the first quarter of 2023 and $\n37\n million of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 from BPS to Other (within continuing operations), as the related manufacturing facility was not part of that divestiture transaction.\n \n120\nGeographic Information\nOur net sales are attributed to the following geographic regions based on the location of the customer. \nfor the years ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet sales:\nUnited States\n$\n5,850\n \n$\n5,802\n \n$\n5,769\n \nEmerging markets\n1\n1,350\n \n1,343\n \n1,253\n \nRest of world \n2\n3,436\n \n3,215\n \n3,035\n \nTotal net sales\n$\n10,636\n \n$\n10,360\n \n$\n10,057\n \n1\n \nEmerging markets include sales from our operations in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia (except for Japan).\n2\n Rest of world includes sales from our operations in Western Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\nOur property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, net are attributed to the following geographic regions.\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nProperty, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, net:\nUnited States\n$\n1,654\n \n$\n1,615\n \nEmerging markets\n793\n \n829\n \nRest of world \n729\n \n763\n \nTotal property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, net\n$\n3,176\n \n$\n3,207\n \nSegment Information\nOur chief operating decision maker who has been identified as our Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, reviews the financial information presented for purposes of evaluating the performance of our segments and to make resource allocation decisions. \nSegment operating income is the measure of segment profitability and represents income before income taxes, interest and other non-operating income or expense, unallocated corporate costs, intangible asset amortization and other special items. Special items, which are presented below in our reconciliations of segment operating income to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, are excluded from segment operating income because they are highly variable, difficult to predict and of a size that may substantially impact our reported results of operations for the period. \nCorporate costs, inclusive of global functional support costs, overhead costs and other shared costs that benefit our segments are allocated to those segments. Corporate costs that are not allocated to our segments, as well as any differences between actual corporate costs and the amounts allocated to our segments, are presented as unallocated corporate costs. With the results of our former Kidney Care segment reported in discontinued operations, corporate costs that had previously been allocated to the Kidney Care segment which did not convey with the Kidney Care segment in the completed sale are now presented as unallocated corporate costs. \nSegment results include net sales, cost of sales, selling general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, and other segment items which are directly allocated to each segment.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance \n126\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \nGoodwill Impairment Assessment – Front Line Care Reporting Unit\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance as of December 31, 2024 was $5.3 billion, and the goodwill associated with the Front Line Care reporting unit was $1.99 billion. Management performs an impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount. If management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or they do not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, they perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the quantitative impairment test, management calculates the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded. The fair values of the Company’s reporting units are generally determined based on a discounted cash flow model (an income approach) and earnings multiples (a market approach) based on the guideline public company method. Significant assumptions in reporting unit fair value measurements generally include revenue growth rates, forecasted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins, discount rates, terminal growth rates and earnings multiples. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment assessment, management recorded a $425 million goodwill impairment related to the Front Line Care reporting unit.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Front Line Care reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rate, forecasted EBITDA margin, discount rate, and terminal growth rate used in the discounted cash flow model and earnings multiples used in the earnings multiples approach; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Front Line Care reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Front Line Care reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and the earnings multiples approach used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow model and the earnings multiples approach; (iv) and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the revenue growth rate, forecasted EBITDA margin, discount rate, terminal growth rate and earnings multiples. Evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rate and forecasted EBITDA margin involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Front Line Care reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the \n127\ndiscounted cash flow model and the earnings multiples approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate, terminal growth rate and earnings multiples assumptions.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 21, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1985. \n128\nItem 9.    \nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A.    \nControls and Procedures. \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is communicated to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024. \nManagement’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the framework in \nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment under the framework in \nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.    \nOther Information.\nCertain of our officers and directors have made elections to participate in, and are participating in, our employee stock purchase plan or have made, and may from time to time make, elections to have shares withheld to cover withholding taxes or pay the exercise price of options, which may constitute non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).\nItem 9C.    \nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\nNot Applicable.\n129\nPART III\nItem 10.    \nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\nRefer to information under the captions entitled “Corporate Governance at Baxter International Inc. — Proposal 1 — Election of Directors,” “— Board of Directors — Nomination of Directors,” “— Committees of the Board — Audit Committee,” “— Board Responsibilities — Code of Conduct,” “Ownership of Baxter Stock — Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports” and \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Additional Compensation Governance — Prohibitions on Trading; No-Hedging\" in Baxter’s definitive proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders expected to be held on May 6, 2025 (the Proxy Statement), all of which information is incorporated herein by reference.
