  "item1_summary": " Investors should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results . BXP is one of the largest publicly traded office real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the United States . Our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets in the U.S. - Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington .\n BPLP is the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business . We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing premier workplaces to our clients . We consider the creditworthiness of the client and the industry in which it conducts business, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the amount of any security deposit or letter of credit posted by the client .\n We do not consider the expression “premier workplaces” a classification of our properties in accordance with any standard listing criteria in the real estate industry . Our core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and manage premier workplaces in gateway markets with high barriers-to-entry and attractive demand drivers . We believe this strategy provides a competitive advantage that helps BXP distinguish itself from competitors .\n As of December 31, 2024, these CBD assets are 90.9% occupied and 92.8% leased . BXP’s portfolio has consistently outperformed the broader office market in those CBDs . The important market forces impacting BXP continue to be corporate earnings growth, return-to-office behavior, limited new development starts and the outperformance of premier workplaces .\n Inflation rose in the last three months of 2024 to 2.9%, inflation rose above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and the December 2024 employment data indicated new job creation exceeded market expectations . The Federal Reserve has become more cautious, lowering its forecast of Federal funds rate cuts in 2025 . We expect short-term interest rates to remain lower in 2025 compared to 2024 .\n In light of the uncertain trajectory of the U.S. and global economies, we continue to position BXP for success by ensuring ample liquidity, managing our leverage, pursuing additional capital raising opportunities . Despite broader market improvements as lenders remain focused on top-tier sponsorship and derisked financing opportunities, BXP continues to focus on premier workplace opportunities .\n The following is an overview of leasing and investment activity in the fourth quarter of 2024 and recent business highlights . BXP executed 83 leases totaling more than 2.3 million square feet with a weighted-average lease term of approximately 10.3 years .

We record acquired “above-” and “below-market” leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired)\n Management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable . At acquisition, the total net equity acquired for 901 New York Avenue was $20.0 million, which includes $10.0 million in cash that we paid for the joint venture partner's 50% economic ownership interest .\n An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value . The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates . The impairment loss of approximately $13.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 .\n As of December 31, 2024, the net carrying amounts of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was approximately $1.1 billion .

The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in lease revenue from our clients and depreciation and amortization expense related to new and expiring clients . Property is held for future development. Property was fully placed in service on October 31, 2024. Property is currently in development.\n We expect to fund our current development/redevelopment projects primarily with our available cash balances, funding from institutional private equity partners, construction loans, and construction loans . The company expects to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: cash flow from operations, distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; borrowings under BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility, unsecured term loans, short-term bridge facilities and construction .\n We use BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness, fund short-term development costs and for working capital . We also use the facility to backstop our commercial paper program . The source of financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project's size and duration, and the extent of pre-leasing .\n We acquired 725 12th Street on December 27, 2024 for a purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of $34.0 million .

There are provisions in the majority of our client leases that protect us from, and mitigate, the impact of inflation . We have not sold any shares under BXP’s $600.0 million “at the market” equity offering program .\n REIT policy is for BXP to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax .

The Company also considers an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases .\n An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value . The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates .

For ventures that are not VIEs, the Company consolidates entities for which it has significant decision making control over the ventures’ operations .\n The Company’s share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations .

The Company receives reimbursements of payroll and payroll-related costs from unconsolidated joint venture entities and third-party property owners in connection with management services contracts .\n The revenue is derived from special events and services provided to the public .

These leases may contain extension and termination options that are predominately at the sole discretion of the tenant, provided certain conditions are satisfied .\n Per ASC 842, lessors do not need to separate nonlease components from the associated lease component if certain criteria are met for each class of underlying assets . Nonlease components are distinct elements of a contract that are not related to securing the use of the leased asset and revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606 .\n The Company made a policy election to account for and present the lease component and the nonlease component as a single component in the revenue section of the Consolidated Statements of Operations labeled Lease . The Company recognizes these reimbursements on a gross basis, as the Company obtains control of the goods and services before they are transferred to the tenant . Interest income is recognized under the effective interest method .\n Basic earnings per common unit is computed by dividing net income available, as adjusted for undistributed earnings (if any) of certain securities issued by BPLP, by the weighted average number of common units outstanding during the year .
