Our principal executive offices are located at 2700 Coast Avenue, Mountain View, California, 94043, and our main telephone number is 650-944-6000.

QuickBooks and Intuit Enterprise Suite are offerings powered by our all-in-one business platform which includes financial management services, human capital management solutions such as payroll and time tracking, money solutions, such as merchant payment processing, bill pay, checking accounts through an FDIC-member bank partner, and financing for small and mid-market businesses.

We made an early bet on AI, declaring our AI-driven expert platform strategy in 2019. We have transformed the company from a tax and accounting platform to an AI-driven expert platform. We have a significant competitive advantage with our scale of data, data services, AI capabilities, ecosystem of applications, and our large network of AI-enabled human experts to become the all-in-one platform for consumers, businesses, and accountants. We're disrupting the categories we operate in to drive better money outcomes for our customers.  \nWe leverage AI and human intelligence to provide our customers with done-for-you experiences that automate tasks, identify actionable insights to drive important decisions, and manage end-to-end workflows or entire processes to eliminate work, while ensuring the customer remains in control. When customers need additional help or want help to complete the work on their behalf, we connect them with the best human expert from our network of thousands of AI-enabled financial, tax, and bookkeeping experts who can complete a specific task, address specialized questions, or manage the entire workload. Our strategy, combined with our Big Bets that focus on the largest customer problems and growth opportunities, positions us for durable growth. \nIn fiscal 2025, we launched a transformative set of AI agents that provide customers with a virtual team to complete jobs on their behalf, dramatically improving how businesses run and grow. Combined with our AI-enabled human experts, these agents are automating workflows and delivering real-time insights to drive growth and improve cash flow. Our redesigned user interface and new business feed highlights these real-time insights and recommendations and the tasks completed by agents on behalf of the customer. We also launched AI agents in Intuit Enterprise Suite, including accounting, payments, finance, and project management agents, transforming how our small and mid-market business customers manage their finances by automating a variety of day-to-day tasks, and increasing productivity.\nOur innovation has been possible with the investments in our proprietary Generative AI Operating System (GenOS), which have enabled us to fuel innovation with unparalleled speed for our customers. Built for our internal developers, GenOS not only keeps pace with rapid technological industry advances but is setting the pace—by melding the best of artificial intelligence and human intelligence on our platform. This enables us to rapidly deliver a new class of intelligent, autonomous financial solutions that will define the next decade of growth for our customers and for Intuit. Our AI-driven expert platform and products are built in keeping with the company’s commitment to data privacy, security, and responsible AI governance. We safeguard customer data and protect privacy using industry-leading technology and practices, and adhere to responsible AI principles that guide how we operate and scale our platform with our customers’ best interests in mind. \nAs we execute our global AI-driven expert platform strategy, we prioritize resources on our Big Bets across the company. We have driven significant momentum across the company over the past year. Looking ahead, we are doubling down on the areas that drove strong results this year where the combination of AI and human intelligence delivers done-for-you experiences, helps customers put more money in their pockets, and builds our mid-market business.\nAs the external environment evolves, we continue to innovate and adapt our strategy and anticipate our customers’ needs. For more than 40 years, we have been dedicated to developing innovative solutions that are designed to solve our customers' most important financial problems. At Intuit, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to prosper, and we never stop working to find new, innovative ways to make that possible.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nDuring fiscal 2025, we offered our products and services in the four segments described in \n“Our Business Portfolio”\n above. The following table shows the percentage of total revenue contributed by each of these segments over the last three fiscal years. \nFiscal 2025\nFiscal 2024\nFiscal 2023\nGlobal Business Solutions\n59 \n%\n59 \n%\n56 \n%\nConsumer\n26 \n%\n27 \n%\n29 \n%\nCredit Karma\n12 \n%\n10 \n%\n11 \n%\nProTax\n3 \n%\n4 \n%\n4 \n%\nTotal international net revenue was approximately 8% of consolidated total net revenue in each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023.\nFor financial information about our reportable segments, see \n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\n in Item 7 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n Intuit\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n5\nTable\n of Contents\nGlobal Business Solutions\nOur Global Business Solutions segment serves small and mid-market businesses around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. Our vision is to be the connected all-in-one platform with a virtual team of AI agents and AI-enabled human experts that small and mid-market businesses rely on every day to run and grow their businesses.\nSmall and mid-market business owners are constantly faced with challenges and barriers in their journey to success.

The financing process provides customers with the ability to use their QuickBooks data to qualify to borrow capital, whether from Intuit via our originating bank partner or from partners on our QuickBooks Capital Marketplace.

Our assisted tax products and services, such as TurboTax Live and TurboTax Live Full Service, are designed for customers who seek professional tax advice or who want their returns prepared by an expert. We also offer complementary services, including electronic filing of federal and state income tax returns, faster access to tax refunds, audit defense, and audit support.\nOur online tax preparation, filing, and other services are offered through the websites and mobile apps of thousands of financial institutions, electronic retailers, and other online merchants.

Our professional tax offerings consist of Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada.

To succeed in these markets, continuous investment is required to innovate, develop new products and services, and enhance existing offerings. Our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy.\nWe develop many of our products and services internally, and we have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license products and technology from third parties and establish other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy.\nOur offerings have rapid development cycles. In addition, developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements, and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project.\nWe continue to make substantial investments in research and development. We expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with done-for-you experiences, financial recommendations, personalization, and ease of use enabled by AI and other advanced technologies. We continue to focus on developing new products and services, including global offerings, and undertaking significant research and development for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings.\nSEASONALITY\nOur Consumer and ProTax offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively. \nWe expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProTax businesses to continue to have a material impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.\nMARKETING, SALES, AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS\nMarkets \nOur primary customers are consumers and small and mid-market businesses. We also provide specialized tax and accounting products to professional accountants. We partner with financial institutions and other partners, who we connect with consumers on our platform. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. The widespread usage of mobile devices and social media, along with the evolution of AI, has accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized how customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services.\nReal-time, personalized online shopping experiences are the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, and other changes in the way we do business.\nMarketing Programs\nWe use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales, develop leads, increase general awareness of the Intuit brand and our product portfolio, and drive sales in retail. These programs include offline marketing, such as TV and radio advertising; digital marketing, such as display and pay-per-click advertising, search and generative engine optimization, and social and affiliate marketing; email marketing; in-product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services; public relations; \n8\n Intuit\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nTable\n of Contents\nsponsorships; podcast marketing; mobile marketing; and retail marketing of our consumer tax offerings. Our campaigns are designed to attract new users, retain existing users, and cross-sell additional offerings.\nSales and Distribution Channels\nDirect Channel\n. We offer our products and services directly through our websites, apps, and call centers. Direct online offerings are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase and other decisions regarding our and our partners’ offerings based on content provided on our websites, or via other online content and word-of-mouth recommendations. For many of our products, assisted sales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers who want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on accountants, bookkeepers, and marketing professionals, and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our business and professional tax solutions. We market certain products directly to mid-market businesses through our direct sales force. \nMulti-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences\n.\n Our customers primarily research products and services online. Many customers buy and use our products and services entirely online. Some research online but make their purchase at a retail location. Because many customers shop across multiple channels, we continue to coordinate our online, offline, and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated, multi-channel shop-and-buy model. We also focus on cross-selling complementary Intuit and third-party offerings online and in-product.\nOnline App Stores\n.\n We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices.\nPartner and Other Channels\n. We offer many of our products and services through partners and other channels, including value-added resellers, technology partners with complementary platforms, accountants, bookkeepers, marketing professionals, and professional service providers who help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. These partners combine our products and services with marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. We also sell our TurboTax Desktop offerings at retail locations across the U.S. and Canada and on retailer websites. In Canada, we also rely on distributors who sell products into the retail channel.\nCOMPETITION\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our businesses across all of our offerings. Competition is rapidly evolving, fragmented, and involves complex interdependencies with many businesses. Competitive pressures in many of the market segments we serve have grown markedly over the past few years, and the marketing and distribution channels continue to evolve. We expect these trends to continue. Our competitors may introduce superior products and services, successfully use and deploy new technologies such as AI that may reduce customer demand for our products or services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing, and other resources, have greater brand recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers and partners, advertise aggressively, or beat us to market with new products and services.\nThe competitive landscape is constantly evolving. This occurs as we expand into new market segments and geographic regions and extend our capabilities, as well as when new companies emerge or existing companies extend their capabilities (either directly or through acquisitions or partnerships) to include the market segments and geographic regions in which we operate. Given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global financial technology company and the customer problems that we aim to solve, we compete with offerings from a variety of organizations across a range of industries, including large global companies, smaller geographically focused companies, startups, and professional services. Entities that offer or provide access to offerings that we may compete with include:\n•\nbusiness software providers, including industry-specific vertical software providers and embedded software providers, that offer solutions such as accounting, business management and financial software, marketing automation, customer relationship management, inventory management, payroll and workforce management;\n•\nprivate and publicly-funded tax preparation and filing service providers, including embedded software providers;\n•\naccounting, consulting, and tax firms; \n•\ncompanies and banks that provide money services, including merchant payment processing, bill pay, checking and savings accounts, financing and point of sale devices; \n•\ncompanies that provide personal finance management products and tools, including access to credit scores, credit and identity monitoring, credit-building tools, and tools to help understand net worth and make financial progress;\n•\ncompanies that provide a marketplace of consumer financial offerings;\n•\nfinancial institutions; \n•\ncredit bureaus; and\n•\nplatform companies that could develop competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face.\nWe believe our most important competitive factors are our innovation and technology capabilities, functionality, ease of use, and security of our offerings, the integration of our offerings with each other and third-party offerings, brand recognition and reputation, quality of support, and cost. We believe that we compete favorably based on these factors and our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance. \n Intuit\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n9\nTable\n of Contents\nCUSTOMER SUCCESS\nFor many of our offerings, we provide support through multiple channels including telephone, email, online and video chat, text messaging, our customer support websites, self-help assets embedded in our products, and online communities where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other.\nWe also provide access to experts, through our TurboTax and QuickBooks Live offerings, who provide tax advice, tax preparation, and bookkeeping services.\nOur customer success staff predominantly consists of Intuit-employed and outsourced experts. We supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch. We augment the services we provide with outsourced partnerships domestically and internationally. A majority of our outsourced customer success personnel are based domestically, with additional international teams located primarily in the Philippines and Canada.\nWe also source staff through our Prosperity Hub program, which is designed to spark economic prosperity in underserved communities. One part of this program is our socially responsible sourcing model, where we both directly and through customer success partner-employers, hire, train, and retain workers who deliver support and services for our customers.\nSelf-help information is offered for free in-product and on our support websites for many of our offerings. Support alternatives and fees vary by product. For example, some product subscriptions receive 24/7 support and additional contact channel options.\nMANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION\nOnline Products and Services\nOur online offerings include QuickBooks Online, Intuit Enterprise Suite, online payroll services, merchant payment processing and bill pay services, Mailchimp’s marketing automation and customer relationship offerings, TurboTax Online, ProConnect Tax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, and Credit Karma offerings. We use public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, for most of our systems, networks, and databases used to operate these online offerings.\nDesktop Software and Supplies\nOur desktop software customers generally electronically download software as demand for physical packaged products has declined. When supplies are ordered, we typically ship the physical product within a few days of receiving an order, and backlog is minimal.\nPRIVACY AND SECURITY\nWe host, collect, process, use, and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal data from our customers, users, workforce, and third-party partners. We are stewards of this data and have designed data stewardship principles to align our organization in collecting, using, and protecting such information. As we believe strongly in these principles, we operate our program to comply with laws and regulations that govern our use, sharing, and protection of personal information, including, for example, laws related to financial services and the handling of tax data. We have established guidelines and practices to help ensure members of our workforce are aware of our program and the role they play in protecting this data. Our privacy statements provide notice of our privacy practices, and provide the opportunity for impacted parties to exercise their rights with respect to their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to inform public policy for privacy and security. \nWe use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information that is given to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration. We use technical and procedural measures designed to help detect and prevent fraud and misuse of data. Whenever sensitive information, such as credit card information or tax return data, is transmitted to us through one of our websites or products, we follow current industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us, and when we store it at rest. We routinely patch our systems with security updates and work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products, as well as internally developed technology, security procedures, and practices.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations that add compliance costs, affect how we operate, and may impact our ability to compete. For example, our Consumer and ProTax segments are subject to federal, state, and international government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. Our Global Business Solutions segment offers products and services to small and mid-market businesses and consumers, such as payroll, payments, financing for small and mid-market businesses, and other financial service offerings, which are also subject to certain regulatory \n10\n Intuit\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nTable\n of Contents\nrequirements. Our Credit Karma segment offers personal finance products and services to consumers, such as recommendations of credit card, loan, and insurance products and access to credit scores and reports, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements.

These updates provide a recurring overview of cybersecurity trends and status updates (e.g., security events, fraud detection, IT roadmap progress, follow-up from prior assessments, security awareness exercise results), as well as a more focused analysis on select cybersecurity topics for the month. Examples of prior topics include: recent cybersecurity legislation, cybersecurity incidents affecting external entities, and trends in cybersecurity controls and adoption. As part of our incident response processes, incidents are classified based on the incident’s characteristics. For certain risk-based classifications of incidents, the CEO and other members of the executive leadership team are also informed and contribute as part of our incident response processes.\n \nBOARD OVERSIGHT\nOur full Board of Directors provides ultimate oversight for the cybersecurity program, in addition to other significant risks of Intuit. The Board of Directors has delegated primary oversight of cybersecurity risks to the Audit and Risk Committee. \nOn a quarterly basis, the CISO and CyberCRAFT specialists provide the Audit and Risk Committee with updates, metrics, and trends, such as the status of prior security events, existing and emerging threat landscapes, the results of audits or assessments, fraud prevention efforts, vulnerability detection and disclosure changes, and the status of projects to strengthen our security systems and improve incident readiness, and how these may affect broader enterprise risk management.\n Under our incident response processes’ risk-based escalation protocols, the CISO, or other management, escalates certain incidents to the chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, who may then involve the broader committee or the full Board of Directors, as appropriate.",

We strive to evolve our cyber defenses to help minimize impacts from cyber threats. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a \ncross-functional approach\n. This approach focuses on protecting business operations and preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data by preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats, as well as effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.\n \nOur information security program includes:\n•\nHaving designated information security personnel, led by our Chief Information Security and Fraud Prevention Officer (CISO), who has decades of relevant experience and also serves as Chief Information Officer. The CISO is supported primarily by our Cybersecurity, Compliance, Risk, and Fraud Team (CyberCRAFT), which consists of approximately 500 professionals as of July 31, 2025. In addition to bringing their current expertise to their roles, CyberCRAFT professionals have the ability to participate in our specialized training and development programs to further enhance their cybersecurity skill sets and cross-train on related capabilities. The CISO works closely with the Company’s internal legal team to oversee compliance with legal, regulatory and contractual security requirements;\n•\nRisk assessments designed to help identify and prioritize significant cybersecurity risks. Our process for identifying and assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats includes incorporation of an internally developed threat catalog and our tracking of trends for areas such as vulnerability management, our leverage of technical standards and guidance, input from our participation and collaboration with law enforcement and government initiatives, and our internal and vendor-supported threat intelligence initiatives. The cybersecurity risk assessment operates alongside our broader overall enterprise-wide risk assessment and management process, and key cybersecurity risks are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee in a manner that helps frame cybersecurity risks as part of a broader risk context;\n•\nRegular testing and assessments of our systems and controls to evaluate the information security program maturity and effectiveness using cybersecurity frameworks (such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and SOC 2) and to identify and address potential vulnerabilities—and as appropriate, we adjust our policies, standards, and processes based on testing and assessment results;\n•\nA vulnerability management program to determine the in-scope systems, patch systems based on criticality, and disclose potential vulnerabilities;\n•\nA cybersecurity incident response plan and scenario-specific playbooks for responding to various types of cybersecurity incidents;\n•\nBusiness continuity and disaster recovery plans to support more effective response and recovery efforts in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident or disruption;\n•\nThe use of external service providers and consultants to assess or monitor the environment or otherwise assist with aspects of our cybersecurity controls;\n•\nCommercially available and customized security technologies and security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive data;\n•\nA security awareness and training program for our employees and contractors, with role-based training for certain personnel and positions; and\n•\nA third-party risk management framework\n designed to monitor and address cybersecurity risks from various third parties (including vendors, service providers, and other contractors) that includes diligence regarding the third party’s cybersecurity capabilities and additional monitoring of certain third parties based on the results of diligence. In addition, we have established standard contractual terms and conditions regarding cybersecurity applicable to third parties, as well as further downstream parties, that may be tailored to the use case and sensitivity of any data or business processes involved.\nAdditionally, we maintain cybersecurity insurance which may cover some or all of the potential losses from a cybersecurity incident. During the last fiscal year, we \ndid not\n identify any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that materially affected Intuit, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, we continue to face ongoing and increasing cybersecurity risks which may materially affect us in the \n Intuit\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n29\nTable\n of Contents\nfuture. Additional information on the cybersecurity risks is discussed in “\nRisk Factors”\n in"
