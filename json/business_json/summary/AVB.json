In selecting sites for development or acquisition, we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation, recreation areas, entertainment, shopping and dining . We also seek to generate additional shareholder value from investments in other real estate-related ventures .\n We pursue our development, redevelopment, investment and operating activities with the purpose of \"Creating a Better Way to Live\" We seek to deliver seamless, personalized experiences for our residents on an efficient and effective basis by our resident-focused on-site associates that are supported by our centralized shared services operating organization and flexible technology platform that incorporates automation and artificial intelligence .\n During the three years ended December 31, 2024, we:  acquired 13 apartment communities, excluding unconsolidated investments, and completed the development of 22 apartment communities . We select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development . We maintain regional offices to identify and support development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information .\n In addition to our principal executive office in Arlington, Virginia, we also have regional offices, administrative offices or specialty offices . We usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a long-term conditional contract . Any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income .\n We commit to build infrastructure (such as roads) to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties . Costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services . We may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction ."
