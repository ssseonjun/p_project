These assets are included in our financial assets under management as disclosed in the “Selected key metrics” section of our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Asset Management.”\nAs of September 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, PCG AUA included assets associated with firms affiliated with us through our RCS division of $217.3 billion, $180.7 billion, and $133.3 billion, respectively, of which $188.0 billion, $153.1 billion, and $111.7 billion, respectively, were assets in fee-based accounts.  Based on the nature of the services provided to such firms, revenues related to these assets in the PCG segment are included in “Account and service fees.”  The growth in RCS client assets over time is partially due to transfers into RCS from our other financial advisor channels.  We may continue to experience transfers to our RCS division; however, consistent with our experience in recent fiscal years, we would not expect these financial advisor transfers to significantly impact our results of operations.\nDomestic PCG net new assets \nAs of September 30,\n$ in millions\n2025\n2024\n2023\nDomestic PCG net new assets \n(1) \n$\n52,431\n \n$\n60,709 \n$\n73,254 \nDomestic PCG net new assets growth \n(2)\n3.8\n \n%\n5.5 \n%\n7.7 \n%\n(1)\nDomestic PCG net new assets represents domestic PCG client inflows, including dividends and interest, less domestic PCG client outflows, including commissions, advisory fees, and other fees.  \n(2)\nThe Domestic PCG net new asset growth percentage is based on the beginning Domestic PCG AUA balance for the indicated period. \nPCG AUA and PCG assets in fee-based accounts as of September 30, 2025 increased 11% and 15%, respectively, compared with September 30, 2024, due to market-driven appreciation and net new assets, reflecting the favorable impact of our advisor recruiting and retention.  Offsetting these favorable impacts, domestic PCG net new assets, as well as our PCG AUA and assets in fee-based accounts, were negatively impacted by the departure of primarily one large branch in our independent contractor division in our first fiscal quarter of 2025.  PCG fee-based assets increased 7% from June 30, 2025 to September 30, 2025, which will favorably impact asset management and related administrative fees for our fiscal first quarter of 2026 results.  PCG assets in fee-based accounts continued to be a significant percentage of overall PCG AUA due to many clients’ preference for fee-based alternatives versus transaction-based accounts and, as a result, a significant portion of our PCG revenues is directly impacted by market movements. \nFee-based accounts within our PCG segment are comprised of a wide array of products and programs that we offer our clients.  The majority of assets in fee-based accounts within our PCG segment are invested in programs for which our financial advisors provide investment advisory services, either on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis.  Administrative services for such accounts (e.g., record-keeping) are generally performed by our Asset Management segment and, as a result, a portion of the related revenue is shared with the Asset Management segment.\nWe also offer our clients fee-based accounts that are invested in “Managed programs” overseen by AMS, which is part of our Asset Management segment.  Fee-billable assets invested in managed programs are included in both “Assets in fee-based accounts” in the preceding table and “Financial assets under management” in the Asset Management segment.  Revenues related to managed programs are shared by our PCG and Asset Management segments.  The Asset Management segment receives a higher portion of the revenues related to accounts invested in managed programs, as compared to the portion received for non-managed programs, as it is performing portfolio management services in addition to administrative services.  \n52\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nThe vast majority of the revenues we earn from fee-based accounts are recorded in “Asset management and related administrative fees” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  Fees received from such accounts are based on the value of client assets in fee-based accounts and vary based on the specific account types in which the client invests and the level of assets in the client relationship.  As fees for the majority of such accounts are billed based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter, revenues from fee-based accounts may not be immediately affected by changes in asset values, but rather the impacts are seen in the following quarter.\nFinancial advisors\nAs of September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2023\nEmployees\n3,878\n \n3,826 \n3,693 \nIndependent contractors \n5,065\n \n4,961 \n5,019 \nTotal advisors\n8,943\n \n8,787 \n8,712 \nThe number of financial advisors as of September 30, 2025 increased compared to the prior year, as new recruits and trainees that were moved into production roles exceeded departures and planned retirements.  Generally, with planned retirements, assets are retained at the firm pursuant to advisor succession plans.  Advisors in our RCS division are not included in our financial advisor metric although their client assets are included in PCG AUA.  \nClients’ domestic cash sweep balances and ESP balances\nAs of September 30,\n$ in millions\n2025\n2024\n2023\nRJBDP:\nBank segment\n$\n26,555\n \n$\n23,978 \n$\n25,355 \nThird-party banks\n14,761\n \n18,226 \n15,858 \nSubtotal RJBDP\n41,316\n \n42,204 \n41,213 \nCIP\n1,572\n \n1,653 \n1,620 \nTotal clients’ domestic cash sweep balances\n42,888\n \n43,857 \n42,833 \nESP \n13,465\n \n14,018 \n13,592 \nTotal clients’ domestic cash sweep and ESP balances\n$\n56,353\n \n$\n57,875 \n$\n56,425 \n \nYear ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2023\nAverage yield on RJBDP - third-party banks\n3.01\n \n%\n3.50 \n%\n3.20 \n%\nA portion of our domestic clients’ cash is included in the RJBDP, a multi-bank sweep program in which clients’ cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are swept into interest-bearing deposit accounts at either of our bank subsidiaries, which are included in our Bank segment, or various third-party banks.  Balances swept to third-party banks are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  Our PCG segment earns servicing fees for the administrative services we provide related to our clients’ deposits that are swept to banks as part of the RJBDP.  These servicing fees are variable in nature and fluctuate based on client cash balances in the program, as well as the level of short-term interest rates and the interest paid to clients on balances in the RJBDP.  Under our intersegment policies, the PCG segment receives from our Bank segment the greater of a base servicing fee or a net yield equivalent to the average yield that the firm would otherwise receive from third-party banks in the RJBDP.  In the current interest rate environment the PCG segment RJBDP fee revenues are derived from the yield from third-party banks in the program and the Bank segment RJBDP servicing costs reflect such market rate for the deposits.  The fees that the PCG segment earns from the Bank segment, as well as the servicing costs incurred on the deposits in the Bank segment, are eliminated in consolidation.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Net interest analysis” of this Form 10-K for further information regarding factors impacting the servicing fees we receive related to the RJBDP, as well as the interest paid to clients on their cash balances. \n53\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nThe “Average yield on RJBDP - third-party banks” in the preceding table is computed by dividing RJBDP fees from third-party banks, which are net of the interest expense paid to clients by the third-party banks, by the average daily RJBDP balances at third-party banks.  The average yield on RJBDP - third-party banks for the year ended September 30, 2025 decreased from the prior year largely as a result of the decreases in the Fed’s short-term benchmark interest rate and, to a lesser extent, the impact of growth in RJBDP balances offering enhanced rates to clients which reduced the yield earned from third-party banks on such balances.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Net interest analysis” of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nTotal clients’ domestic cash sweep and ESP balances decreased 3% compared with September 30, 2024, with decreases in both RJBDP balances and the ESP.  PCG segment results can be impacted by not only changes in the level of client cash balances, but also by the allocation of client cash balances between the RJBDP, the CIP, and the ESP, as the PCG segment may earn different amounts from each of these client cash destinations, depending on multiple factors.\nYear ended September 30, 2025 compared with the year ended September 30, 2024\nNet revenues of $10.18 billion increased 8% while pre-tax income of $1.72 billion decreased 4%.  \nAsset management and related administrative fees increased $734 million, or 14%, primarily due to higher assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of each of the current-year quarterly billing periods compared with the prior-year billing periods resulting from market-driven appreciation and net new assets, due to the favorable impact of our advisor recruiting and retention.\nBrokerage revenues increased $106 million, or 6%, primarily due to higher client activity in the current year.\nAccount and service fees decreased $123 million, or 6%, primarily due to a decrease in RJBDP fees largely resulting from a decrease in the average RJBDP third-party bank yield.  RJBDP fees from third-party banks decreased by a greater amount than RJBDP fees from our Bank segment as average balances swept to third-party banks declined due to a higher allocation of balances swept to our Bank segment, which increased compared to the prior year.  Partially offsetting the decline in total RJBDP fees, mutual fund service fees increased primarily due to higher average mutual fund assets.\nCompensation-related expenses increased $684 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher commission expense resulting from higher compensable revenues, including asset management and related administrative fees and brokerage revenues, as well as an increase in compensation costs to support our growth, including higher financial advisor recruiting-related expenses, and annual salary increases.\nNon-compensation expenses increased $104 million, or 11%, compared with the prior year primarily due to higher expenses to support our growth, including investments in technology and financial advisor recruiting activities.  In addition, the current year included higher expenses related to legal and regulatory matters as the prior year reflected a net reserve release which did not reoccur in the current year.\nYear ended September 30, 2024 compared with the year ended September 30, 2023\nRefer to “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of our fiscal 2024 results compared to fiscal 2023.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – CAPITAL MARKETS\nOur Capital Markets segment conducts investment banking, institutional sales and trading of financial instruments, equity research, and the syndication and management of investments in low-income housing funds and funds of a similar nature, the majority of which qualify for tax credits.\nWe provide various investment banking services, including merger & acquisition advisory, and other advisory services, underwriting and placement of public and private equity and debt securities for corporate clients, private capital fundraising, and public financing activities.  Revenues from investment banking activities are driven principally by our role in the transaction and the number and sizes of the transactions in which we are involved.\nWe earn brokerage revenues for the sale of both equity and fixed income products to institutional clients, as well as from our market-making activities in fixed income debt instruments.  Client activity is influenced by a combination of general market \n54\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nactivity and our Capital Markets group’s ability to find attractive investment opportunities for clients.  In certain cases, we transact on a principal basis, which involves the purchase of financial instruments from, and the sale of financial instruments to, our clients as well as other dealers who may be purchasing or selling financial instruments for their own account or acting on behalf of their clients.  Profits and losses related to this activity are primarily derived from the spreads between bid and ask prices, as well as market trends for the individual securities during the period we hold them.  To facilitate such transactions, we carry inventories of financial instruments.  In our fixed income businesses, we also enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts to facilitate client transactions or to actively manage risk exposures.\nFor an overview of our Capital Markets segment operations, refer to the information presented in “Item 1 - Business” of this Form 10-K.\nOperating results\n \nYear ended September 30,\n% change\n$ in millions\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2025 vs. 2024\n2024 vs. 2023\nRevenues:\n \n \n \nBrokerage revenues:\n \n \n \nFixed income\n$\n397\n \n$\n367 \n$\n345 \n8 \n%\n6 \n%\nEquity\n168\n \n143 \n130 \n17 \n%\n10 \n%\nTotal brokerage revenues\n565\n \n510 \n475 \n11 \n%\n7 \n%\nInvestment banking:\nMerger & acquisition and advisory\n623\n \n521 \n418 \n20 \n%\n25 \n%\nEquity underwriting\n150\n \n131 \n85 \n15 \n%\n54 \n%\nDebt underwriting\n263\n \n168 \n110 \n57 \n%\n53 \n%\nTotal investment banking\n1,036\n \n820 \n613 \n26 \n%\n34 \n%\nInterest income\n111\n \n109 \n88 \n2 \n%\n24 \n%\nAffordable housing investments business revenues\n140\n \n118 \n109 \n19 \n%\n8 \n%\nAll other\n17\n \n18 \n14 \n(6)\n%\n29 \n%\nTotal revenues\n1,869\n \n1,575 \n1,299 \n19 \n%\n21 \n%\nInterest expense\n(99)\n(103)\n(85)\n(4)\n%\n21 \n%\nNet revenues\n1,770\n \n1,472 \n1,214 \n20 \n%\n21 \n%\nNon-interest expenses:\n \n \n \nCompensation, commissions and benefits\n1,128\n \n1,002 \n902 \n13 \n%\n11 \n%\nNon-compensation expense\n496 \n403 \n403 \n23 \n%\n— \n%\nTotal non-interest expenses\n1,624\n \n1,405 \n1,305 \n16 \n%\n8 \n%\nPre-tax income/(loss)\n$\n146\n \n$\n67 \n$\n(91)\n118 \n%\nNM\nYear ended September 30, 2025 compared with the year ended September 30, 2024\nNet revenues of $1.77 billion increased 20% and pre-tax income of $146 million increased 118%.\nInvestment banking revenues increased $216 million, or 26%, primarily due to more favorable market conditions and larger transactions closed during the current year.  \nBrokerage revenues increased $55 million, or 11%, primarily due to an increase in both fixed income and equity securities as client activity levels increased in the current year.\nCompensation-related expenses increased $126 million, or 13%, primarily due to the increase in revenues. \nNon-compensation expenses increased $93 million, or 23%, primarily due to the aforementioned $58 million reserve increase in the current year associated with the settlement of a legal matter, and higher expenses to support our growth.\nYear ended September 30, 2024 compared with the year ended September 30, 2023\nRefer to “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of our fiscal 2024 results compared to fiscal 2023.\n55\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – ASSET MANAGEMENT\nOur Asset Management segment earns asset management and related administrative fees for providing asset management, portfolio management and related administrative services to retail and institutional clients.  This segment oversees the portion of our fee-based AUA invested in “managed programs” for our PCG clients through AMS.  This segment also provides asset management services through Raymond James Investment Management for certain retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts, and proprietary mutual funds that we manage, generally using active portfolio management strategies.  Asset management fees are based on fee-billable assets under management, which are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets.  Rising equity markets have historically had a positive impact on revenues as existing accounts increase in value.  Conversely, declining markets typically have a negative impact on revenue levels.\nOur Asset Management segment also earns administrative fees on certain fee-based assets within PCG that are not overseen by our Asset Management segment, but for which the segment provides administrative support (e.g., record-keeping).  These administrative fees are based on asset balances, which are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets.  \nOur Asset Management segment also earns asset management and related administrative fees through services provided by RJ Trust and RJTCNH.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – BANK\nThe Bank segment provides various types of loans, including SBL, corporate loans, residential mortgage loans, and tax-exempt loans.  Our Bank segment is active in corporate loan syndications and participations and lending directly to clients.  We also provide FDIC-insured deposit accounts, including to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as other retail and corporate deposit and liquidity management products and services.  Our Bank segment generates net interest income principally through the interest income earned on loans and an investment portfolio of available-for-sale securities, which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings.  Our Bank segment’s net interest income is affected by the levels of interest rates, interest-earning assets, and interest-bearing liabilities.  Depending upon interest costs incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, higher interest-earning asset balances and higher interest rates generally lead to increased net interest income, and conversely, decreases in short-term interest rates generally lead to lower net interest income.  For additional information on average interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability balances and the related interest income and expense, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Net interest analysis” of this Form 10-K.

The Bank segment net interest margin increased slightly to 2.68% from 2.67% for the prior year.\nThe bank loan provision for credit losses was $37 million for the current year, a decrease of $8 million compared with $45 million for the prior year.  The bank loan provision for credit losses for the current year primarily reflected the impacts of loan downgrades, charge-offs, and specific reserves on certain loans, partially offset by the favorable impacts of an improved economic forecast and reserve releases related to certain loan sales and paydowns.  The bank loan provision for credit losses for the prior year primarily reflected the impacts of loan growth, specific reserves, loan downgrades, and charge-offs in our C&I and CRE loan portfolios, partially offset by the favorable impacts of an improved economic forecast, loan repayments, and loan sales in the C&I loan portfolio.\nNon-compensation expenses, excluding the bank loan provision for credit losses, decreased $47 million, or 4%, primarily due to a decrease of $70 million, or 8%, in RJBDP fees paid to PCG, partially offset by higher expenses related to our growth.  The Bank segment RJBDP fees paid to PCG and related revenues earned by the PCG segment are eliminated in consolidation.  \n59\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS\nThe assets on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents, assets segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash (primarily segregated for the benefit of clients), receivables including bank loans, financial instruments held either for trading purposes or as investments, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, and other assets.  A significant portion of our assets were liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business. \nTotal assets of $88.23 billion as of September 30, 2025 were $5.24 billion, or 6%, higher than our total assets as of September 30, 2024.  Bank loans, net increased $5.57 billion primarily driven by increases in SBL, residential mortgage loans, and C&I loans.  Cash and cash equivalents increased $391 million (see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash flows for more information).  Loans to financial advisors, net also increased $300 million due to our recruiting activities.  These increases were partially offset by a $1.37 billion decrease in available-for-sale securities primarily driven by net maturities.\nAs of September 30, 2025, our total liabilities of $75.73 billion were $4.40 billion, or 6%, higher than our total liabilities as of September 30, 2024.  This increase was largely driven by a $2.89 billion increase in bank deposits and a $1.48 billion increase in senior notes payable due to the $1.5 billion issuance of senior notes in September 2025.  Accrued compensation, commissions, and benefits also increased $278 million.  These increases were partially offset by a $349 million decrease in other borrowings due to the redemption of our subordinated notes, as well as the maturity and repayment of certain FHLB borrowings.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity and capital are essential to our business.  Liquidity risk is the risk that the firm will be unable to meet expected or unexpected cash flow requirements, such as payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit, and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support its businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions.  \nThe primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding and liquidity to conduct our business over a range of economic and market environments, including times of broader industry or market liquidity stress events.  In times of market stress or uncertainty, we generally maintain higher levels of liquidity to ensure we have adequate funding to support our businesses and meet our clients’ needs.  We seek to manage capital levels to support execution of our business strategy, provide financial strength to our subsidiaries, and maintain sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and conservative internal management targets.\nLiquidity and capital resources are provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities.  Our businesses generate substantially all of their own liquidity and funding needs.  We have a contingency funding plan which would guide our actions if one or more of our businesses were to experience disruptions from normal funding and liquidity sources.  These actions include reallocating client cash balances in the RJBDP from third-party banks to our bank subsidiaries thereby bringing those deposits onto our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, increasing our FHLB borrowings or borrowing from the Federal Reserve’s discount window at our bank subsidiaries, accessing committed and uncommitted lines of credit at the parent or certain operating subsidiaries, or accessing capital markets.  \nWe also have the ability to create additional sources of funding by developing new products to meet the financial needs of our clients, such as the ESP deposit offering and, from time to time, offering enhanced rates on certain RJBDP deposits.  With each of our deposit offerings, we work to obtain sufficient liquidity to support our business operations while also maintaining a high level of FDIC insurance coverage for our clients.  \nOur financing activities could also include bank borrowings, collateralized financing arrangements, or additional capital raising activities under our “universal” shelf registration statement.  We believe our existing assets, most of which can be readily monetized, together with funds generated from operations and available from committed and uncommitted financing facilities, provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity in the short-term.  We also believe that we will be able to continue to meet our long-term funding and liquidity requirements due to our strong financial position and ability to access capital from financial markets. \n61\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nLiquidity and capital management\nSenior management establishes our liquidity and capital management frameworks.  Our liquidity and capital management frameworks are overseen by our Asset and Liability Committee, a senior management committee that develops and executes strategies and policies to manage our liquidity risk and interest rate risk, as well as provides oversight over the firm’s investments.  Our liquidity management framework is designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of funding, even when funding markets experience stress.  We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across products and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets (e.g., the maturities of our available-for-sale securities portfolio).  The liquidity management framework includes senior management’s review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries.  Our decisions on the allocation of resources to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability, cash flow, risk, future liquidity needs, and required capital levels.  Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring, and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition and liquidity, and also maintains our relationships with various lenders.  The objective of our liquidity management framework is to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient funding and liquidity.   \nOur capital planning and capital risk management processes are governed by the Capital Planning Committee (“CPC”), a senior management committee that provides oversight on our capital planning and ensures that our strategic planning and risk management processes are integrated into the capital planning process.  The CPC meets at least quarterly to review key metrics related to the firm’s capital, such as debt structure and capital ratios; to analyze potential and emerging risks to capital; to oversee our annual firmwide capital stress test; and to propose capital actions to the Board of Directors, such as declaring dividends, repurchasing securities, and raising capital.  To ensure that we have sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses, the firm adheres to capital risk appetite statements and tolerances set in excess of regulatory minimums, which are established by the CPC and approved by the Board of Directors.  We conduct enterprise-wide capital stress testing to ensure that we maintain adequate capital to adhere to our established tolerances under multiple scenarios, including a stressed scenario. \nCapital structure\nCommon equity (i.e., common stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings) is the primary component of our capital structure.  Common equity allows for the absorption of losses on an ongoing basis and for the conservation of resources during stress periods, as we have discretion on the amount and timing of dividends and other capital actions.  Information about our common equity is included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nUnder regulatory capital rules applicable to us as a bank holding company that has made an election to be a financial holding company, we are required to maintain minimum leverage ratios (defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets), as well as minimum ratios of tier 1 capital, common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, and total capital to risk-weighted assets.  These capital ratios incorporate quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under the regulatory capital rules and are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings, and other factors.  We calculate these ratios in order to assess compliance with both regulatory requirements and internal capital policies.  In order to maintain our ability to take certain capital actions, including dividends and common equity repurchases, and to make bonus payments, we must hold a capital conservation buffer above our minimum risk-based capital requirements.  See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information about our regulatory capital and related capital ratios.  \nWe have classified all of our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and have not classified any of our investments in debt securities as held-to-maturity.  Accordingly, we account for our available-for-sale securities at fair value at each reporting date, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in AOCI.  Current Basel III rules permit us to make an election to exclude most components of AOCI when calculating CET1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital.  We have elected the AOCI opt-out for regulatory capital purposes and therefore exclude certain elements of AOCI, including gains/losses on our available-for-sale portfolio, from our capital calculations.\n62\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nCash flows\nCash and cash equivalents (excluding amounts segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash) of $11.39 billion at September 30, 2025 increased $391 million compared with September 30, 2024.  The increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily resulted from an increase in bank deposits, net income, proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior notes, and net maturities of available-for-sale securities during the year. These increases were partially offset by net investments in bank loans, common stock repurchases, dividends paid on our common and preferred stock, net loans provided to financial advisors, and the repayment of certain FHLB borrowings and our subordinated notes during the year.\nSources of liquidity\nRJF corporate cash of $3.67 billion as of September 30, 2025, included cash and cash equivalents held directly at the parent company as well as cash loaned by the parent company to RJ&A.  As of September 30, 2025, RJF had loaned $1.40 billion to RJ&A (such amount is included in the RJ&A cash balance in the following table), which RJ&A has invested on behalf of RJF in cash and cash equivalents or otherwise deployed in its normal business activities.\nThe following table presents our holdings of cash and cash equivalents.\n$ in millions\nSeptember 30, 2025\nRJF\n$\n2,296 \nTriState Capital Bank\n3,112 \nRJ&A\n2,654 \nRaymond James Bank\n1,851 \nRJ Ltd.\n516 \nRaymond James Trust Company of New Hampshire\n135 \nRaymond James Capital Services, LLC\n132 \nRaymond James Wealth Management Limited \n(1)\n131 \nRaymond James Financial Services, Inc.\n116 \nRaymond James Investment Management\n109 \nOther subsidiaries\n337 \nTotal cash and cash equivalents\n$\n11,389\n \n(1)\nEffective July 1, 2025, Charles Stanley & Co. Limited changed its legal name to Raymond James Wealth Management Limited (“RJWM”). \nRJF maintained depository accounts at Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank totaling $302 million as of September 30, 2025.  The portion of this total that was available on demand without restrictions, which amounted to $270 million as of September 30, 2025, is reflected in the RJF cash balance and excluded from Raymond James Bank’s cash balance in the preceding table.\nA large portion of the cash and cash equivalents balances at our non-U.S. subsidiaries, including RJ Ltd. and RJWM, was held to meet regulatory requirements and was not available for use by the parent as of September 30, 2025.\nIn addition to the cash balances described, we have various other potential sources of cash available to the parent company from subsidiaries, as described in the following section.\nLiquidity available from subsidiaries\nLiquidity is principally available to RJF from RJ&A and Raymond James Bank.\nCertain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  As a member firm of FINRA, RJ&A is subject to FINRA’s capital requirements, which are substantially the same as Rule 15c3-1.  Rule 15c3-1 provides for an “alternative net capital requirement,” which RJ&A has elected.  Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $1.5 million or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client balances.  In addition, covenants in RJ&A’s committed financing arrangements require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit items.  At September 30, 2025, RJ&A significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements, the covenants in its financing arrangements pertaining to net capital, as well as its internally-targeted net capital tolerances.  FINRA may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements which may result in RJ&A \n64\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nlimiting dividends it would otherwise remit to RJF.  We evaluate regulatory requirements, loan covenants and certain internal tolerances when determining the amount of liquidity available to RJF from RJ&A.\nOur bank subsidiaries may pay dividends to RJF without prior approval of their regulators as long as the dividends do not exceed the sum of their current calendar year and the previous two calendar years’ retained net income, and they maintain their targeted regulatory capital ratios, among other restrictions.  Dividends paid to RJF from our bank subsidiaries may be limited to the extent that capital is needed to support balance sheet growth or as part of our liquidity and capital management activities.  \nIf necessary, RJF can also access additional liquidity, largely without regulatory preapproval, from certain other subsidiaries that generally do not serve as regular sources of dividend distributions to the parent.\nBorrowings and financing arrangements\nFinancing arrangements\nWe have various financing arrangements in place with third-party lenders that allow us the flexibility to borrow funds on a secured or unsecured basis to meet our liquidity needs.  We generally utilize these financing arrangements to finance a portion of our fixed income trading instruments held by RJ&A or for cash management purposes.  Our ability to borrow under these arrangements is dependent upon compliance with the conditions in our various loan agreements and, in the case of secured borrowings, collateral eligibility requirements.\nIn September 2025, we amended our revolving credit facility agreement, a committed unsecured line of credit under which both RJ&A and RJF have the ability to borrow.  The amended agreement extended the term to September 2030, increased the borrowing capacity to $1 billion, and decreased the applicable rate by which interest is calculated, generally resulting in a decrease of 12.5 basis points across all borrowing scenarios.  We had no such borrowings outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2025.  See our discussion of the Credit Facility in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition to our Credit Facility, we have various uncommitted financing arrangements with third-party lenders, which are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit.  Our uncommitted secured financing arrangements generally require us to post collateral in excess of the amount borrowed and are generally collateralized by RJ&A-owned securities or by securities that we have received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements (i.e., securities purchased under agreements to resell).  As of September 30, 2025, we had outstanding borrowings under three uncommitted secured borrowing arrangements out of a total of 14 uncommitted financing arrangements (nine uncommitted secured and five uncommitted unsecured).  However, lenders are generally under no contractual obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities.  See Notes 6 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these borrowings.\nOur borrowings on uncommitted secured financing arrangements, which were in the form of repurchase agreements in RJ&A, were included in “Collateralized financings” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  The average daily balance outstanding during the five most recent quarters, the maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter and the period-end balances for repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are detailed in the following table.\n \nRepurchase transactions\nReverse repurchase transactions\nFor the quarter ended:\n($ in millions)\nAverage daily \nbalance \noutstanding\nMaximum month-end \nbalance outstanding \nduring the quarter\nEnd of period \nbalance \noutstanding\nAverage daily \nbalance \noutstanding\nMaximum month-end \nbalance outstanding \nduring the quarter\nEnd of period \nbalance \noutstanding\nSeptember 30, 2025\n$\n280\n \n$\n325\n \n$\n325\n \n$\n261\n \n$\n302\n \n$\n302\n \nJune 30, 2025\n$\n273 \n$\n315 \n$\n228 \n$\n211 \n$\n210 \n$\n210 \nMarch 31, 2025\n$\n273 \n$\n299 \n$\n205 \n$\n268 \n$\n305 \n$\n215 \nDecember 31, 2024\n$\n344 \n$\n345 \n$\n307 \n$\n318 \n$\n330 \n$\n267 \nSeptember 30, 2024\n$\n344 \n$\n402 \n$\n402 \n$\n337 \n$\n413 \n$\n413 \n65\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nOther borrowings and collateralized financings\nWe had $700 million in FHLB borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2025, comprised of floating-rate and fixed-rate advances.  The interest rates on our floating-rate advances are based on SOFR.  We use interest rate swaps to manage the risk of increases in interest rates associated with our floating-rate FHLB advances by converting the balances subject to variable interest rates to a fixed interest rate.\nWe pledge certain of our bank loans and available-for-sale securities with the FHLB as security for both the repayment of certain borrowings and to secure capacity for additional borrowings as needed.  As of September 30, 2025, we had $9.6 billion in immediate credit available from the FHLB based on the collateral pledged.  See Notes 6 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding bank loans and available-for-sale securities pledged with the FHLB and for additional information on our FHLB borrowings, including the related maturities and interest rates.\nAs member banks, our bank subsidiaries have access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window and may have access to other lending programs that may be established by the Federal Reserve in unusual and exigent circumstances.  As of September 30, 2025, our bank subsidiaries had pledged certain bank loans with the Federal Reserve and had $15.1 billion in immediate credit available from the FRB based on collateral pledged.  See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our assets pledged with the FRB.\nA portion of our fixed income transactions are cleared through a third-party clearing organization, which provides financing for the purchase of trading instruments to support such transactions.  The amount of financing is based on the amount of trading inventory financed, as well as any deposits held at the clearing organization.  Amounts outstanding under this financing arrangement are collateralized by a portion of our trading inventory and accrue interest based on market rates.  While we had borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2025, the clearing organization is under no contractual obligation to lend to us under this arrangement.\nOn August 15, 2025, we redeemed all subordinated notes, pursuant to the applicable indenture provisions.  The subordinated notes were redeemed at their principal amount of $98 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing cash on hand.  See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these borrowings. \nWe may act as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one counterparty and then lend them to another counterparty. Where permitted, we have also loaned securities owned by clients or the firm to broker-dealers and other financial institutions.  We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balance of $786 million as of September 30, 2025 related to the securities loaned included in “Collateralized financings” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition of this Form 10-K.  See Notes 2 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information on our collateralized agreements and financings.\nSenior notes payable\nOn September 11, 2025, to secure financing during a period of favorable market conditions characterized by tight credit spreads and attractive benchmark yields, we issued $1.5 billion in senior notes, consisting of $650 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.90% senior notes due September 2035 and $850 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.65% senior notes due September 2055 in a registered underwritten public offering.  As of September 30, 2025, after the issuance of the aforementioned notes, we had aggregate outstanding senior notes payable of $3.52 billion, which, exclusive of any unaccreted premiums or discounts and debt issuance costs, was comprised of $500 million par 4.65% senior notes due April 2030,  $650 million par 4.90% senior notes due September 2035, $800 million par 4.95% senior notes due July 2046, $750 million par 3.75% senior notes due April 2051, and $850 million par 5.65% senior notes due September 2055.  At September 30, 2025, estimated future contractual interest payments on our senior notes were approximately $3.44 billion, of which $171 million is payable in fiscal 2026, with the remainder extending through fiscal 2055.  See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information on our senior notes payable.\n66\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nCredit ratings\nOur issuer, senior long-term debt, and preferred stock credit ratings as of the most current report are detailed in the following table.  In connection with our 2025 senior notes issuance, the rating agencies affirmed our current credit ratings for the newly issued debt.  \nCredit Rating \nFitch Ratings, Inc.\nMoody’s\nStandard & Poor’s Ratings Services\nIssuer and senior long-term debt:\nRating\nA-\nA3\nA-\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nLast rating action\nAffirmed\nAffirmed\nAffirmed\nDate of last rating action\nApril 2025\nMarch 2025\nFebruary 2025\nPreferred stock:\nRating\nBB+\nBaa3 (hyb)\nNot rated\nLast rating action\nAffirmed\nAffirmed\nN/A\nDate of last rating action\nApril 2025\nMarch 2025\nN/A\n \nOur current credit ratings depend upon a number of factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, capital structure, overall risk management, business diversification and market share, and competitive position in the markets in which we operate.  Deterioration in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings.  Any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to obtain additional financing.\nShould our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering, it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond investors.  A downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable.  A downgrade below investment grade could result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions.  A credit downgrade could damage our reputation and result in certain counterparties limiting their business with us, result in negative comments by analysts, potentially negatively impact investors’ and/or clients’ perception of us, cause clients to withdraw bank deposits that exceed FDIC insurance limits from our bank subsidiaries, and cause a decline in our stock price.  None of our borrowing arrangements contains a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings.  However, a credit downgrade would result in the firm incurring a higher facility fee on the Credit Facility, in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on that line as of and subsequent to such downgrade.  Conversely, an improvement in RJF’s current credit rating could have a favorable impact on the facility fee, as well as the interest rate applicable to any borrowings on such line.\nOther sources and uses of liquidity\nWe have corporate-owned life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans.  Certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans are employee-directed (i.e., the participant chooses investment portfolio benchmarks) while others are company-directed.  Of the corporate-owned life insurance policies which fund these plans, certain policies could be used as a source of liquidity for the firm.  Those policies against which we could readily borrow had a cash surrender value of $1.35 billion as of September 30, 2025, comprised of $939 million related to employee-directed plans and $410 million related to company-directed plans, and we were able to borrow up to 90%, or $1.21 billion, of the September 30, 2025 total without restriction.  To effect any such borrowing, the underlying investments would be converted to money market investments, therefore requiring us to take market risk related to the employee-directed plans.  There were no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of September 30, 2025.\nOn May 8, 2024, we filed a “universal” shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we can issue debt, equity and other capital instruments if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune.  Subject to certain conditions, this registration statement will be effective through May 8, 2027.\n67\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nWe purchase our own common stock from time to time in conjunction with a number of activities, which are described in further detail in Note 19 and “Part II - Item 5 - Market for registrant’s common equity, related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” of this Form 10-K.  In periods where our capital and liquidity position are strong, and subject to our Board of Directors’ common stock repurchase authorization limit, we may purchase higher quantities of our shares on a more consistent basis than we have historically as part of our capital deployment strategies.\nOn October 14, 2025, we announced we had reached an agreement to acquire a majority stake in GreensLedge Holdings LLC (“GreensLedge”), a boutique investment bank specializing in structured credit and securitization.  The transaction, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, is currently expected to close in our fiscal 2026.  The acquisition of GreensLedge will add securitization and advisory capabilities to our existing fixed income operations.  We currently have the ability to utilize our cash on hand to fund the acquisition.  GreensLedge will operate within our Capital Markets segment upon completion of the acquisition.  \nAs part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments, including certificates of deposit, lease obligations and other contractual arrangements, such as for software licenses and various services.  See Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information regarding our lease obligations and certificates of deposit, respectively.  We have entered into investment commitments, lending commitments, and other commitments to extend credit for which we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of future payments.  See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information.\nREGULATORY\nRefer to the discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the impact on our operations of certain rules and regulations in “Item 1 - Business - Regulation” of this Form 10-K.\nRJF and many of its subsidiaries are each subject to various regulatory capital requirements.  As of September 30, 2025, all of our active regulated domestic and international subsidiaries had net capital in excess of minimum requirements.  In addition, RJF, Raymond James Bank, and TriState Capital Bank were categorized as “well-capitalized” as of September 30, 2025.  The maintenance of certain risk-based and other regulatory capital levels could influence various capital allocation decisions impacting one or more of our businesses.  However, due to the current capital position of RJF and its regulated subsidiaries, we do not anticipate these capital requirements will have a negative impact on our future business activities.  See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information on regulatory capital requirements.\nRJF and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regular reviews and inspections by regulatory authorities and SROs.  In addition, regulatory agencies and SROs institute investigations from time to time into industry practices, among other things.  For example, beginning in August 2024, the SEC’s Division of Enforcement requested information regarding our practices related to cash sweep programs for investment advisory clients and is reportedly conducting similar reviews at other financial institutions.  The firm has been cooperating with this inquiry.  In addition, in August 2024 and December 2024, a total of three putative class action lawsuits were filed in federal district court alleging, among other things, that the firm breached its fiduciary duties or agreements with regard to rates paid to clients in our cash sweep programs.  All three cases were subsequently consolidated, but on July 24, 2025, the plaintiff in one of the three lawsuits voluntarily dismissed all of their claims without prejudice.  We intend to vigorously defend against the claims asserted by the remaining named plaintiffs.\nThe SEC adopted final rules mandating central clearing of cash, repurchase, and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasuries.  In February 2025, the SEC extended the compliance dates for these rules by one year to December 2026 for cash market transactions and to June 2027 for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions.  We are actively working to update our business practices to align with the new requirements and do not expect the rule to have a material impact on our financial position.\nIn December 2024, the SEC adopted a final rule amending SEC Rules 15c3-3, the Customer Protection rule, and 15c3-1, the Net Capital rule.  These amendments will require large clearing/carrying broker-dealers, including RJ&A, to compute customer and Proprietary Account of Broker-dealer reserve requirements and make any required reserve account deposits daily rather than the current weekly requirement.  In June 2025, the SEC extended the compliance date for this rule by six months to June\n \n30, 2026.  We are prepared to comply with the rule as of its effective date and do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position.\n68\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, enacting significant changes to the U.S. tax code.  Among its many provisions, those with the largest impact on our firm include the restoration of accelerated depreciation provisions (i.e., bonus depreciation), immediate expensing for domestic research and development costs (reversing prior amortization requirements), modifications to certain U.S. international tax provisions enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a new limitation on charitable contributions whereby deductions will only be permitted for amounts exceeding 1% of taxable income, and the eventual phaseout of certain renewable energy tax credit programs.  The changes to renewable energy programs do not impact tax credits applicable to our existing renewable energy equity investments. The accelerated depreciation provisions were effective for the year ended September 30, 2025 and did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or effective income tax rate.  We do not expect the remaining provisions, which have varying effective dates, to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nIn August 2023, Raymond James Investment Services Limited, one of our U.K. subsidiaries, agreed to a Voluntary Application for Imposition of Requirements (“VREQ”) with the FCA that prohibits the onboarding of new branches or financial advisors without the prior consent of the FCA.  This VREQ has not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the future.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period.  Management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period.  For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.\nDue to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information.  Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  Therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position.  We believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions, those described in the following sections involve a high degree of judgment and complexity.\nLoss provisions\nAllowance for credit losses\nWe evaluate certain of our financial assets, including bank loans, to estimate an allowance for credit losses based on expected credit losses over a financial asset’s lifetime.  The remaining life of our financial assets is determined by considering contractual terms and expected prepayments, among other factors.  We use multiple methodologies in estimating an allowance for credit losses and our approaches differ by type of financial asset and the risk characteristics within each financial asset type.  Our estimates are based on ongoing evaluations of our financial assets, the related credit risk characteristics, and the overall economic and environmental conditions affecting the financial assets.  Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors requiring significant management judgment due to matters that are inherently uncertain.  This uncertainty can produce volatility in our allowance for credit losses.  In addition, the allowance for credit losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses.  In such an event, any losses in excess of our allowance would result in a decrease in our net income, as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital.\nWe generally estimate the allowance for credit losses on bank loans using credit risk models which incorporate relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and, most notably, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.  After testing the reasonableness of a variety of economic forecast scenarios, each model is run using a single forecast scenario selected for each model.  Our forecasts incorporate assumptions related to macroeconomic indicators including, but not limited to, U.S. gross domestic product, equity market indices, unemployment rates, and commercial real estate and residential home price indices.  \nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates on our bank loan portfolio to macroeconomic forecasts, we compared our modeled estimates under the base case economic scenario used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2025 to what our estimate would have been under a downside case scenario and an upside case scenario, without considering any offsetting effects in the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses.  As of September 30, 2025, use of the downside case scenario would have resulted in an increase of approximately $170 million in the quantitative portion of our allowance for credit losses on bank loans, while the use of the upside case scenario would have resulted in a reduction of \n69\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\napproximately $25 million in the quantitative portion of our allowance for credit losses on bank loans.  These hypothetical outcomes reflect the relative sensitivity of the modeled portion of our allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecasted scenarios but do not consider any potential impact qualitative adjustments could have on the allowance for credit losses in such environments.  Qualitative adjustments could either increase or decrease modeled loss estimates calculated using an alternative economic scenario assumption.  Further, such sensitivity calculations do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the related allowance for a number of reasons including: (1) management’s predictions of future economic trends and relationships among the scenarios may differ from actual events; and (2) management’s application of subjective measures to modeled results through the qualitative portion of the allowance for credit losses when appropriate.  The downside case scenario utilized in this hypothetical sensitivity analysis assumes a moderate recession.  To the extent macroeconomic conditions worsen beyond those assumed in this downside case scenario, we could incur provisions for credit losses significantly in excess of those estimated in this analysis. \nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information regarding our allowance for credit losses related to bank loans as of September 30, 2025.\nLoss provisions for legal and regulatory matters\nThe recorded amount of liabilities related to legal and regulatory matters is subject to significant management judgment.  For a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing such accruals, see the “Contingent liabilities” section of Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.  In addition, refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information regarding legal and regulatory matters contingencies as of September 30, 2025.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance related to disclosures for income taxes (ASU 2023-09).  The amendment requires a public entity to enhance its existing annual tabular reconciliation of its statutory income tax rate to its effective tax rate, with certain reconciling items at or above 5% of the applicable statutory income tax rate broken out by nature and/or jurisdiction.  The guidance also requires an entity to disclose income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, and net amounts paid to an individual jurisdiction when they represent 5% or more of the total income taxes paid.  This new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning in our fiscal 2026 with early adoption permitted, although we do not plan to early adopt.  This guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with retrospective application permitted.  Since this amendment only requires additional disclosures, adoption of this ASU will not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued amended guidance related to disclosure of disaggregated expenses (ASU 2024-03).  This amendment requires public business entities to provide detailed disclosures in the notes to financial statements disaggregating specific expense categories, including employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization, as well as certain other disclosures to provide enhanced transparency into the nature and function of expenses.  This new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning in our fiscal 2028 and interim periods beginning in our fiscal first quarter of 2029 with early adoption permitted, although we do not plan to early adopt.  This guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with retrospective application permitted.  Since this amendment only requires additional disclosures, adoption of this ASU will not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn September 2025, the FASB issued amended guidance related to capitalization of internal-use software costs (ASU 2025-06).  This amendment eliminates references to sequential software development stages and requires capitalization of internal-use software costs once management has authorized and committed to funding the software project and when the probability that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended is evident.  This new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in our fiscal 2029 with early adoption permitted.  This guidance will be applied using a prospective transition approach, with a modified retrospective or full retrospective transition approach permitted.  Since the capitalization of internal-use software costs generally will not change significantly for most types of software under the amendments in this guidance, we do not expect adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  \nIn November 2025, the FASB issued amended guidance related to the accounting for purchased loans (ASU 2025-08).  Under this new guidance, loans acquired without credit deterioration and deemed “seasoned” will be considered purchased seasoned loans and accounted for using the gross-up approach at acquisition (i.e., record the loan at its purchase price and separately record an allowance for expected credit losses).  Seasoned loans include all loans acquired in a business combination, that do \n70\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nnot have “more-than-insignificant” deterioration of credit quality since origination, as well as loans purchased at least 90 days after origination, where the purchaser was not involved in the origination of the loans.  This new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in our fiscal 2028 with early adoption permitted.  This guidance will be applied using a prospective transition approach.  We are evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information regarding accounting guidance adopted during the year ended September 30, 2025.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nRisks are an inherent part of our business and activities and, as a result, we are subject to various uncertainties that may impact our strategic objectives, operations, and financial results.  Management of risk is critical to our fiscal soundness and profitability.  Our risk management framework is comprised of common principles and standards for the management and control of risks that align with our culture and risk appetite.  This framework allows for identification, assessment, monitoring, reporting, and control of various risks, with associates, including senior management, playing an active role in support of this framework.  \nThe principal risks related to our business activities are market, credit, liquidity, operational, model, and compliance.\nGovernance\nRisk oversight and decision-making are supported by a formalized risk governance structure in addition to a three lines of risk management model.  Our Board of Directors, including its Risk Committee and Audit Committee, is responsible for the review and approval of the risk management framework and receives regular updates on risks identified including the assessment, monitoring, and reporting of those risks and related issues.  The Board of Directors, including its Risk Committee and Audit Committee, assists in articulating the firm’s risk appetite.  The RJF Enterprise Risk Management Committee is the senior management-level committee responsible for risk oversight and is supported by additional risk-specific committees.  These committees support effective risk governance by providing a forum for communication, escalation, and risk remediation with representation across all lines of risk management.  Our first line of risk management, which includes all of our businesses, owns its risks and is responsible for identifying, mitigating, and escalating risks arising from its day-to-day activities.  The second line of risk management, which includes Compliance and Risk Management, advises our client-facing businesses and other first-line functions in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risk.  The second line of risk management tests and monitors the effectiveness of controls, as deemed necessary, and escalates risks when appropriate to senior management and the Board of Directors.  The third line of risk management, Internal Audit, independently reviews activities conducted by the previous lines of risk management to assess their management and mitigation of risk, providing additional assurance to the Board of Directors and senior management, with a view toward enhancing our oversight, management, and mitigation of risk.  Our legal department provides legal advice and guidance to each of these three lines of risk management.\nMarket risk\nMarket risk is our risk of loss resulting from the impact of changes in market prices on our trading inventory, derivatives, and investment positions.  We have exposure to market risk primarily through our broker-dealer trading operations and our banking operations.  Through our broker-dealer subsidiaries, we trade fixed income and, to a lesser extent, equity securities and maintain trading inventories to ensure availability of securities to facilitate client transactions.  Inventory levels may fluctuate daily as a result of client demand.  Within our banking operations, we hold investments in an available-for-sale securities portfolio, and from time to time may hold Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan securitizations not yet sold.  Our primary market risks relate to interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, and foreign exchange rates.  Interest rate risk results from changes in levels of interest rates, the volatility of interest rates and mortgage prepayment speeds. Credit spread risk results from change in the market perception of the credit quality of issuers, which can affect the value of credit sensitive instruments such as corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and structured products.  Equity risk results from changes in prices of equity securities.  Foreign exchange risk results from changes in spot prices, forward prices, and volatility of foreign exchange rates.  See Notes 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for fair value and other information regarding our trading inventories, available-for-sale securities, and derivative instruments.\nWe regularly enter into underwriting commitments and, as a result, we may be subject to market risk on any unsold securities issued in the offerings to which we are committed.  Risk exposure is controlled by limiting our participation, the transaction size, or through the syndication process.\n71\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nMarket Risk Management is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting market risks associated with the firm’s trading and derivative portfolios.  While Market Risk Management maintains ongoing communication with the revenue-generating business units, it is independent of such units. \nTrading activities\nWe are exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rate risk, as a result of our trading inventory (primarily comprised of fixed income financial instruments) in our Capital Markets segment.  Changes in the value of our trading inventory may result from fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, macroeconomic factors, investor expectations or risk appetites, liquidity, as well as dynamic relationships between these factors.  We actively manage interest rate risk arising from our fixed income trading inventory through the use of hedging strategies utilizing U.S. Treasuries, exchange traded funds, futures contracts, liquid spread products, and derivatives.\nWe are also exposed to equity price risk as a result of our capital markets activities.  Our broker-dealer activities are generally client-driven, and we hold equity securities as part of our trading inventory to facilitate such activities, although the amounts are not as significant as our fixed income trading inventory.  \nOur primary method for controlling risks within trading inventories is through the use of dollar-based and exposure-based limits.  A hierarchy of limits exists at multiple levels, including firm, business unit, desk (e.g., for equities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds), product sub-type (e.g., below-investment-grade positions) and issuer concentration.  For derivative positions, which are primarily comprised of interest rate swaps, we have established sensitivity-based and foreign exchange spot limits.  Trading positions and derivatives are monitored against these limits through daily reports that are distributed to senior management.\n \nDuring volatile markets, we may temporarily reduce limits and/or choose to pare our trading inventories to reduce risk.\nWe monitor Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) for all of our trading portfolios on a daily basis for risk management purposes and as a result of applying the Fed’s Market Risk Rule (“MRR”) for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios.  The MRR, also known as the “Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk” rule released by the Fed, the OCC, and the FDIC, requires us to calculate VaR for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income, equity, derivatives, and foreign exchange instruments.  VaR is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating potential losses in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence level. \n \nHowever, there are inherent limitations to utilizing VaR including: historical movements in markets may not accurately predict future market movements; VaR does not take into account the liquidity of individual positions; VaR does not estimate losses over longer time horizons; and extended periods of one-directional markets potentially distort risks within the portfolio.  In addition, should markets become more volatile, actual trading losses may exceed VaR results presented on a single day and might accumulate over a longer time horizon.  As a result, management complements VaR with sensitivity analysis and stress testing and employs additional controls such as a daily review of trading results, review of aged inventory, independent review of pricing, monitoring of concentrations, and review of issuer ratings.\nTo calculate VaR, we use models that incorporate historical simulation.  This approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions, such as in interest rates and equity prices, are representative of future changes.  Simulation is based on daily market data for the previous twelve months.  VaR is reported at a 99% confidence level for a one-day time horizon.  Assuming that future market conditions change as they have in the past twelve months, we would expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by our one-day VaR estimates about once every 100 trading days, or two to three times per year on average.  The VaR model is independently reviewed by our Model Risk Management function.  See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Model risk” of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThe modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations that management believes to be reasonable.  However, there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating VaR, and different assumptions or approximations could produce materially different VaR estimates.  As a result, VaR results are more reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.\n72\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nThe following table sets forth the high, low, period-end and average daily one-day VaR for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income and equity instruments, and for our derivatives for the periods and dates indicated. \n \nYear ended September 30, 2025\nPeriod-end VaR\nYear ended September 30,\n$ in millions\nHigh\nLow\nSeptember 30,\n2025\nSeptember 30,\n2024\n$ in millions\n2025\n2024\nDaily VaR\n$\n6\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n2 \nAverage daily VaR\n$\n3\n \n$\n2 \n Our daily VaR reached a high of $6 million on one day due to positions held to support our underwriting activities.  \nWe perform daily back-testing procedures for our VaR model, as defined by the Fed’s MRR, whereby we compare each day’s projected VaR to its regulatory-defined daily trading losses, which exclude fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading.  Regulatory-defined daily trading losses are used to evaluate the performance of our VaR model and are not comparable to our actual daily net revenues.  Based on these daily “ex ante” versus “ex post” comparisons, we determine whether the number of times that regulatory-defined daily trading losses exceed VaR is consistent with our expectations at a 99% confidence level.  During the year ended September 30, 2025, our regulatory-defined daily losses in our trading portfolios exceeded our predicted VaR on three occasions primarily due to heightened market volatility in early April 2025 driven by economic uncertainties surrounding the potential impacts of changes in international trade policy.\nSeparately, RJF provides additional market risk disclosures to comply with the MRR, including 10-day VaR and 10-day Stressed VaR, which are available on our website at \nhttps://www.raymondjames.com/investor-relations/financial-information/filings-and-reports\n within “Other Reports and Information.”\nBanking operations\nOur Bank segment maintains an interest-earning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash, SBL, C&I loans, CRE loans, REIT loans, residential mortgage loans, and tax-exempt loans, as well as an available-for-sale securities portfolio.  These interest-earning assets are primarily funded by client deposits.  Based on the current asset portfolio, our banking operations are subject to interest rate risk.  We analyze interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income, which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid, and the net portfolio valuation, both across a range of interest rate scenarios. \nOne of the objectives of our Asset and Liability Committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates.  This committee uses several measures to monitor and limit interest rate risk in our banking operations, including scenario analysis and economic value of equity (“EVE”).  We utilize hedging strategies using interest rate swaps in our banking operations as a component of our asset and liability management process.  For additional information regarding this hedging strategy, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.  We also manage interest rate risk as part of our liquidity management framework.  See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources” of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nTo ensure that we remain within the tolerances established for net interest income, a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios.  We use simulation models and estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates.  The model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing, prepayment, and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a 12-month time horizon.  Assumptions used in the model include interest rate movement, the slope of the yield curve, and balance sheet composition and growth.\n \nThe model also considers interest rate-related risks such as pricing spreads, pricing of client cash accounts, including deposit betas, and prepayments.  Various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income. \n73\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nThe following table is an analysis of our banking operations’ estimated net interest income over a 12-month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates (expressed in basis points) using our previously described asset/liability model, which assumes a dynamic balance sheet.  While not presented, additional rate scenarios are performed, including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements.  We also perform simulations on time horizons of up to five years to assess longer-term impacts to various interest rate scenarios.  On a quarterly basis, we test expected model results to actual performance.  Additionally, any changes made to key assumptions in the model are documented and approved by the Asset and Liability Committee.\n \nInstantaneous changes in rate \n(1)\nNet interest income\n($ in millions)\nProjected change in\nnet interest income\n+200\n$1,898\n3%\n+100\n$1,891\n2%\n0\n$1,846\n—%\n-100\n$1,765\n(4)%\n-200\n$1,661\n(10)%\n(1)\nOur 0-basis point scenario was based on interest rates as of September 30, 2025 and did not include the impact of the Fed’s October 2025 decrease in short-term interest rates.\nThe preceding table does not include the impacts of an instantaneous change in interest rates on net interest income on assets and liabilities outside of our banking operations or on our RJBDP fees from third-party banks, which are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and are included in “Account and service fees” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Net interest analysis” of this Form 10-K for additional information on our net interest income.\nWe have classified all of our investments in debt securities in our banking operations as available-for-sale and have not classified any of our investments in debt securities as held-to-maturity.  In our available-for-sale securities portfolio, we hold primarily fixed-rate agency-backed MBS, agency-backed CMOs, and U.S. Treasuries, which are carried at fair value on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, with changes in the fair value of the portfolio recorded through other comprehensive income (“OCI”) on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  As the majority of our available-for-sale securities portfolio is comprised of U.S. government and government agency-backed securities, changes in fair value are primarily driven by changes in interest rates.  At September 30, 2025, our available-for-sale securities portfolio had a fair value of $6.89 billion with a weighted-average yield of 2.25% and a weighted-average life, after factoring in estimated prepayments, of 3.8 years. To evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of our available-for-sale securities portfolio we also monitor, among other things, effective duration, defined as the approximate percentage change in price for a 100-basis point change in rates.  As of September 30, 2025, the effective duration of our available-for-sale securities portfolio was approximately 3.44, which means that we would expect the market value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio to increase approximately 3.44% for every 100-basis point decline in interest rates and decline approximately 3.44% for every 100-basis point increase in interest rates.  See Notes 2 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information on our available-for-sale securities portfolio.\nThe Asset and Liability Committee also reviews EVE, which is a point in time analysis of current interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that incorporates cash flows over their estimated remaining lives, discounted at current rates.  The EVE approach is based on a static balance sheet and provides an indicator of future earnings and capital levels as the changes in EVE indicate the anticipated change in the value of future cash flows.  We monitor sensitivity to changes in EVE utilizing Board of Directors-approved limits.  These limits set a risk tolerance to changing interest rates and assist in determining strategies for mitigating this risk as EVE approaches these limits.  As of September 30, 2025, our EVE analyses were within approved limits.\n74\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nThe following table shows the maturities of our bank loan portfolio at September 30, 2025, including contractual principal repayments.  Maturities are generally determined based upon contractual terms; however, rollovers or extensions that are included for the purposes of measuring the allowance for credit losses are reflected in maturities in the following table.  This table does not include any estimates of prepayments, which could shorten the average loan lives and cause the actual timing of the loan repayments to differ significantly from those shown in the table.\n \nDue in\n$ in millions\nOne year or less\n> One year – five\nyears\n> Five years – fifteen years\n> Fifteen years\nTotal\nSBL\n$\n19,546 \n$\n224 \n$\n5 \n$\n— \n$\n19,775\n \nC&I loans\n1,190 \n5,969 \n3,582 \n36 \n10,777\n \nCRE loans\n827 \n5,502 \n1,475 \n36 \n7,840\n \nREIT loans\n439 \n1,251 \n— \n— \n1,690\n \nResidential mortgage loans\n6 \n23 \n145 \n10,121 \n10,295\n \nTax-exempt loans\n131 \n303 \n792 \n— \n1,226\n \nTotal loans held for investment\n22,139 \n13,272 \n5,999 \n10,193 \n51,603\n \nHeld for sale loans\n— \n26 \n159 \n231 \n416\n \nTotal loans held for sale and investment\n$\n22,139\n \n$\n13,298\n \n$\n6,158\n \n$\n10,424\n \n$\n52,019\n \nThe following table shows the distribution of the recorded investment of those bank loans that mature in more than one year between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans at September 30, 2025.\n \nInterest rate type\n$ in millions\nFixed\nAdjustable\nTotal\nSBL\n$\n53 \n$\n176 \n$\n229\n \nC&I loans\n968 \n8,619 \n9,587\n \nCRE loans\n333 \n6,680 \n7,013\n \nREIT loans\n— \n1,251 \n1,251\n \nResidential mortgage loans\n (1)\n208 \n10,081 \n10,289\n \nTax-exempt loans\n1,095 \n— \n1,095\n \nTotal loans held for investment\n2,657 \n26,807 \n29,464\n \nHeld for sale loans\n3 \n413 \n416\n \nTotal loans held for sale and investment\n$\n2,660\n \n$\n27,220\n \n$\n29,880\n \n(1)\nAdjustable rate residential mortgage loans included loans which were still in their fixed-rate period at September 30, 2025 \nContractual loan terms for SBL, C&I loans, CRE loans, REIT loans, and residential mortgage loans may include an interest rate floor, cap and/or fixed interest rates for a certain period of time, which would impact the timing of the interest rate reset for the respective loan.  See the discussion within the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk - Risk monitoring process” section of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio.\nOur banking operations are also subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the USD.  For example, our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in Canadian dollars, totaling $1.00 billion and $1.23 billion at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, when converted to the USD using the spot rate at that time.  A majority of such loans are held in a Canadian subsidiary of Raymond James Bank.  Raymond James Bank utilizes short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign exchange risk related to such investment in this Canadian subsidiary.  These derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the consolidated financial statements.  See Notes 2 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these derivatives.\nOther sources of foreign exchange risk\nInvestments in non-bank foreign subsidiaries\nAt September 30, 2025, we had foreign exchange risk in our investment in RJ Ltd. of CAD 487 million and in our investment in our UK PCG subsidiary of £309 million, which were not hedged.  We had other, less significant investments in foreign domiciled subsidiaries, primarily in Europe, which were not hedged; however, we do not believe we had material foreign exchange risk either individually, or in the aggregate, pertaining to these subsidiaries as of September 30, 2025.  Foreign \n75\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nexchange gains/losses related to our foreign investments are primarily reflected in OCI on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information regarding our components of OCI.\nTransactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the USD\nWe are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the USD.  Any currency-related gains/losses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in “Other” revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  The foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts.  Such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore, the related gains/losses are included in “Other” revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information regarding our derivatives.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrower’s, issuer’s, or counterparty’s ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed-upon terms.  The nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction, and the parties involved.  Credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities.\nCorporate activities\nWe maintain cash balances with the Fed and with various financial institutions, primarily global systemically important financial institutions, in our normal course of business.  A large portion of such balances are in excess of FDIC insurance limits.  As a result, we may be exposed to the risk that these financial institutions may not return our cash to us in the event that the institution experiences financial distress or ceases its operations.  In order to mitigate our credit risk to such financial institutions, we monitor our exposure with each institution on a daily basis and subject each institution to limits based on various factors including but not limited to financial strength, capitalization levels, liquidity, credit ratings, and market factors to the extent applicable.\nBrokerage activities\nWe are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include broker-dealers, banks, exchanges, clearing organizations, and other financial institutions.  We are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations. \n \nIn addition, certain commitments, including underwritings, may create exposure to individual issuers and businesses.\n \nThe risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and/or the issuer of the instrument.  In addition, we may be subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions in or have large commitments to a single counterparty, borrower, or group of similar counterparties or borrowers (e.g., in the same industry).\n \nWe seek to mitigate these risks by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty, conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties, reviewing security, derivative, and loan concentrations, holding collateral as security for certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations, which may guarantee performance.  See Notes 2, 5, and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information about our credit risk mitigation related to derivatives and collateralized agreements.\nOur client activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients.  Client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis.  Credit exposure results from client margin loans, which are monitored daily and are collateralized by the securities in the clients’ accounts.  We monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities on a daily basis in connection with our margin lending activities.  We adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions.  In addition, when clients execute a purchase, we are at some risk that the client will default on their financial obligation associated with the trade.  If this occurs, we may have to liquidate the position at a loss.  See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10‑K for additional information about our determination of the allowance for credit losses associated with certain of our brokerage lending activities.\n76\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nWe offer loans to financial advisors for recruiting and retention purposes.  We have credit risk and may incur a loss primarily in the event that such borrower is no longer affiliated with us.  See Notes 2 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information about our loans to financial advisors.\nBanking operations\nOur Bank segment has a substantial loan portfolio.  Our strategy for credit risk management related to bank loans includes well-defined credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all credit exposures.  The strategy also includes diversification across loan types, geographic locations, industries and clients, regular credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate and tax-exempt loans as well as individual delinquent residential loans.  The credit risk management process also includes periodic independent reviews of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with credit policies, risk ratings, and other critical credit information.  We seek to identify potential problem loans early, record any necessary risk rating changes and charge-offs promptly, and maintain appropriate reserve levels for expected losses.  We use a credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and tax-exempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments.  For our SBL and residential mortgage loans, we utilize the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans.  In evaluating credit risk, we consider trends in loan performance, historical experience through various economic cycles, industry or client concentrations, the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors (both current and forecasted).  These factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net charge-offs.\nWhile our bank loan portfolio is diversified, a significant downturn in the overall economy, deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where we have a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses and/or charge-offs.  We determine the allowance required for specific loan pools based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our methods for determining the allowance for each loan portfolio segment and make enhancements we consider appropriate.  Our allowance for credit losses methodology is described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.  We segregate our bank loan portfolio into six loan portfolio segments, which also serve as classes of financing receivables for purposes of credit analysis.  The risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows.\nSBL: Loans in this segment are primarily collateralized by the borrower’s marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards and, to a lesser extent, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies issued by investment-grade insurance companies.  An insignificant portion of our SBL portfolio is collateralized by private securities or other financial instruments with a limited trading market.  Substantially all SBL are monitored daily for adherence to loan-to-value (“LTV”) guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required LTV, a collateral call is issued.  Past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of the collateral which will bring the loan to a current status.  The vast majority of our SBL qualify for the practical expedient allowed under the CECL guidance whereby we estimate zero credit losses to the extent the fair value of the collateral securing the loan equals or exceeds the related carrying value of the loan.  SBL also generally qualify for lower capital requirements under regulatory capital rules.\nC&I: Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business and repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business.  In addition, we also have certain owner-occupied commercial real estate loans of approximately $175 million as of September 30, 2025 that were classified as C&I loans as the primary source of repayment for these loans is based on the financial strength of the owner and the cash flows of the respective business rather than the ability of the collateral to generate cash flows.  Unfavorable economic and political conditions, including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending, may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.\nCRE: Loans in this segment are primarily secured by income-producing properties.  The underlying cash flows generated by properties securing these loans may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and decreases in rental rates, which are monitored on an ongoing basis.  This portfolio segment includes CRE construction loans which involve risks such as project budget overruns, performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors, or the inability to sell the project or secure permanent financing once the project is completed.  As of September 30, 2025, our CRE construction loans represented less than 1% of total loans held for sale and investment.  With respect to commercial construction of residential developments, there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments.  Adverse information arising from any of these factors may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.\nREIT: Loans in this segment are made to businesses that own or finance income-producing real estate across various property sectors.  This portfolio segment may include extensions of credit to companies that engage in real estate \n77\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\ndevelopment.  Repayment of these loans is dependent on income generated from real estate properties or the sale of real estate.  A portion of this segment may consist of loans secured by residential product types (single-family residential, including condominiums and land held for residential development) within a range of markets.  Deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business, reductions in the value of real estate, as well as increased vacancy and decreases in rental rates may all adversely affect the loans in this segment.\nResidential mortgage (includes home equity loans/lines): All loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower.  We do not originate or purchase adjustable rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans with negative amortization, reverse mortgages, or loans to subprime borrowers.  Loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are also not originated or purchased.  A decline in the strength of the economy, particularly unemployment rates and housing prices, among other factors, could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.\nTax-exempt: Loans in this segment are made to governmental and non-profit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and, in some cases, by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed.  For loans to governmental entities, repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes.  For non-profit entities, repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds.  These loans are subject to demographic risk, therefore much of the credit assessment of tax-exempt loans is driven by the entity’s revenue base and the general economic environment.  Adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.\nThe level of charge-off activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential severity of future credit losses.  The following table presents net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries and the percentage of net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries to the average outstanding loan balances by loan portfolio segment.  \n \nYear ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\n$ in millions\nNet loan \n(charge-off)/recovery \namount\n% of avg.\noutstanding\nloans\nNet loan \n(charge-off)/recovery\namount\n% of avg.\noutstanding\nloans\nNet loan \n(charge-off)/recovery\namount\n% of avg.\noutstanding\nloans\nC&I loans\n$\n(29)\n0.28\n \n%\n$\n(42)\n0.41 \n%\n$\n(44)\n0.40 \n%\nCRE loans\n(11)\n0.14\n \n%\n(21)\n0.28 \n%\n(10)\n0.14 \n%\nResidential mortgage loans\n(1)\n0.01\n \n%\n1 \n0.01 \n%\n— \n— \n%\nTotal loans held for investment\n$\n(41)\n0.08\n \n%\n$\n(62)\n0.14 \n%\n$\n(54)\n0.12 \n%\nThe level of nonperforming assets is another indicator of potential future credit losses.  Nonperforming assets are comprised of both nonperforming loans and other real estate owned.  Nonperforming loans include those loans which have been placed on nonaccrual status and any accruing loans which are 90 days or more past due and in the process of collection.  The following table presents the balance of nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, and related key credit ratios.\nSeptember 30,\n$ in millions\n2025\n2024\nNonperforming loans \n(1)\n$\n186\n \n$\n175 \nNonperforming assets\n$\n187\n \n$\n175 \nNonperforming loans as a % of total loans held for sale and investment\n0.36\n \n%\n0.38 \n%\nAllowance for credit losses as a % of nonperforming loans\n243\n \n%\n261 \n%\nNonperforming assets as a % of Bank segment total assets\n0.29\n \n%\n0.28 \n%\n(1)\nNonperforming loans at September 30, 2025 and 2024 included $109 million and $89 million, respectively, of loans, which were current pursuant to their contractual terms. \nSee table summarizing nonaccrual loans by portfolio segment in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nAlthough our nonperforming assets as a percentage of our Bank segment’s assets remained low as of September 30, 2025, any prolonged period of market deterioration could result in an increase in our nonperforming assets, an increase in our allowance for credit losses and/or an increase in net charge-offs in future periods, although the extent would depend on future developments that are highly uncertain.\n \n78\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nSee further explanation of our bank loan portfolio segments, allowance for credit losses, and the credit loss provision in Notes 2 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Bank” of this Form 10-K. \nLoan underwriting policies\nA component of our Bank segment’s credit risk management strategy is conservative, well-defined policies and procedures.  Our underwriting policies for the major types of bank loans are described in the following sections.\nSBL portfolio\nOur SBL portfolio represented 38% of our total loans held for sale and investment as of September 30, 2025.  This portfolio is primarily comprised of loans fully collateralized by a borrower’s marketable securities and, to a lesser extent, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies issued by investment-grade insurance companies.  An insignificant portion of our SBL portfolio is collateralized by private securities or other financial instruments with a limited trading market.  The underwriting policy for the SBL portfolio primarily includes a review of collateral, including LTV, and a review of repayment history.\nCorporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios\n \nAs of September 30, 2025, our corporate and tax-exempt loans held for investment represented 33% of the Bank segment’s total assets and were comprised of approximately 1,600 borrowers.  A large portion of these loan portfolios was comprised of loans to larger companies, including public companies, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization greater than $100 million.  We also had issued corporate and tax-exempt loans to middle-market businesses.  Our corporate loan portfolio is diversified by geography, by loan type, and among a number of industries in the U.S and Canada, and a large portion of these loans are to borrowers in industries in which we have expertise through coverage provided by our Capital Markets research analysts.  Our corporate loans included project finance real estate loans, commercial lines of credit, and term loans.  As of September 30, 2025, 66% of our corporate loans were participations in Shared National Credit (“SNC”) or other large, syndicated loans.  We are typically either involved in the syndication of the loans at inception or purchase loans in secondary trading markets.  The remainder of our corporate loan portfolio is comprised of smaller participations and direct loans.  Our tax-exempt loans are long-term loans to governmental and non-profit entities.  These loans generally have lower overall credit risk but are subject to other risks that are not usually present with corporate clients, including the risk associated with the constituency served by a local government and the risk in ensuring an obligation has appropriate tax treatment.\nAll corporate and tax-exempt loans are independently underwritten in accordance with our credit policies, are subject to approval by a loan committee, and credit quality is monitored on an ongoing basis by our lending staff.  In addition, corporate and tax-exempt loans are subject to regulatory review.  Our credit policies include criteria related to LTV limits based upon property type, single borrower loan limits, loan term and structure parameters (including guidance on leverage, debt service coverage ratios, and debt repayment ability), industry concentration limits, secondary sources of repayment, municipality demographics, and other criteria.  Our corporate loans are generally secured by all assets of the borrower and in some instances are secured by mortgages on specific real estate.  The majority of our tax-exempt loan portfolio is comprised of loans to investment-grade borrowers, and such loans are generally secured by a pledge of revenue.  In a limited number of transactions, loans in the portfolio are extended on an unsecured basis.  \nResidential mortgage loan portfolio \nOur residential mortgage loan portfolio largely consists of first mortgage loans originated by us via referrals from our PCG financial advisors and the general public, as well as first mortgage loans purchased by us.  Substantially all of our residential mortgage loans adhere to strict underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history, debt-to-income ratio of the borrower, LTV, and combined LTV (including second mortgage/home equity loans).  As of September 30, 2025, 95% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio consisted of owner-occupant borrowers (73% for their primary residences and 22% for second home residences).  Approximately 30% of the first lien residential mortgage loans were ARM loans, which receive interest-only payments based on a fixed rate for an initial period of the loan, ranging from the first five to fifteen years depending on the loan, and then become fully amortizing, subject to annual and lifetime interest rate caps.  A significant portion of our originated 15 or 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market.\n79\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nRisk monitoring process\nAnother component of credit risk strategy for our bank loan portfolio is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes, including our independent loan review process, as well as our processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies.  There are various other factors included in these processes, depending on the loan portfolio.\nSBL and residential mortgage loan portfolios\nSubstantially all collateral securing our SBL portfolio is monitored on a daily basis.  Collateral adjustments, as triggered by our monitoring procedures, are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure our loans are adequately secured, resulting in minimizing our credit risk.  \nWe track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in our residential mortgage loan portfolio.  The factors include, but are not limited to: loan performance trends, loan product parameters and qualification requirements, borrower credit scores, level of documentation, loan purpose, geographic concentrations, average loan size, risk rating, and LTV ratios.  See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe following table presents a summary of delinquent residential mortgage loans, the vast majority of which are first mortgage loans, which are comprised of loans which are two or more payments past due as well as loans in the process of foreclosure.  \n \nAmount of delinquent residential mortgage loans\nDelinquent residential mortgage loans as a percentage of outstanding residential mortgage loan balances\n$ in millions\n30-89 days\n90 days or more\nTotal\n30-89 days\n90 days or more\nTotal\nSeptember 30, 2025\n$\n7\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n13\n \n0.07\n \n%\n0.06\n \n%\n0.13\n \n%\nSeptember 30, 2024\n$\n6 \n$\n8 \n$\n14 \n0.07 \n%\n0.08 \n%\n0.15 \n%\nOur September 30, 2025 percentage of over 30 day delinquent residential mortgage loans compares favorably to the national average of 1.87%, as most recently reported by the Fed.\nTo manage and limit credit losses, we maintain processes to manage our loan delinquencies.  Substantially all of our residential first mortgages are serviced by a third party whereby the primary collection effort resides with the servicer.  Our personnel direct and actively monitor the servicers’ efforts through extensive communications regarding individual loan status changes and through requirements of timely and appropriate collection of property management actions and reporting, including management of third parties used in the collection process (e.g., appraisers, attorneys, etc.).  Residential mortgage loans over 60 days past due are generally reviewed by our personnel monthly and documented in a written report detailing delinquency information, balances, collection status, appraised value, and other data points.  Our senior management meets quarterly to discuss the status, collection strategy and charge-off recommendations on substantially all residential mortgage loans over 60 days past due.  Updated collateral valuations are generally obtained for loans over 90 days past due and charge-offs are typically taken on individual loans based on these valuations generally before the loan is 120 days past due.\nCredit risk is also managed by diversifying the residential mortgage portfolio.  Most of the loans in our residential loan portfolio are to PCG clients across the U.S.  The following table details the geographic concentrations (top five states) of our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.\nSeptember 30, 2025\nState\nLoans outstanding as a % of\n total residential mortgage loans held for sale and investment\nLoans outstanding as a % of\n total loans held for sale and investment\nCalifornia\n21%\n4%\nFlorida\n18%\n4%\nTexas\n8%\n2%\nNew York\n8%\n1%\nColorado\n4%\n1%\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster or severe weather event in any of these states, for example wildfires in California and hurricanes in Florida, could result in additional credit loss provisions and/or charge-offs on our loans in such states and therefore negatively impact our net income and regulatory capital in any given period.  \n80\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nLoans where borrowers may be subject to payment increases include ARM loans with terms that initially require payment of interest only.  Payments may increase significantly when the interest-only period ends and the loan principal begins to amortize.  At September 30, 2025 and 2024, these loans totaled $3.04 billion and $2.96 billion, respectively, or 29% and 31% of the residential mortgage portfolio, respectively.  The weighted-average number of years before the remainder of the loans, which were still in their interest-only period at September 30, 2025, begins amortizing is five years.\nCorporate and tax-exempt loans\nOne way in which we manage credit risk is through diversification of the corporate bank loan portfolio.  We monitor industry concentrations and have established limits relative to capital as part of our overall liquidity and capital planning.  Further, key credit policies are reviewed at least annually by senior bank executives to ensure policies align with our banks’ risk appetites.  Credit policies for our corporate loans include criteria related to single borrower loan limits, loan term and structure parameters (including guidance on leverage, debt service coverage ratios, and debt repayment ability), industry concentration limits, secondary sources of repayment, municipality demographics, and other criteria.  \nTo further mitigate risks related to our CRE portfolio, the expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income-producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect risks related to varying interest rates, vacancy rates, and rental rates.  Credit policies for our CRE loans also include LTV limits based upon property type and, in times of uncertainty, we may originate loans at even tighter thresholds.  CRE loans are also monitored for geographic concentration and total relationship exposure.  Construction CRE loans are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure projects are on time and within budget as part of our credit risk evaluation.  Higher-risk CRE construction loans receive quarterly reviews by senior bank executives.  \nWe actively monitor economic and other factors that may impact our borrowers and corporate loan portfolio which could impact our provision for credit losses in future periods.  Credit risk in our corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios is monitored on an individual loan basis for trends in borrower operating performance, payment history, credit ratings, collateral performance, loan covenant compliance, municipality demographics and other factors including industry performance and concentrations, geographic concentrations, and total relationship exposure.  In addition, credit quality trends are monitored by industry to determine if a change in the risk exposure to a certain industry may warrant incremental monitoring or tightening of our underwriting standards during times of market uncertainty.  We also utilize loan sales and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of our corporate bank loans. \nWe use a credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and tax-exempt loans and the related unfunded lending commitments.  The majority of loans in our corporate loan portfolio are assigned risk ratings based on an assessment of conditions that affect the borrower’s ability to meet contractual obligations under the loan agreement.  This process includes reviewing borrowers’ financial information and other credit-related documentation, public information, and other information specific to each borrower and loan.  As part of the credit review process, the loan rating is reviewed at least annually, or more frequently based on policy requirements regarding various risk characteristics, to confirm the appropriate risk rating for each credit.  The individual loan ratings resulting from semi-annual SNC exams are incorporated in our internal loan ratings when the ratings are received.  If the SNC rating is lower on an individual loan than our internal rating, the loan is downgraded.  While we consider historical SNC exam results in our loan ratings methodology, differences between the SNC exam and internal ratings on individual loans typically arise due to subjectivity of the loan classification process.  Downgrades resulting from these differences may result in additional provisions for credit losses in periods when SNC exam results are received.  See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information on our allowance for credit losses policies.\n81\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIndex\nOur corporate bank loan portfolio does not contain a significant concentration in any single industry.  The following table details the top industry concentrations of our C&I and CRE loans, which comprise the vast majority of our corporate loan portfolio.  \nAs of September 30, 2025\nIndustry\nLoans outstanding as a % of\ntotal corporate bank loans held for sale and investment\nLoans outstanding as a % of\ntotal loans held for sale and investment\nC&I:\nLoan funds\n10%\n4%\nSubscription lines\n5%\n2%\nTransportation and logistics\n4%\n2%\nCRE:\nMulti-family\n12%\n5%\nIndustrial warehouse\n9%\n4%\nOffice real estate\n5%\n2%\nOur C&I loan portfolio includes facilities to support debt funds and private equity firms, primarily in the form of loans to the funds and subscription lines.  Loan funds are generally secured by diversified pools of senior-secured loans or other credit instruments held in bankruptcy-remote vehicles, with collateral monitored by an independent custodian.  Credit exposure is primarily driven by the credit quality and performance of the underlying collateral for loan funds.  Subscription facilities are typically secured by uncalled capital commitments from a diversified base of investment-grade institutional investors and high-net-worth investors, with repayment sourced from capital calls.  Credit exposure is primarily driven by the credit quality and funding reliability of the limited partners for subscription facilities, rather than the performance of underlying fund investments.  These facilities generally have short-term maturities, are structured to mitigate risk through covenant and collateral arrangements, are subject to concentration limits across key risk factors, and exhibit low historical default rates.  While historical defaults have been low, we maintain an allowance for credit losses that we believe is sufficient based on the risk characteristics of this portfolio. \n \nThe collateral securing our CRE loan portfolio is geographically diverse and primarily located throughout the United States.  No single state individually accounted for more than 3% of the total loans held for sale and investment, while our CRE loans with collateral located in Canada represented less than 2%.  \nLiquidity risk\nSee “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources” of this Form 10-K for information regarding our liquidity and how we manage liquidity risk.\nOperational risk\nOperational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, business disruptions, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes, including cybersecurity incidents (see “",
    "item1a": "Item 1A - Risk Factors” and “",
    "item1c": "Item 1C - Cybersecurity” of this Form 10-K, despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, power loss, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations.\nModel risk\nModel risk refers to the possibility of unintended business outcomes arising from the design, implementation or use of models.  Models are used throughout the firm for a variety of purposes such as the valuation of financial instruments, the calculation of our allowance for credit losses, assessing risk, stress testing, and to assist in making certain business decisions.  Model risk includes the potential risk that management makes incorrect decisions based upon either incorrect model results or incorrect understanding and use of model results.  Model risk may also occur when model outputs differ from the expected result.  Model errors or misuse could result in significant financial loss, inaccurate financial or regulatory reporting, or misaligned business strategies.\nModel Risk Management is a separate department within our Risk Management department and is independent of model owners, users, and developers.  Our model risk management framework consists primarily of model governance, maintaining the firmwide model inventory, validating and approving models used across the firm, and ongoing monitoring.  Validation issues identified are reported to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.  Model Risk Management assumes responsibility for the independent and effective challenge of model completeness, integrity and design based on intended use.\nCompliance risk\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or reputational damage that the firm may suffer from a failure to comply with applicable laws, external standards, or internal requirements.\nWe have established a framework to oversee, manage, and mitigate compliance risk throughout the firm, both within and across businesses, functions, legal entities, and jurisdictions.  The framework includes roles and responsibilities for the Board of Directors, senior management, and all three lines of risk management.  This framework also includes programs and processes through which the firm identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors, and reports on compliance risk and provides compliance-related training throughout the firm.  The Compliance department plays a key leadership role in the oversight, management, and mitigation of compliance risk throughout the firm.  It does this by conducting an annual compliance risk assessment, carrying out compliance monitoring and testing activities, implementing compliance policies, training associates on compliance-related topics, and reporting compliance risk-related issues and metrics to the Board of Directors and senior management, among other activities.\nITEM 7A.  \nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nSee “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management” of this Form 10-K for our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.\n83\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nIndex\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nRaymond James Financial, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Raymond James Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2025, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated November 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAssessment of the allowance for credit losses related to the commercial and industrial (C&I) and the commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio segments that are collectively evaluated for impairment \nAs discussed in Note 2 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans was $452 million as of September 30, 2025, a portion of which related to the Raymond James Bank (“Bank”) allowance for credit losses (ACL) on C&I and CRE portfolio segments evaluated on a collective basis (the collective ACL). The Company estimates the collective ACL using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical losses, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions that affect the collectability of loan balances. The collective ACL is a product of multiplying the Company’s \n85\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nIndex\nestimates of probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default. The Company uses third-party historical information combined with macroeconomic variables over the reasonable and supportable forecast periods based on a single economic forecast scenario to estimate the PDs and LGDs. After the reasonable and supportable forecast periods, for the C&I portfolio segment, the Company reverts to historical loss information over a one-year period using a straight-line reversion approach. For the CRE portfolio segment, the Company incorporates a reasonable and supportable forecast of various macroeconomic variables over the remaining life of the assets. The estimated PDs and LGDs are applied to estimated exposure at default considering the contractual loan term adjusted for expected prepayments to estimate expected losses. Adjustments are made to the collective ACL to reflect certain qualitative factors that are not incorporated into the quantitative models and related estimate. \nWe identified the assessment of the September 30, 2025 collective ACL on Raymond James Bank loans related to the C&I and CRE portfolio segments as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the September 30, 2025 collective ACL methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate the PDs and LGDs and their significant assumptions. Such significant assumptions included portfolio segmentation, risk ratings, the selection of the single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic variables, the reasonable and supportable forecast periods and the reversion periods, and third-party historical information. The assessment also included the evaluation of the qualitative factors by portfolio segment. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD and LGD models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s measurement of the September 30, 2025 collective ACL estimate on Raymond James Bank loans related to the C&I and CRE portfolio segments, including controls over the:\n•\ndevelopment of the collective ACL methodology on Bank loans related to the C&I and CRE portfolio segments\n•\ndevelopment of the PD and LGD models \n•\nidentification and determination of the significant assumptions used in the PD and LGD models\n•\ndevelopment of the qualitative methodology and factors \n•\nperformance monitoring of the PD and LGD models \n•\nanalysis of the collective ACL on Bank loans related to the C&I and CRE portfolio segments results, trends, and ratios.\nWe evaluated the Company’s process to develop the September 30, 2025 collective ACL estimate on Bank loans related to the C&I and CRE portfolio segments by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n•\nevaluating the Company’s collective ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \n•\nevaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the development and performance testing of the PD and LGD models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices\n•\nassessing the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD and LGD models by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for the intended use\n•\nevaluating the selection of the economic forecast scenario and underlying macroeconomic variables by comparing it to the Company’s business environment and relevant industry practices\n•\nevaluating the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast periods and the reversion periods by comparing them to specific portfolio segment risk characteristics and trends \n•\ndetermining whether the loan portfolio is segmented by similar risk characteristics by comparing to the Company’s business environment and relevant industry practices \n•\nevaluating the relevance of third-party historical information used by comparing to specific portfolio segment risk characteristics\n•\nperforming credit file reviews on a selection of loans to assess loan characteristics or risk ratings by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral and \n•\nevaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative factors and the effect of certain factors on the allowance for credit losses on Bank loans compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models.\n86\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nIndex\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2025\nNOTE 1 – \nORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nOrganization\nRaymond James Financial, Inc. (“RJF” or the “firm”) is a financial holding company which, together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in various financial services activities, including providing investment management services to retail and institutional clients, merger & acquisition and advisory services, the underwriting, distribution, trading, and brokerage of equity and debt securities, and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products.  The firm also provides corporate and retail banking services and trust services.  For additional information about our business segments, see Note 25.  As used herein, the terms “our,” “we,” or “us” refer to RJF and/or one or more of its subsidiaries.\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RJF and its consolidated subsidiaries that are generally controlled through a majority voting interest.  We consolidate all of our \n100\n%-owned subsidiaries.  In addition, we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) in which we are the primary beneficiary.  Additional information on these VIEs is provided in Note 2 and in Note 9.  When we do not have a controlling interest in an entity, but we exert significant influence over the entity, we apply the equity method of accounting.  All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAccounting estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 2 - \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRecent accounting developments\nAccounting guidance recently adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued amended guidance related to disclosures for segment reporting (ASU 2023-07).  The amendment requires a public entity to disclose on an annual and interim basis, for each reportable segment, the significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss.  The guidance also requires a public entity to disclose, for each reportable segment, an amount for other segment items (those not captured as a significant expense) and the reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss.  We adopted this guidance on a retrospective basis as of October 1, 2024.  Since this amendment only requires additional disclosures, adoption did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  Refer to Note 25 for additional disclosures required by this guidance.\nSignificant accounting policies\nRecognition of non-interest revenues\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized when promised services are delivered to our customers in an amount we expect to receive in exchange for those services (i.e., the transaction price).  Contracts with customers can include multiple services, which are accounted for as separate “performance obligations” if they are determined to be distinct.  Our performance obligations to our customers are generally satisfied when we transfer the promised service to our customer, either at a point in time or over time.  Revenue from a performance obligation transferred at a point in time is recognized at the time that the customer obtains control over the promised service.  Revenue from our performance obligations satisfied over time is \n93\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nrecognized in a manner that depicts our performance in transferring control of the service, which is generally measured based on time elapsed, as our customers receive the benefit of our services as they are provided.\nPayment for the majority of our services is considered to be variable consideration, as the amount of revenue we expect to receive is subject to factors outside of our control, including market conditions.  Variable consideration is only included in revenue when amounts are not subject to significant reversal, which is generally when uncertainty around the amount of revenue to be received is resolved.  We record deferred revenue from contracts with customers when payment is received prior to the performance of our obligation to the customer.\nWe involve third parties in providing services to the customer for certain of our contracts with customers.  We are generally deemed to control the promised services before they are transferred to the customer.  Accordingly, we present the related revenues gross of the related costs.\nWe have elected the practical expedient allowed by the accounting guidance to not disclose information about remaining performance obligations pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less.  See Note 20 for additional information on our revenues.\nAsset management and related administrative fees\nWe earn asset management and related administrative fees for performing asset management, portfolio management and related administrative services to retail and institutional clients.  Such fees are generally based on the values of our Private Client Group (“PCG”) client assets in fee-based accounts and fee-billable assets managed by our Raymond James Investment Management division (“Raymond James Investment Management”), with certain propriety mutual fund fees based on the net asset value of the fund.  Asset values are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets.  Fees are generally collected quarterly and are based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter or at the end of the quarter, or average balances throughout the quarter.  Asset management and related administrative fees are recognized on a monthly basis (i.e., over time) as the services are performed.\nRevenues related to fee-based accounts under administration in PCG are shared by the PCG and Asset Management segments, the amount of which depends on whether clients are invested in “managed programs” that are overseen by our Asset Management segment (i.e., included in financial assets under management (“AUM”) in the Asset Management segment) and the administrative services provided.  The Asset Management segment receives a higher portion of the revenues related to accounts invested in managed programs, as compared to the portion received for non-managed programs, as it is performing portfolio management services in addition to administrative services.  Asset management revenues earned by Raymond James Investment Management for retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts and proprietary mutual funds that we manage are recorded entirely in the Asset Management segment.\nBrokerage revenues\nSecurities commissions\nMutual and other fund products and insurance and annuity products\nWe earn revenues for distribution and related services performed related to mutual and other funds, fixed and variable annuities, and insurance products.  Depending on the product sold, we may receive an upfront fee for our services, a trailing commission, or some combination thereof.  Upfront commissions received are generally based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to amounts invested or the value of the contract at the time of sale and are generally recognized at the time of sale.  Trailing commissions are generally based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the net asset value of the fund, or the value of the insurance policy or annuity contract.  Trailing commissions on eligible products are generally received monthly or quarterly over the period that our client holds the investment or holds the contract.  As these trailing commissions are based on factors outside of our control, including market movements and client behavior (i.e., how long clients hold their investment, insurance policy, or annuity contract), such revenue is recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur.\n94\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nEquities, ETFs, and fixed income products\nWe earn commissions for executing and clearing transactions for clients, primarily in listed and over-the-counter equity securities, including exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), options, and fixed income products.  Such revenues primarily arise from transactions for retail clients in our PCG segment, as well as services related to sales and trading activities transacted on an agency basis in our Capital Markets segment.  Commissions are recognized on trade date, generally received from the customer on settlement date, and we record a receivable between the trade date and the date collected from the customer.\nPrincipal transactions\nPrincipal transactions include revenues from clients’ purchases and sales of financial instruments in which we transact on a principal basis, including fixed income products, equity securities, and derivatives.  We make markets in certain fixed income debt instruments and carry inventories to facilitate such transactions.  The gains and losses on such inventories, as well as gains or losses on derivative transactions, both realized and unrealized, are reported as principal transactions revenues.\nAccount and service fees\nMutual fund and other investment products\nWe earn servicing fees for providing sales and marketing support to third-party financial entities and for supporting the availability and distribution of their products on our platforms.  We also earn servicing fees for accounting and administrative services provided to such parties.  These fees, which are received monthly or quarterly, are generally based on the market value of the related assets, a fixed annual fee or, in certain cases, the number of positions in such programs, and are recognized over time as the services are performed. \nRaymond James Bank Deposit Program (“RJBDP”) fees\nWe earn servicing fees from various banks for administrative services we provide related to our clients’ deposits that are swept to such banks as part of the Raymond James Bank Deposit Program, our multi-bank sweep program.  The amounts received from third-party banks are variable in nature and fluctuate based on average client cash balances in the program, as well as the level of short-term interest rates and the interest paid to clients by the third-party banks on balances in the RJBDP.  The fees are earned over time as the related administrative services are performed and are received monthly.  Our PCG segment also earns servicing fees from our Bank segment, which is calculated as the greater of a base servicing fee or a net yield equivalent to the average yield that the firm would otherwise receive from third-party banks in the RJBDP.  These intersegment fees, and the offsetting intersegment expense in the Bank segment, are eliminated in consolidation.\nInvestment banking\nWe earn revenues from investment banking transactions, including the underwriting and placement of public and private equity and debt securities, private capital fundraising, merger & acquisition advisory services, and other advisory services.  The fees we earn are generally based on the amount of the transaction (e.g., the amount financed), as well as our role in the transaction.  Underwriting revenues, which are typically deducted from the proceeds remitted to the issuer, are recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount to be received.  Fees from merger & acquisition and advisory services are generally recognized at the time the services related to the transaction are completed under the terms of the engagement.  Fees for merger & acquisition and advisory services are typically received upfront, as non-refundable retainer fees, and/or upon completion of a transaction as a success fee.  Expenses related to investment banking transactions are generally deferred until the related revenues are recognized or the services are otherwise concluded.  Such expenses, when recognized, are included in “Professional fees” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nCash and cash equivalents\nOur cash equivalents include money market funds or highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less as of our date of purchase, other than those held for trading purposes.\n95\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nAssets segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash\nWe segregate assets for regulatory and other purposes predominantly related to client activity.  Our broker-dealers carrying client accounts are generally subject to requirements to maintain cash or qualified securities on deposit in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of their clients.  Such amounts are included in “Assets segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of each respective period end.  These amounts largely include cash and cash equivalents but may also include highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasury securities (“U.S. Treasuries”), which are carried at fair value on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  These assets are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nWe may also from time to time be required to restrict cash for other corporate purposes.  In addition, Raymond James Ltd. (“RJ Ltd.”) holds client Registered Retirement Savings Plan funds in trust in accordance with Canadian retirement plan regulations.\nCollateralized agreements and financings\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase\nWe purchase securities under short-term agreements to resell (“reverse repurchase agreements”).  Additionally, we sell securities under short-term agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”).  Reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized agreements and collateralized financings, respectively, and are carried at contractual amounts plus accrued interest.  We receive collateral with a fair value that is typically equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned under reverse repurchase agreements to mitigate credit exposure.  To ensure that the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral values are evaluated on a daily basis, and collateral is obtained from or returned to the counterparty when contractually required.  Under repurchase agreements, we are required to post collateral in an amount that typically exceeds the carrying value of these agreements.  In the event that the market value of the securities we pledge as collateral declines, we may have to post additional collateral or reduce borrowing amounts.  Reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are included in “Collateralized agreements” and “Collateralized financings,” respectively, on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\n  See Note 6 for additional information regarding collateralized agreements and financings.\nSecurities borrowed and securities loaned\nWe may act as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one counterparty and then either lend them to another counterparty or use them in our broker-dealer operations to cover short positions or finance certain firm activities.  Where permitted, we have also loaned, to broker-dealers and other financial institutions, securities owned by the firm or our clients or others we have received as collateral.  Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are accounted for as collateralized agreements and collateralized financings, respectively, and are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received.  In securities borrowed transactions, we are required to deposit cash with the lender in an amount which is generally in excess of the market value of securities borrowed.  With respect to securities loaned, we generally receive cash in an amount in excess of the market value of securities loaned.  We evaluate the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis, with additional collateral exchanged as necessary.  Securities borrowed and securities loaned are included in “Collateralized agreements” and “Collateralized financings,” respectively, on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\n  See Note 6 for additional information regarding collateralized agreements and financings.\n96\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nFinancial instruments, financial instrument liabilities, at fair value\n“Financial instruments” and “Financial instrument liabilities” are recorded at fair value.  Fair value is defined by GAAP as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\nIn determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with GAAP, we use various valuation approaches, including market and/or income approaches.  Our fair value measurements reflect assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  GAAP provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements.\nLevel 1 - Financial instruments included in Level 1 are highly liquid instruments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Financial instruments reported in Level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date (i.e., prices for similar instruments).\nLevel 3 - Financial instruments reported in Level 3 have little, if any, market activity and are measured using one or more inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.  These valuations require judgment and estimation.  These instruments are generally valued using discounted cash flow techniques.\nGAAP requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements.  The availability of observable inputs can vary by instrument and, in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, an instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument.\nValuation techniques and inputs\nThe fair values of certain financial instruments are derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve management judgment.  The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments.  Financial instruments which are actively traded will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are less frequently traded.  In accordance with GAAP, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability.  For debt securities, our definition of actively traded is based on security type, considering liquidity and price transparency.  For equity securities, our definition of actively traded is based on average daily trading volume.  We have determined the market for other types of financial instruments to be uncertain or inactive as of both September 30, 2025 and 2024.  As a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available.\nThe level within the fair value hierarchy, specific valuation techniques, and other significant accounting policies pertaining to financial instruments at fair value on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition are described as follows.\nTrading assets and trading liabilities\nTrading assets and trading liabilities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our broker-dealer subsidiaries and include debt securities, equity securities, brokered certificates of deposit, and other financial instruments.  Trading assets and trading liabilities are recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses reflected in “Principal transactions” in current period net income.\nWhen available, we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of our trading assets and trading liabilities.  Such instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nWhen trading instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices for identical instruments do not exist, we utilize valuation techniques, including matrix pricing, to estimate fair value.  Matrix pricing generally utilizes spread-based models periodically re-calibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments.  Valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves, \n97\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\ninterest rates and expected principal prepayments and default probabilities.  We utilize prices from third-party pricing services to corroborate our estimates of fair value.  Depending upon the type of security, the pricing service may provide a listed price, a matrix price or use other methods.  Securities valued using these techniques are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nWithin each broker-dealer subsidiary, we offset our long and short positions for identical securities recorded at fair value as part of our trading assets (long positions) and trading liabilities (short positions).\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nAvailable-for-sale securities, which are held in our Bank segment, are classified at the date of purchase.  They are comprised primarily of agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), agency collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), U.S. Treasuries, and other securities which a\nre guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies. \n Available-for-sale securities are used as part of our interest rate risk and liquidity management strategies.\nThe fair values of our available-for-sale securities are determined by obtaining prices from third-party pricing services, which are primarily based on valuation models.  The third-party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing observable market data for similar securities.  Such observable market data is comprised of benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data (including market research publications), and loan performance experience.  We utilize other third-party pricing services to corroborate the pricing information obtained from the primary pricing service.  The majority of our available-for-sale securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; however, certain available-for-sale securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nInterest on available-for-sale securities is recognized in interest income on an accrual basis, with the related accrued interest not yet received reflected in “Other receivables” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized as an adjustment to yield over the estimated average life of the security, after factoring in the impact of prepayments.  Unrealized gains or losses due to market factors on available-for-sale securities are recorded through other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”), net of applicable taxes, and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  Realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities are recognized using the specific identification method and are reflected in “Other” revenue in the period sold.\n \nDerivative assets and derivative liabilities\nOur derivative assets and derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value and are included in “Derivative assets” and “Derivative liabilities” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  To reduce credit exposure on certain of our derivative transactions, we may enter into a master netting arrangement that allows for net settlement of all derivative transactions with each counterparty within the same subsidiary.  In addition, the credit support annex allows parties to the master netting agreement to mitigate their credit risk by requiring the party which is out of the money to post collateral.  Generally the collateral we accept is in the form of either cash or marketable securities.  Where permitted, we elect to net-by-counterparty certain derivatives entered into under a legally enforceable master netting agreement and, therefore, the fair value of those derivatives are netted by counterparty on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  As we elect to net-by-counterparty the fair value of such derivatives, we also net-by-counterparty cash collateral exchanged as part of those derivative agreements.  Collateral received in the form of marketable securities is not offset as part of such derivative agreements.  \nWe may also require certain counterparties to make a cash deposit at the inception of a derivative agreement, referred to as “initial margin.”  This initial margin is included in “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Other payables” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  We are also required to maintain deposits with the clearing organizations we utilize to clear certain of our interest rate derivatives, for which we have generally posted securities as collateral.  This initial margin is included as a component of “Other investments” and “Available-for-sale securities” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  On a daily basis, we also pay cash to, or receive cash from, these clearing organizations due to changes in the fair value of the derivatives which they clear.  Such payments are referred to as “variation margin” and are considered to be settlement of the related derivatives.\n98\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nInterest rate derivatives\nWe enter into interest rate derivatives as part of our trading activities in our fixed income business to facilitate client transactions or to actively manage risk exposures that arise from our client activity, including a portion of our trading inventory.  In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives with clients of our Bank segment, including clients with whom we have entered into loans or other lending arrangements, to facilitate their respective interest rate risk management strategies.  The majority of these derivatives are traded in the over-the-counter market and are executed directly with another counterparty with certain of these derivatives cleared and settled through a clearing organization.  Gains or losses related to the change in fair value of derivatives, including due to interest rates, are recorded in “Principal transactions” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  The fair values of these interest rate derivatives are obtained from internal or third-party pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value, yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions.  Since these model inputs can be observed in liquid markets and the models do not require significant judgment, such derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  We corroborate the output of our internal pricing models by preparing an independent calculation using a third-party model.  Our fixed income business also holds to-be-announced security contracts that are accounted for as derivatives, which are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nWe enter into floating-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) to, in part, fund lending and investing activities in our Bank segment and then enter into interest rate contracts which swap variable interest payments of such borrowings for fixed interest payments.  We also enter into interest rate contracts which swap variable interest payments associated with certain money market and saving account deposits for fixed interest payments.  These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and effectively fix a portion of our Bank segment’s cost of funds and mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with its lending and investing activities.  The gains or losses on our Bank segment’s cash flow hedges are recorded, net of tax, in shareholders’ equity as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, specifically upon the incurrence of interest expense on the hedged borrowings and deposits.  Hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and at each reporting period utilizing regression analysis.  As the key terms of the hedging instrument and hedged transaction match at inception, management expects the hedges to be effective while they are outstanding.  The fair value of these interest rate swaps is determined by obtaining valuations from a third-party pricing service.  These third-party valuations are based on observable inputs such as time value and yield curves.  We validate these observable inputs by preparing our own independent calculation using a secondary model.  Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged.  Cash flows from derivative instruments used to manage interest rates are classified as operating activities.  We classify these derivatives within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nForeign-exchange derivatives\nWe enter into three-month forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge the risks related to Raymond James Bank’s investment in its Canadian subsidiary, as well as its risk resulting from transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  The majority of these derivatives are designated as net investment hedges.  The gains or losses related to these designated net investment hedges are recorded, net of tax, in shareholders’ equity as part of the cumulative translation adjustment component of AOCI.  In the event the net investment is sold or substantially liquidated, the associated cumulative translation adjustment, including amounts related to the net investment hedge, are reclassified to “Other” revenues.  Gains and losses on undesignated foreign exchange derivative instruments are recorded in “Other” revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  Hedge effectiveness is assessed at each reporting period using a method that is based on changes in forward rates and measured using the hypothetical derivatives method.  As the terms of the hedging instrument and hypothetical derivative generally match at inception, the hedge is expected to be highly effective.\nThe fair values of our forward foreign exchange contracts are determined by obtaining valuations from a third-party pricing service or model.  These valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates, forward foreign exchange rates and both U.S. and foreign interest rate curves.  We validate the observable inputs utilized in the third-party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary valuation model.  These forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nOther investments\nOther investments consist primarily of private equity investments, securities pledged as collateral with clearing organizations, and term deposits with Canadian financial institutions.  Our securities pledged as collateral with clearing organizations, which primarily include U.S. Treasuries, and term deposits are categorized within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n99\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nPrivate equity investments consist primarily of investments in third-party private equity funds.  The private equity funds in which we invest are primarily closed-end funds in which our investments are generally not eligible for redemption.  We receive distributions from these funds as the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed.  These investments are measured at fair value with any gains or losses recognized in “Other” revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  The fair values of substantially all of our private equity investments are determined utilizing the net asset value (“NAV”) of the fund as a practical expedient with the remainder utilizing Level 3 valuation techniques.\nClient-owned fractional shares\nWithin our broker-dealer subsidiaries, when dividend reinvestment programs or other corporate action events result in clients receiving a share quantity that is not a whole number, we transact in the fractional shares on a principal basis.  We include these fractional shares in “Other assets” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and record an associated liability to the client in “Other payables” as we must fulfill our clients’ future fractional share redemptions.  We account for the fractional share assets and related repurchase liabilities at fair value.  The fair values of the fractional share assets and liabilities are determined based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n \nBrokerage client receivables, net\nBrokerage client receivables include receivables from the clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and are principally for amounts due on cash and margin transactions.  Such receivables are generally collateralized by securities owned by the clients.  Securities beneficially owned by clients, including those that collateralize margin or other similar transactions, are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  See Note 6 for additional information regarding this collateral.   Brokerage client receivables are reported at their outstanding principal balance, net of any allowance for credit losses.  See the “Allowance for credit losses” section below for a discussion of our application of the practical expedient under the CECL guidance for financial assets secured by collateral. \n \nOther receivables, net\nOther receivables primarily include receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations, receivables related to the RJBDP, accrued interest receivables, and accrued fees from product sponsors.  Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of cash deposits placed with clearing organizations, which includes cash deposited as initial margin, as well as receivables related to sales of securities which have traded but not yet settled including amounts receivable for securities failed to deliver.\nWe present “Other receivables, net” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, net of any allowance for credit losses.  However, these receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements and therefore, the allowance for credit losses on such receivables is not significant.  Any allowance for credit losses for other receivables is estimated using assumptions based on historical experience, current facts and other factors.  We update these estimates through periodic evaluations against actual trends experienced.\nWe include accrued interest receivables related to our financial assets in “Other receivables, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  We reverse any uncollectible accrued interest against interest income when the related financial asset is moved to nonaccrual status.  Given that we write off uncollectible amounts in a timely manner, we do not recognize an allowance for credit losses against accrued interest receivable.\nBank loans, net\nLoans held for investment\nBank loans are comprised of loans originated or purchased by our Bank segment and include securities-based loans (“SBL”), commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans, commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans, real estate investment trust (“REIT”) loans, residential mortgage loans, and tax-exempt loans.  The loans which we have the intent and the ability to hold until maturity or payoff are recorded at their unpaid principal balance plus any premium paid in connection with the purchase of the loan or less any discounts received in connection with the purchase of the loan, less the allowance for credit losses and charge-offs, and net of deferred fees and costs on originated loans.  Loan origination fees and direct costs, as well as premiums and discounts on loans that are not revolving, are capitalized and recognized in interest income using the effective interest method, taking into consideration scheduled payments and prepayments.  Loan discounts include fair value adjustments associated with our acquisition of TriState Capital Bank which are accreted into interest income over the weighted-average life of the underlying \n100\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nloans, estimated to approximate \nfour years\n as of the acquisition date, which may vary based on prepayments.  For revolving loans, the straight-line method is used based on the contractual term.  Syndicated loans purchased in the secondary market are recorded on the trade date.  Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.\nWe segregate our loan portfolio into \nsix\n loan portfolio segments, which also serve as classes of financing receivables for purposes of credit analysis. These portfolio segments are: SBL, C&I, CRE (primarily loans that are secured by income-producing properties and CRE construction loans), REIT (loans made to businesses that own or finance income-producing real estate), residential mortgage, and tax-exempt.  Loans in our SBL portfolio segment are primarily collateralized by the borrower’s marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards and, to a lesser extent, the cash surrender value of any applicable life insurance policies.  An insignificant portion of our SBL portfolio is collateralized by private securities or other financial instruments with a limited trading market.  See Note 7 for additional information on our bank loans held for investment.  See the “Allowance for credit losses” section below for information on our allowance policies.\nLoans held for sale\nCertain residential mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market due to their fixed interest rate terms are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value.  The fair values of the residential mortgage loans held for sale are estimated using observable prices obtained from counterparties for similar loans.  These nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nWe purchase t\nhe guaranteed portions of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans and account f\nor these loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value.  We then aggregate SBA loans with similar characteristics into pools for securitization and sell these pools in the secondary market.  Individual SBA loans may be sold prior to securitization.  The fair values of the SBA loans which have not yet been securitized are determined based upon their committed sales price, third-party price quotes, or are determined using a third-party pricing service.  These nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nOnce the SBA loans are securitized into a pool, the respective securities are classified as trading instruments based on our intention to sell the securities and are carried at fair value.  Sales of the securitizations are accounted for as of settlement date, which is the date we have surrendered control over the transferred assets.  We do not retain any interest in the securitizations once they are sold.  \nCorporate loans, which include C&I, CRE and REIT loans, as well as tax-exempt loans are designated as held for investment upon inception and recorded in loans receivable.  If we subsequently designate a corporate or tax-exempt loan as held for sale, which generally occurs as part of our credit management activities, we then write down the carrying value of the loan with a partial charge-off, if necessary, to carry it at the lower of cost or estimated fair value.  The fair value estimate is based on collateral value less selling costs for the collateral-dependent loans and discounted cash flows for loans that are not collateral-dependent.  These nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nGains and losses on sales of residential mortgage loans held for sale, SBA loans that are not part of a securitized pool, and corporate loans transferred from the held for investment portfolio, are included as a component of “Other” revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, while interest collected on these assets is included in “Interest income.”\nUnfunded lending commitments\nWe have outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend credit and other credit-related off-balance-sheet financial instruments such as revolving lines of credit, standby letters of credit and loan purchases.  Our policy is generally to require customers to pledge collateral at the time of closing.  The amount of collateral pledged, if it is deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower.  Collateral securing unfunded lending commitments varies but may include assets such as marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, real estate, and income-producing commercial properties.\nIn the normal course of business, we issue or participate in the issuance of standby letters of credit whereby we provide an irrevocable guarantee of payment in the event the letter of credit is drawn down by the beneficiary.  These standby letters of credit generally expire in \none year\n or less.  In the event that a letter of credit is drawn down, we would pursue repayment from the party under the existing borrowing relationship or would liquidate collateral, or both.  The proceeds from repayment or liquidation of collateral are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn down under the existing letters of credit.\n101\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nThe allowance for potential credit losses associated with these unfunded lending commitments is included in “Other payables” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  Refer to the “Allowance for credit losses” section that follows for a discussion of the reserve calculation methodology and Note 18 for additional information about these commitments.\nWe recognize the revenue associated with corporate syndicated standby letters of credit, which is generally received quarterly, on a cash basis, the effect of which does not differ significantly from recognizing the revenue in the period the fee is earned.  Unused corporate line of credit fees are accounted for on an accrual basis.\nLoan modifications\nIn the normal course of business, we may modify the original terms of a loan agreement.  In certain circumstances, we may agree to modify the original terms of a loan agreement to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, which may include a borrower in default, financial distress, bankruptcy, or other circumstances.  Modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce our loss exposure while providing borrowers with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy.  Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty typically involve principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay (i.e., payment or maturity forbearance greater than six months), or a term extension, or any combination thereof.  Modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are subject to our nonaccrual policies.  See the “Nonperforming assets” section below for information on our nonaccrual policies.\nNonperforming assets\nNonperforming assets are comprised of both nonperforming loans and other real estate owned.  Nonperforming loans include those loans which have been placed on nonaccrual status and any accruing loans which are 90 days or more past due and in the process of collection.  \nLoans of all classes are generally placed on nonaccrual status when we determine that full payment of all contractual principal and interest is in doubt or the loan is past due \n90\n days or more as to contractual interest or principal unless the loan, in our opinion, is well-secured and in the process of collection.  When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is written-off against interest income and accretion of the net deferred loan origination fees ceases.  Interest is recognized using the cash method for SBL and substantially all residential mortgage loans, and the cost recovery method for corporate and tax-exempt loans thereafter until the loan qualifies for return to accrual status.  Most loans are returned to an accrual status when the loans have been brought contractually current with the original or amended terms and have been maintained on a current basis for a reasonable period, generally \nsix months\n.  However, corporate loans that have been partially charged off generally remain on nonaccrual status until such loans are fully repaid or sold.\nOther real estate acquired in the settlement of loans, including through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure, is initially recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs through a charge to the allowance for credit losses, thus establishing a new cost basis.  Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed and the assets are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, as determined by a current appraisal or discounted cash flow valuation less estimated costs to sell, and are included in “Other assets” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  These nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nBank loan charge-off policies\nCorporate and tax-exempt loans are monitored on an individual basis, and loan grades are reviewed at least quarterly to ensure they reflect the loan’s current credit risk.  When we determine that it is likely that a corporate or tax-exempt loan will not be collected in full, the loan is evaluated for a potential write down of the carrying value.  After consideration of a number of factors, including the borrower’s ability to restructure the loan, alternative sources of repayment, and other factors affecting the borrower’s ability to repay the debt, the portion of the loan deemed to be a confirmed loss, if any, is charged-off.  For collateral-dependent loans secured by real estate, the amount of the loan considered a confirmed loss and charged-off is generally equal to the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the collateral’s appraised value less estimated costs to sell.  For C&I and tax-exempt loans, we evaluate all sources of repayment to arrive at the amount considered to be a loss and charged-off.  Corporate banking and credit risk managers also meet regularly to review criticized loans (i.e., loans that are rated special mention or worse as defined by bank regulators).  Additional charge-offs are taken when the value of the collateral changes or there is an adverse change in the expected cash flows.\nA portion of our corporate loan portfolio is comprised of participations in either Shared National Credits (“SNCs”) or other large syndicated loans in the U.S. and Canada.  The SNCs are U.S. loan syndications totaling over $\n100\n million that are shared \n102\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nbetween \nthree\n or more regulated institutions.  The agent bank’s regulator reviews a portion of SNC loans on a semi-annual basis and provides a synopsis of each loan’s regulatory classification, including loans that are designated for nonaccrual status and directed charge-offs.  We must be at least as critical as the agent bank’s regulator with our nonaccrual designations, directed charge-offs, and classifications, potentially impacting our allowance for credit losses and charge-offs.  Corporate loans are subject to our internal review procedures and regulatory review by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“the Fed”) and either the Florida Office of Financial Regulation or the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities as part of our respective banks’ regulatory examinations.\nSubstantially all residential mortgage loans over \n60\n days past due are reviewed to determine loan status, collection strategy and charge-off recommendations.\n \nCharge-offs are typically considered on residential mortgage loans once the loans are delinquent \n90\n days or more and then generally taken before the loan is \n120\n days past due.  A charge-off is taken against the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the loan amount and the amount that we estimate will ultimately be collected, based on the value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell.  We predominantly use broker price opinions for these valuations.  If a loan remains in pre-foreclosure status for more than \nnine months\n, an updated valuation is obtained to determine if further charge-offs are necessary.\nLoans to financial advisors, net\nWe offer loans to financial advisors for recruiting and retention purposes.  The decision to extend credit to a financial advisor is generally based on their ability to generate future revenues.  Loans offered are generally repaid over a \nfive\n-to-\nten year\n period, with interest recognized as earned, and are contingent upon continued affiliation with us.  These loans are not assignable by the financial advisor and may only be assigned by us to a successor in interest.  There is no fee income associated with these loans.  In the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us, any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us and generally does not continue to accrue interest.  Based upon the nature of these financing receivables, affiliation status (i.e., whether the advisor is actively affiliated with us or has terminated affiliation with us) is the primary credit risk factor within this portfolio.  We present the outstanding balance of loans to financial advisors on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, net of the allowance for credit losses.  Refer to the allowance for credit losses section that follows for additional information related to our allowance for credit losses on our loans to financial advisors.  See Note 8 for additional information on our loans to financial advisors.\nLoans to financial advisors who are actively affiliated with us are considered past due once they are 30 days or more delinquent as to the payment of contractual interest or principal.  Such loans are placed on nonaccrual status when we determine that full payment of contractual principal and interest is in doubt, or the loan is past due 180 days or more as to contractual interest or principal.  When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is written-off against interest income.  Interest is recognized using the cash method for these loans thereafter until the loan qualifies for return to accrual status.  Loans are returned to an accrual status when the loans have been brought contractually current with the original terms and have been maintained on a current basis for a reasonable period, generally six months.\nWhen we determine that it is likely a loan will not be collected in full, the loan is evaluated for a potential write down of the carrying value.  After consideration of the borrower’s ability to restructure the loan, sources of repayment, and other factors affecting the borrower’s ability to repay the debt, the portion of the loan deemed a confirmed loss, if any, is charged-off.  A charge-off is taken against the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the amortized cost and the amount we estimate will ultimately be collected.  Additional charge-offs are taken if there is an adverse change in the expected cash flows.\nAllowance for credit losses\nWe evaluate our held for investment bank loans, unfunded lending commitments, loans to financial advisors and certain other financial assets to estimate an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) over the remaining life of the financial instrument.  The remaining life of our financial assets is determined by considering contractual terms and expected prepayments, among other factors.\nWe use multiple methodologies in estimating an allowance for credit losses and our approaches may differ by the subsidiary which holds the asset, the type of financial asset and the risk characteristics within each financial asset type.  Our estimates are based on ongoing evaluations of the portfolio, the related credit risk characteristics, and the overall economic and environmental conditions affecting the financial assets.  For certain of our financial assets with collateral maintenance provisions (e.g., SBL, collateralized agreements, and margin loans), we apply the practical expedient allowed under the CECL guidance in estimating an allowance for credit losses.  We reasonably expect that borrowers (or counterparties, as applicable) will replenish the collateral as required.  As a result, we estimate zero credit losses to the extent that the fair value of the collateral equals or exceeds the related carrying value of the financial asset.  When the fair value of the collateral securing the \n103\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nfinancial asset is less than the carrying value, qualitative factors such as historical experience (adjusted for current risk characteristics and economic conditions) as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts are considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses on the unsecured portion of the financial asset.\nCredit losses are charged-off against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of the financial asset is confirmed.  Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance once received.  A credit loss expense, or benefit, is recorded in earnings in an amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to our estimate as of the end of each reporting period.  Our provision or benefit for credit losses for outstanding bank loans is included in “Bank loan provision/(benefit) for credit losses” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and our provision or benefit for credit losses for all other financing receivables, including loans to financial advisors, and unfunded lending commitments, is included in “Other” expense.\nLoans\nWe generally estimate the allowance for credit losses on our loan portfolios using credit risk models which incorporate relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.  After testing the reasonableness of a variety of economic forecast scenarios, each model is run using a single forecast scenario selected for such model.  Our forecasts incorporate assumptions related to macroeconomic indicators including, but not limited to, U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”), equity market indices, unemployment rates, and commercial real estate and residential home price indices.  At the conclusion of our reasonable and supportable forecast period, which currently ranges from two to four years depending on the model and macroeconomic variables, we generally use a straight-line reversion approach over a one-year period, where applicable, to revert to historical loss information for C&I, REIT, and tax-exempt loans.  For CRE and residential mortgage loans, we incorporate a reasonable and supportable forecast of various macroeconomic variables over the remaining life of the assets including an assumption that each macroeconomic variable will revert to a long-term expectation starting in years two to four of the forecast and largely completing within the first five years of the forecast.  We assess the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and the reversion period, our reversion approach, our economic forecasts and our methodology for estimating the historical loss information on a quarterly basis.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans is generally evaluated and measured on a collective basis, based on the subsidiary which holds the asset, and then typically by loan portfolio segment, due to similar risk characteristics.  When a loan does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans, the loan is evaluated for credit losses on an individual basis.  Various risk characteristics are considered when determining whether the loan should be collectively evaluated including, but not limited to, financial asset type, internal risk ratings, collateral type, industry of the borrower, and historical or expected credit loss patterns.\nThe allowance for credit losses on collectively evaluated loans for each respective subsidiary is comprised of two components: (a) a quantitative allowance; and (b) a qualitative allowance, which is based on an analysis of model limitations and other factors not considered by the quantitative models.  There are several factors considered in estimating the quantitative allowance for credit losses on collectively evaluated loans which generally include, but are not limited to, the internal risk rating, historical loss experience (including adjustments due to current risk characteristics and economic conditions), prepayments, borrower-controlled extensions, and expected recoveries.  We use third-party data for historical information on collectively evaluated corporate loans and residential mortgage loans.\nThe qualitative portion of our allowance for credit losses includes certain factors that are not incorporated into the quantitative estimate and would generally require adjustments to the allowance for credit losses.  These qualitative factors are intended to address developing trends related to each portfolio segment and would generally include, but are not limited to: changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection; our loan review process; volume and severity of delinquent loans; changes in the seasoning of the loan portfolio and the nature, volume and terms of loans; loan diversification and credit concentrations; changes in the value of underlying collateral; changes in legal and regulatory environments; local, regional, national and international economic conditions, or recent catastrophic events not already reflected in the quantitative estimate; and the routine time delay between when economic data is gathered, analyzed and distributed by our service providers and current macroeconomic developments.\n104\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nHeld for investment bank loans\nRaymond James Bank:\n The allowance for credit losses for the C&I, CRE, REIT, residential mortgage, and tax-exempt portfolio segments is estimated using credit risk models that project a probability of default (“PD”), which is then multiplied by the loss given default (“LGD”) and the estimated exposure at default (“EAD”) at the loan-level for every period remaining in the loan’s expected life, including the maturity period.  Historical information, combined with macroeconomic variables, are used in estimating the PD, LGD and EAD.  Our credit risk models consider several factors when estimating the expected credit losses which may include, but are not limited to, financial performance and position, estimated prepayments, geographic location, industry or sector type, debt type, loan size, capital structure, initial risk levels and the economic outlook.  Additional factors considered by the residential mortgage model include FICO scores and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios.  \nTriState Capital Bank:\n The allowance for credit losses utilizes a lifetime or cumulative loss rate methodology, which identifies macroeconomic factors and asset-specific characteristics correlated with credit loss experience including loan age, loan type, and leverage.  The lifetime loss rate is applied to the amortized cost of the loan and builds on default and recovery probabilities by utilizing pool-specific historical loss rates.  These pool-specific historical loss rates may be adjusted for forecasted macroeconomic variables and other factors such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, or when historical asset terms do not reflect the contractual terms of the financial assets.  Each quarter, the relevancy of historical loss information is assessed and management considers any necessary adjustments.  Loss rates are based on historical averages for each loan pool, adjusted to reflect the impact of a single, forward-looking forecast of certain macroeconomic variables, including GDP, unemployment rates, corporate bond credit spreads, and commercial property values, which management considers to be both reasonable and supportable.     \nSee Note 7 for additional information about our bank loans, including credit quality indicators considered in developing the allowance for credit losses.\nUnfunded lending commitments\nWe estimate credit losses on unfunded lending commitments using a methodology consistent with that used in the corresponding bank loan portfolio segment and also based on the expected funding probabilities for fully binding commitments.  As a result, the allowance for credit losses for unfunded lending commitments will vary depending upon the mix of lending commitments and future funding expectations.  All classes of individually evaluated unfunded lending commitments are analyzed in conjunction with the specific allowance process previously described.\nLoans to financial advisors\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans to financial advisors is estimated using credit risk models that incorporate average annual loan-level loss rates and estimated prepayments based on historical data.  The qualitative component of our estimate considers internal and external factors that are not incorporated into the quantitative estimate such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period.  In estimating an allowance for credit losses on our individually-evaluated loans to financial advisors, we generally take into account the affiliation status of the financial advisor (i.e., whether the advisor is actively affiliated with us or has terminated affiliation with us), the borrower’s ability to restructure the loan, sources of repayment, and other factors affecting the borrower’s ability to repay the debt.\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nCredit losses on available-for-sale securities are limited to the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value on the reporting date.  Credit losses, if any, are recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct reduction in amortized cost basis or the acquisition date fair value, as applicable.  We expect zero credit losses on the portion of our available-for-sale securities portfolio that is comprised of U.S. government and government agency-backed securities and the related accrued interest receivable for which payments of both principal and interest are guaranteed, and for which we have not historically experienced any credit losses.  Unrealized losses related to these available-for-sale securities are generally due to changes in market interest rates, and we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery of the amortized cost basis.  On a quarterly basis, we reassess our expectation of zero credit losses on such securities, giving consideration to any relevant changes in the securities or the issuer.  \nOn a quarterly basis, we also evaluate non-agency-backed available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position for expected credit losses.  We first determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sell the impaired securities, giving consideration to current and forecasted liquidity requirements, regulatory and capital requirements, and our securities portfolio management.  If it is more likely than not that we will sell an available-for-sale security with a fair value below amortized cost \n105\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nbefore recovery, the security’s book basis is written down to fair value through earnings.  For available-for-sale debt securities that it is more likely than not that we will not sell before recovery, a provision for credit losses is recorded through earnings for the amount of the valuation decline below book basis that is attributable to credit losses.  We consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, credit ratings and other factors related to the security in assessing whether a credit loss exists, and we measure the credit loss by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the book basis of the security limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the book basis.  The remaining difference between the security’s fair value and its book basis (that is, the decline in fair value not attributable to credit losses) is recognized in OCI on an after-tax basis.  Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provisions for credit losses.  Losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the security is uncollectible or we intend to sell the security.  At September 30, 2025, based on our assessment of those securities not guaranteed by the U.S government or its agencies, we did not recognize an allowance for credit losses.\nIdentifiable intangible assets, net\nCertain identifiable intangible assets we acquire such as those related to customer relationships, core deposits, developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis and are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable.  Amortization expense and impairment losses, if any, related to our identifiable intangible assets are included in “Other” expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. \nWe also hold indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets, which are not amortized.  Rather, these assets are subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis to determine whether the estimated fair value is in excess of its carrying value, or between annual impairment evaluation dates, if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment.  In the course of our evaluation of the potential impairment of such indefinite-lived assets, we may elect either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment.  If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is greater than its carrying amount, we are not required to perform a quantitative impairment analysis.  However, if we conclude otherwise, we then perform a quantitative impairment analysis.  We have elected January 1 as our annual impairment evaluation date, evaluating balances as of December 31.\n  See Note 10 for additional information regarding the outcome of our impairment assessment.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the related net assets acquired.  Indefinite lived intangible assets such as goodwill are not amortized, but rather evaluated for impairment at least annually, or between annual impairment evaluation dates whenever events or circumstances indicate potential impairment exists.  Impairment exists when the carrying value of a reporting unit, which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments, exceeds its respective fair value.\nIn the course of our evaluation of a potential impairment to goodwill, we may elect either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment.  Our qualitative assessments consider macroeconomic indicators, such as trends in equity and fixed income markets, GDP, labor markets, interest rates, and housing markets.  We also consider regulatory changes, as well as company-specific factors such as market capitalization, reporting unit specific results, and changes in key personnel and strategy.  Changes in these indicators, and our ability to respond to such changes, may trigger the need for impairment testing at a point other than our annual assessment date.  We assess these, and other, qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative impairment analysis is not required.  However, if we conclude otherwise, we then perform a quantitative impairment analysis.  Alternatively, if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative evaluation.\nIn the event of a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit with which the goodwill is associated and compare it to the carrying value.  We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about future operating results and cash flows and, if appropriate, a market approach.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess.\nWe have elected January 1 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date, evaluating balances as of December 31.\n  See Note 10 for additional information regarding the outcome of our goodwill impairment assessments.\n106\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nOther assets\nOther assets is primarily comprised of investments in corporate-owned life insurance, property and equipment, net, ROU lease assets, prepaid expenses, investments in FHLB and FRB stock, investments in real estate partnerships held by consolidated VIEs, and certain other investments which are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis.  See Note 11 for additional information.  Other assets also includes client-owned fractional shares for which we act in a principal capacity.  See our client-owned fractional shares policy above for additional information. \nWe maintain investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies primarily utilized to indirectly fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. These life insurance policies are recorded at cash surrender value as determined by the insurer.  See Note 22 for information on the non-qualified deferred compensation plans.  \nOwnership of FHLB and FRB stock is a requirement for all banks seeking membership into and access to the services provided by these banking systems.  These investments are carried at cost. \nRaymond James Affordable Housing Investments, Inc. (“RJAHI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RJF, or one of its affiliates, acts as the managing member or general partner in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) funds and other funds of a similar nature, some of which require consolidation.  These funds invest in housing project limited partnerships or limited liability companies (“LLCs”) which purchase and develop affordable housing properties generally qualifying for federal and state low-income housing tax credits and/or provide a mechanism for banks and other institutions to meet certain regulatory obligations.  The investments in project partnerships of all of the LIHTC and other fund VIEs which require consolidation are included in “Other assets” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nOur Bank segment holds investments which deliver tax benefits, including in LIHTC funds, some of which are managed by RJAHI.  We also hold other investments in tax credit structures.  These investments are included in “Other assets” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\n  See the “Income taxes” section of this Note 2 for a discussion of our accounting for investments which qualify for tax credits.  See additional discussion in this Note 2 regarding our evaluation and conclusions around consolidation of such VIEs.\nProperty and equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and software amortization.  Property and equipment primarily consists of software, buildings, certain leasehold improvements, and furniture.  Software includes both purchased software and internally developed software that has been placed in service, as well as certain software projects where development is in progress.  Buildings primarily consists of owned facilities.  Leasehold improvements are generally costs associated with lessee-owned interior office space improvements.  Equipment primarily consists of communications and technology hardware.  \nDepreciation of assets (other than land, which is not depreciated) is primarily calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally within ranges outlined in the following table.\nAsset type\nEstimated useful life\nBuildings, building components and land improvements\n15\n to \n40\n years\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n3\n to \n10\n years\nSoftware\n2\n to \n10\n years\nLeasehold improvements (lessee-owned)\nLesser of useful life or lease term\nCosts for significant internally developed software projects are capitalized when the costs relate to development of new applications or modification of existing internal-use software that results in additional functionality.  Internally developed software project costs related to preliminary-project and post-project activities are expensed as incurred.  \nAdditions, improvements and expenditures that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance, as well as all maintenance costs associated with software applications, are expensed in the period incurred.  Depreciation expense associated with property and equipment is included in “Occupancy and equipment” expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  Amortization expense associated with computer software is included in “Communications and information processing” expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  Gains and losses on disposals of property and equipment are included in “Other” revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period of disposal.\n  See Note 12 for additional information regarding our property and equipment.\n107\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nLeases\nWe have operating leases for the premises we occupy in many of our U.S. and foreign locations, including our employee-based branch office operations.  At inception, we determine if an arrangement to utilize a building or piece of equipment is a lease and, if so, the appropriate lease classification.  Substantially all of our leases are operating leases.  If the arrangement is determined to be a lease, we recognize a ROU lease asset in “Other assets” and a corresponding lease liability in “Other payables” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  ROU lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.  We elected the practical expedient, where leases with an initial or acquired term of 12 months or less are not recorded as a ROU lease asset or lease liability.  Our lease terms include any noncancelable periods and may reflect periods covered by options to extend or terminate when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options.\nWe record our ROU lease assets at the amount of the lease liability plus any prepaid rent, amounts paid for lessor-owned leasehold improvements, and initial direct costs, less any lease incentives and accrued rent.  We record lease liabilities at commencement date (or acquisition date, for leases assumed through acquisitions) based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, which is discounted using our commencement date or acquisition date incremental borrowing rate, or at the imputed rate within the lease, as appropriate.  Our incremental borrowing rate considers the weighted-average yields on our senior notes payable, adjusted for collateralization and tenor.  Payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, such as operating expense payments under a real estate lease, are considered variable and are expensed in the period incurred.  For our real estate leases, we elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease.  Lease expense for our lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term if the ROU lease asset has not been impaired or abandoned. \n See Note 13 for additional information on our leases.\nBank deposits\nBank deposits include money market accounts, savings accounts, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing demand deposits, and certificates of deposit held at our Bank segment.  Bank deposits include deposits that are swept from the investment accounts of PCG clients through the RJBDP which are primarily included in money market and savings accounts, as well as deposits associated with our Enhanced Savings Program (“ESP”), which are primarily included within interest-bearing demand deposits, and certificates of deposit.  Deposits are stated at the principal amount outstanding.  Interest on deposits is accrued and charged to interest expense daily and is paid or credited in accordance with the terms of the respective accounts.  The interest rates on the vast majority of our deposits are determined based on market rates and, in certain cases, may be linked to an index, such as the effective federal funds rate.\n  See Note 14 for additional detail regarding deposits. \nContingent liabilities\nWe recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  Whether a loss is probable, and if so, the estimated range of possible loss, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and uncertainties.  When a loss is probable and a range of possible loss can be estimated, we accrue the most likely amount within that range; if the most likely amount of possible loss within that range is not determinable, the minimum amount in the range of loss is accrued.  No liability is recognized for those matters which, in management’s judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of loss is not possible, or for which a loss is not determined to be probable.\nWe record liabilities related to legal and regulatory matters in “Other payables” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  The determination of these liability amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management.  Management considers many factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss experienced by the client; the basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees or financial advisors; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law.  Each legal and regulatory matter is reviewed in each accounting period and the liability balance is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management.  Any change in the liability amount is recorded through “Other” expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  The actual costs of resolving legal or regulatory matters may be substantially higher or lower than the recorded liability amounts for such matters.  Our costs of defense related to such matters are expensed in the period they are incurred.  Such defense costs are primarily related to external legal fees which are included within “Professional fees” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\n  See Note 18 for additional information.\n108\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nShare-based compensation\nWe account for the compensation cost related to share-based payment awards made to employees, directors, and independent contractors based on the estimated fair values of the awards on the date of grant.  The compensation cost of our share-based awards, net of estimated forfeitures, is amortized over the requisite service period of the awards.  For share-based payment awards with performance conditions, we estimate the expected level of achievement of the award and recognize the compensation cost based on the level of achievement deemed probable.  Changes in the estimated outcome of our share-based awards with a performance condition are reflected as a cumulative adjustment to expense in the period of the change in estimate.  Share-based compensation amortization is included in “Compensation, commissions and benefits” expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\n  See Note 22 for additional information on our share-based compensation.\nDeferred compensation plans\nWe maintain various deferred compensation plans for the benefit of certain employees and independent contractors that provide a return to the participant based upon the performance of various referenced investments.  For the Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan (“VDCP”), Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), and certain other plans, we purchase and hold corporate-owned life insurance policies on the lives of certain current and former participants to provide a source of funds available to satisfy our obligations under the plan.  See Note 11 for information regarding the carrying value of such policies.  Compensation expense is recognized for all awards made under such plans with future service requirements over the requisite service period using the straight-line method.  Changes in the value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies, as well as the expenses associated with the related deferred compensation plans, are recorded in “Compensation, commissions and benefits” expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\n  See Note 22 for additional information.\nForeign currency translation\nThe statements of financial condition of the foreign subsidiaries we consolidate are translated at exchange rates as of the period-end.  The statements of income are translated either at an average exchange rate for the period or, in certain cases, at the exchange rate in effect on the date which transactions occur.  The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollar (“USD”) are included in OCI and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of AOCI.  Gains and losses relating to transactions in currencies other than the respective subsidiaries’ functional currency are reported in “Other” revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nIncome taxes\nThe objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year.  We utilize the asset and liability method to provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements.  This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes.  Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized.  Our net deferred tax assets and net deferred tax liabilities presented on the financial statements are based upon the jurisdictional footprint of the firm.  We consider our major jurisdictions for disclosure purposes to be federal, state, Canada, and the UK.  Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, including the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  See Note 17 for additional information on our income taxes.\nWe hold equity investments in certain structures which deliver tax benefits, including LIHTC funds, historic tax credit (“HTC”) funds, and renewable energy tax credit investments.  For those LIHTC, HTC, and renewable energy tax credit equity investments that qualify for the application of the proportional amortization method, we apply such method.  Under the proportional amortization method, such investment is amortized in proportion to the allocation of tax benefits received in each year, and the investment amortization and the tax benefits are presented on a net basis within “Provision for income taxes” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  The income tax credits and other income tax benefits received related to such investments are included in “Cash flows from operating activities” on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nWhen our tax credit equity investments do not qualify for the proportional amortization method, we record the investment amortization, through the application of the equity method of accounting, in “Other” expenses on our Consolidated Statements \n109\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nof Income and Comprehensive Income and the federal tax credits that result from such investments are recorded using the flow-through method where the benefits reduce our provision for income taxes in the year the tax credits are earned.  As a result, inclusion of these tax credits may not align to the year in which we amortize the related investments.  Other income or losses generated from such investments are generally included in “Other” income or “Other” expenses, respectively, on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and in “\nCash flows from operations\n” on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nEarnings per share (“EPS”)\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding.  Earnings attributable to common shareholders represents net income reduced by preferred stock dividends as well as the allocation of earnings and dividends to participating securities.  Diluted EPS is calculated similarly to basic EPS adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards, primarily certain restricted stock units (“RSUs”), by application of the treasury stock method.\nEvaluation of VIEs to determine whether consolidation is required\nA VIE requires consolidation by the entity’s primary beneficiary.  Examples of entities that may be VIEs include certain legal entities structured as corporations, partnerships or LLCs.\nWe evaluate all of the entities in which we are involved to determine if the entity is a VIE and if so, whether we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary.  We hold variable interests primarily in the following VIEs: certain private equity investments, a trust fund established for employee retention purposes (“Restricted Stock Trust Fund”), certain LIHTC funds or funds of a similar nature, and certain other investment structures for which we receive tax credits.  See Note 9 for additional information on our VIEs.\nDetermination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE\nWe consolidate VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.  The process for determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE is to conclude whether we are a party to the VIE holding a variable interest that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE, and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur determination of the primary beneficiary of each entity in which an RJF subsidiary has a variable interest requires judgment and is based on an analysis of all relevant facts and circumstances, including: (1) an assessment of the characteristics of the variable interest and other involvement the subsidiary has with the entity, including involvement of related parties and any de facto agents, as well as the involvement of other variable interest holders, namely, limited partners or investor members, and (2) the entity’s purpose and design, including the risks that the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders.  \nLIHTC funds\nRJAHI is the managing member or general partner in a number of LIHTC funds having \none\n or more investor members or limited partners.  These LIHTC funds are organized as LLCs or limited partnerships for the purpose of investing in a number of project partnerships, which are limited partnerships or LLCs that purchase and develop, or hold, low-income housing properties qualifying for tax credits and/or provide a mechanism for banks and other institutions to meet their Community Reinvestment Act obligations throughout the U.S.\nIn the design of most tax credit fund VIEs, the investor members invest solely for tax attributes associated with the portfolio of low-income housing properties held by the fund.  However, certain fund VIEs which invest and hold project partnerships that have already delivered most of the tax credits to their investors hold the projects to monetize anticipated future tax benefits for which the project may ultimately qualify.  In both instances, RJAHI, as the managing member or general partner of the fund, is responsible for overseeing the fund’s operations.\nRJAHI sponsors \ntwo\n general types of tax credit funds designed to deliver tax benefits to the investors.  Generally, neither type meets the VIE consolidation criteria.  These types of funds include single investor funds and multi-investor funds.  RJAHI does not typically provide guarantees related to the delivery or funding of tax credits or other tax attributes to the investor members or limited partners of tax credit funds.  The investor member(s) or limited partner(s) of the VIEs bear the risk of loss on their \n110\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\ninvestment.  Additionally, under the tax credit fund’s designed structure, the investor member(s) or limited partner(s) receive nearly all of the tax credits and tax-deductible loss benefits designed to be delivered by the fund entity, as well as a majority of any proceeds upon a sale of a project partnership held by a tax credit fund (fund level residuals).  RJAHI earns fees from the fund for its services in organizing the fund, identifying and acquiring the project partnership investments and ongoing asset management, and receives a share of any residuals arising from sale of project partnerships upon the termination of the fund.  Such fees are recorded in “Other” revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  \nIn single investor funds that deliver tax benefits, RJAHI has concluded that the \none\n single investor member or limited partner in such funds, in nearly all instances, has significant participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund.  Therefore RJAHI, as managing member or general partner of such funds, is not the \none\n party with power over such activities and resultantly is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of such single investor funds and, in nearly all cases, these funds are not consolidated.\nIn multi-investor funds that deliver tax benefits, RJAHI has concluded that since the participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund are not held by one single investor member or limited partner, RJAHI is deemed to have the power over such activities.  RJAHI then assesses whether its projected benefits to be received from the multi-investor funds, primarily its share of any residuals upon the termination of the fund, are potentially significant to the fund.  As such residuals received upon termination are not expected to be significant to the funds, in nearly all cases, these funds are not consolidated.\nRJAHI may also sponsor other funds designed to hold projects to monetize future tax benefits for which the projects may qualify in either single investor or multi-investor form.  In single investor form, the limited partner has significant participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund, and therefore RJAHI is not the primary beneficiary of such funds and such funds are not consolidated.  In multi-investor form, we have concluded that we meet the power criteria since participating rights are not held by any one single investor and thus RJAHI is deemed to have the power over such activities; however, we have concluded that we do not meet the benefits criteria given we do not expect the benefits to be potentially significant and therefore we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not consolidate the funds.  \nDirect investments in LIHTC project partnerships\nRaymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank are the investor members of LIHTC funds that deliver tax benefits which we have determined to be VIEs, and in which RJAHI, or its subsidiary, is the managing member.  For Raymond James Bank, we have determined that it is the primary beneficiary of one such VIE and therefore, we consolidate the fund.  TriState Capital Bank also holds investments in other LIHTC funds for which we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary.  LIHTC funds which we consolidate are investor members in certain LIHTC project partnerships.  Since unrelated third parties are the managing members of the investee project partnerships, we have determined that consolidation of these project partnerships is not required and the funds account for their project partnership investments under the equity method.  These investments are included in “Other assets” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  See Note 18 for information regarding our commitments to these investments.\nPrivate Equity Interests\nAs part of our private equity investments, we hold investments in certain third-party partnerships (our “Private Equity Interests”).  We evaluated the characteristics of these Private Equity Interests and concluded that they are VIEs.  In our analysis of the criteria to determine whether we were the primary beneficiary of the Private Equity Interests VIEs, we analyzed the power and benefits criteria.  We have determined we are a passive limited partner investor, and thus, we do not have the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of such VIEs.  Accordingly, in such circumstances, we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore we do not consolidate these VIEs.\nRestricted Stock Trust Fund\nWe utilize a trust in connection with certain of our RSU awards.  This trust fund was established and funded for the purpose of acquiring our common stock in the open market to be used to settle RSUs granted as a retention vehicle for certain employees of our Canadian subsidiaries.  We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, consolidate this trust fund.\n111\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nAcquisitions\nOur financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses starting from the completion of the acquisition.  Acquisitions are generally recorded as business combinations, whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, including any identifiable intangible assets.  Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities.  The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward-looking views of our businesses, client behavior, and market conditions.  We consider the income, market and cost approaches and place reliance on the approach or approaches deemed most appropriate to estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets.  Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability) and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. \nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.  With the exception of certain customer relationships, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements) are expected to have determinable useful lives.  We estimate the useful lives of these intangible assets based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying demand, and operating plans.  Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life.\n  Refer to Note 10 and our goodwill and intangible assets policies above for additional information.\n \n112\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

These financial instruments generally expose us to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market rates.  Under the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents, including amounts segregated for regulatory purposes and restricted cash, are classified as Level 1 and collateralized agreements and financings are classified as Level 2.\nBank loans, net:\n These financial instruments are primarily comprised of loans originated or purchased by our Bank segment and include SBL, C&I loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, REIT loans, and tax-exempt loans intended to be held until maturity or payoff.  These financial instruments are primarily recorded at amounts that result from the application of the accounting methodologies for loans held for investment summarized in Note 2.  Certain bank loans are held for sale, which are carried at the lower of cost or market value.  A portion of these loans held for sale, as well as certain held for investment loans which have been written-down, are recorded at fair value as nonrecurring fair value measurements and therefore are excluded from the preceding table.\nThe fair values for both variable and fixed-rate loans held for investment are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality, which includes our estimate of future credit losses expected to be incurred.  The majority of these loans are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.  Refer to Note 2 for information regarding the fair value policies specific to loans held for sale.\nReceivables and other assets:\n Brokerage client receivables, other receivables, and certain other assets are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value and are classified as Levels 2 and 3 under the fair value hierarchy.  As specified under GAAP, the FHLB and FRB stock are recorded at cost, which we have determined to approximate their estimated fair value, and are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.\nLoans to financial advisors, net:\n These financial instruments are primarily comprised of loans to financial advisors, primarily offered for recruiting and retention purposes.  Loans to financial advisors, net are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value and are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.  Refer to Note 2 for information regarding loans to financial advisors, net.\n117\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nBank deposits:\n The fair values for demand deposits are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts).  The carrying amounts of money market and savings accounts approximate their fair values as substantially all of these deposits are variable-rate accounts and short-term in nature. Demand deposits and money market and savings accounts are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current interest rates based on the remaining term of the deposit.  Fixed-rate certificates of deposit were classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.\nPayables:\n Brokerage client payables, accrued compensation, commissions and benefits, and other payables are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value and are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.\nOther borrowings:\n Other borrowings primarily included our Bank segment’s borrowings from the FHLB and, as of September\n \n30, 2024, our \n5.75\n% fixed-to-floating subordinated notes due 2030, which were redeemed on August 15, 2025.  FHLB advances generally reflect terms that approximate current market rates for similar loans and therefore, their carrying value approximates fair value.  Our FHLB advances were classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of the subordinated notes as of September 30, 2024 was estimated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using market rates for borrowings of similar maturities and was classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.  \nSenior notes payable:\n  The fair value of our senior notes payable is calculated based upon recent trades of those debt securities in the market.  Our senior notes payable are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.\nNOTE 4 – \nAVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES\nThe following table details the amortized costs and fair values of our available-for-sale securities.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nThe following table details the contractual maturities, amortized costs, fair values and current yields for our available-for-sale securities.  Weighted-average yields are calculated on a taxable-equivalent basis based on estimated annual income divided by the average amortized cost of these securities.  Since our MBS and CMO available-for-sale securities are backed by mortgages, actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.  As a result, the weighted-average life of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments, was approximately \n3.8\n years as of September 30, 2025.\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\n$ in millions\nWithin one year\nAfter one but \nwithin five years\nAfter five but \nwithin ten years\nAfter ten years\nTotal\nAgency residential MBS\n \n \n \n \n \nAmortized cost\n$\n1\n \n$\n208\n \n$\n1,581\n \n$\n1,741\n \n$\n3,531\n \nFair value\n$\n1\n \n$\n198\n \n$\n1,470\n \n$\n1,600\n \n$\n3,269\n \nWeighted-average yield\n2.00\n \n%\n1.44\n \n%\n1.32\n \n%\n2.45\n \n%\n1.88\n \n%\nAgency commercial MBS\nAmortized cost\n$\n223\n \n$\n816\n \n$\n138\n \n$\n46\n \n$\n1,223\n \nFair value\n$\n219\n \n$\n760\n \n$\n121\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n1,138\n \nWeighted-average yield\n1.59\n \n%\n1.35\n \n%\n1.27\n \n%\n1.85\n \n%\n1.40\n \n%\nAgency CMOs\nAmortized cost\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n33\n \n$\n1,388\n \n$\n1,421\n \nFair value\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n30\n \n$\n1,247\n \n$\n1,277\n \nWeighted-average yield\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n1.35\n \n%\n2.34\n \n%\n2.31\n \n%\nU.S. Treasuries\nAmortized cost\n$\n233\n \n$\n196\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n429\n \nFair value\n$\n233\n \n$\n197\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n430\n \nWeighted-average yield\n4.11\n \n%\n4.11\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n4.11\n \n%\nOther agency obligations\nAmortized cost\n$\n88\n \n$\n104\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n229\n \nFair value\n$\n88\n \n$\n103\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n227\n \nWeighted-average yield\n2.80\n \n%\n3.63\n \n%\n2.42\n \n%\n3.07\n \n%\n3.14\n \n%\nNon-agency residential MBS\nAmortized cost\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n484\n \n$\n484\n \nFair value\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n453\n \n$\n453\n \nWeighted-average yield\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n4.14\n \n%\n4.14\n \n%\nCorporate bonds\nAmortized cost\n$\n9\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n79\n \nFair value\n$\n10\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n79\n \nWeighted-average yield\n5.63\n \n%\n5.09\n \n%\n5.02\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n5.14\n \n%\nOther\nAmortized cost\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n14\n \nFair value\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n15\n \nWeighted-average yield\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n6.97\n \n%\n6.81\n \n%\n6.86\n \n%\nTotal available-for-sale securities\nAmortized cost\n$\n554\n \n$\n1,371\n \n$\n1,808\n \n$\n3,677\n \n$\n7,410\n \nFair value\n$\n551\n \n$\n1,305\n \n$\n1,676\n \n$\n3,356\n \n$\n6,888\n \nWeighted-average yield\n2.91\n \n%\n2.06\n \n%\n1.39\n \n%\n2.64\n \n%\n2.25\n \n%\n119\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

Where we are subject to credit exposure, we perform a credit evaluation of counterparties prior to entering into derivative transactions and we continue to monitor their credit standings on an ongoing basis.  We may require initial margin or collateral from counterparties, generally in the form of cash or marketable securities to support certain of these obligations as established by the credit threshold specified by the agreement and/or as a result of monitoring the credit standing of the counterparties. We also enter into derivatives with clients, typically interest rate derivatives, to which either of our bank subsidiaries have provided loans.  Such derivatives are generally collateralized by marketable securities or other assets of the client.\nInterest rate and foreign exchange risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to certain of our interest rate derivatives.  We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk related to our forward foreign exchange derivatives.  On a daily basis, we monitor our risk exposure on our derivatives based on established sensitivity-based and foreign exchange spot limits.\nDerivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features\nCertain of our derivative contracts contain provisions that require our debt to maintain an investment-grade rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies or contain provisions related to default on certain of our outstanding debt.  If our debt were to fall below investment-grade or we were to default on certain of our outstanding debt, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could terminate the derivative and request immediate payment, or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions.  The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was not significant at either September 30, 2025 or 2024.\n122\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nCredit quality indicators\nThe credit quality of our bank loan portfolio is summarized monthly by management using internal risk ratings, which align with the standard asset classification system utilized by bank regulators.  These classifications are divided into three groups: Not Classified (Pass), Special Mention, and Classified or Adverse Rating (Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss).  These terms are defined as follows:\nPass\n – Loans which are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less costs to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral and generally are performing in accordance with the contractual terms.\nSpecial Mention\n – Loans which have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention.  These loans are not adversely classified and do not expose us to sufficient risk to warrant an adverse classification.\nSubstandard\n – Loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans with this classification are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful\n – Loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently-known facts, conditions and values.\nLoss\n – Loans which are considered by management to be uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance on our books as an asset, without establishment of a specific valuation allowance or charge-off, is not warranted.  We do not have any loan balances within this classification because, in accordance with our accounting policy, loans, or a portion thereof considered to be uncollectible are charged-off prior to the assignment of this classification.\n127\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

The interest rates on our floating-rate advances are based on a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and reset daily.  We use interest rate swaps to manage the risk of increases in interest rates associated with our floating-rate FHLB advances by converting the balances subject to variable interest rates to a fixed interest rate.  See Notes 2 and 5 for information regarding these interest rate swaps, which have been designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.  See Note 6 for additional information regarding bank loans and available-for-sale securities pledged with the FHLB as security for our FHLB borrowings. \n \nSubordinated notes\nOur subordinated notes due May 2030, incurred interest at a fixed rate of \n5.75\n% until May 15, 2025 and thereafter at a variable interest rate equal to 3-month CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a spread adjustment of \n5.62\n% per annum.

The subordinated notes were redeemed at their principal amount of $\n98\n million, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the redemption date utilizing cash on hand.  \nCredit Facility\nRJF and RJ&A are parties to a revolving credit facility agreement (the “Credit Facility”), a committed unsecured line of credit under which both RJ&A and RJF have the ability to borrow.  In September 2025, we amended the Credit Facility, extending the term to September 2030, increasing the borrowing capacity to $\n1\n billion from $\n750\n million, and incorporating a lower cost of borrowing under the Credit Facility.  The interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility are variable and based on SOFR, as adjusted for RJF’s credit rating.  There were \nno\n borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2025 or September 30, 2024.  There is a facility fee associated with the Credit Facility, which also varies with RJF’s credit rating (the “Variable Rate Facility Fee”).  Based upon RJF’s credit rating as of September 30, 2025, the Variable Rate Facility Fee, which is applied to the committed amount, was \n0.125\n% per annum. \nOther\nIn addition to the Credit Facility, we maintain various secured and unsecured lines of credit, which are generally utilized to finance certain fixed income trading instruments or for cash management purposes.  Borrowings during the year were generally day-to-day and there were \nno\n borrowings outstanding on these arrangements as of September 30, 2025 or September 30, 2024.  The interest rates for these arrangements are variable and are based on a daily bank quoted rate, which may reference SOFR, the federal funds rate, a lender’s prime rate, the Canadian prime rate, or another commercially available rate, as applicable.\nA portion of our fixed income transactions are cleared through a third-party clearing organization, which provides financing for the purchase of trading instruments to support such transactions.  The amount of financing is based on the amount of trading inventory financed, as well as any deposits held at the clearing organization.

We continue to believe that the realization of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on expectations of future taxable income.    \n143\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were $\n4\n million of net deferred tax liabilities included in “Other payables” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, which primarily arose from entities in the UK, and accordingly were not netted against balances arising from our U.S. entities.    \nAs of September 30, 2025, we considered substantially all undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested and have not provided for any U.S. deferred income taxes related to such subsidiaries as we expect our incremental tax cost of repatriating such offshore earnings to not be significant.  As of September 30, 2025, we had approximately $\n669\n million of cumulative undistributed earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries.  Because the time and manner of repatriation is uncertain, we cannot determine the impact of local taxes, withholding taxes, and foreign tax credits associated with the future repatriation of such earnings, and therefore cannot quantify the tax liability that would be payable in the event all such foreign earnings are repatriated.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the current tax receivable, which was included in “Other receivables, net” on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, was $\n79\n million, and the current tax payable, which was included in “Other payables,” was $\n5\n million.  As of September 30, 2024, the current tax receivable was $\n28\n million, and there was \nno\n current tax payable.\nUncertain tax positions\nWe recognize the accrual of interest and penalties related to income tax matters in “Interest expense” and “Other” expense, respectively.  As of September 30, 2025 and 2024, accrued interest and penalties were $\n9\n million and $\n14\n million, respectively.\nThe following table presents the aggregate changes in the balances for uncertain tax positions.\nYear ended September 30,\n$ in millions\n2025\n2024\n2023\nUncertain tax positions beginning of year\n$\n48\n \n$\n41\n \n$\n43\n \nIncreases for tax positions related to the current year\n15\n \n6\n \n5\n \nIncreases for tax positions related to prior years\n \n6\n \n9\n \n4\n \nDecreases for tax positions related to prior years\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nDecreases due to statute of limitations expirations\n(\n16\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n8\n)\nDecreases related to settlements\n(\n6\n)\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nUncertain tax positions end of year\n$\n47\n \n$\n48\n \n$\n41\n \nThe total amount of uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate (the items included in the preceding table after considering the federal tax benefit associated with any state tax provisions) was $\n41\n million at both September 30, 2025 and 2024, and $\n35\n million at September 30, 2023.  We anticipate that the uncertain tax position liability balance will decrease by approximately $\n11\n million over the next 12 months due to expiration of statutes of limitations of federal and state tax returns.\nRJF and its domestic subsidiaries are included in the consolidated income tax returns of RJF in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various consolidated states.  Our subsidiaries also file separate income tax returns in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.  We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2022.  With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for foreign jurisdictions for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2022 and state and local jurisdictions for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2021.  Certain state and local and foreign tax returns are currently under various stages of audit and appeals processes.\n \n144\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nNOTE 18 – \nCOMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES\nCommitments and contingencies\nUnderwriting commitments\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into commitments for debt and equity underwritings.  As of September 30, 2025, we had \nfour\n such open underwriting commitments, which were subsequently settled in open market transactions and did not result in any losses.\nLending commitments and other credit-related financial instruments\nWe have outstanding, at any time, a significant number of commitments to extend credit and other credit-related off-balance-sheet financial instruments, such as standby letters of credit and loan purchases, which extend over varying periods of time.  These arrangements are subject to strict underwriting assessments and each client’s credit worthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Fixed-rate commitments are subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and our exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments.\nThe following table presents our commitments to extend credit and other credit-related off-balance sheet financial instruments outstanding at our Bank segment.\nSeptember 30,\n$ in millions\n2025\n2024\nSBL and other consumer lines of credit\n$\n56,048\n \n$\n44,057\n \nCommercial lines of credit\n$\n5,441\n \n$\n4,630\n \nUnfunded lending commitments\n$\n716\n \n$\n640\n \nStandby letters of credit\n$\n217\n \n$\n111\n \nSBL and other consumer lines of credit primarily represent the unfunded amounts of bank loans to consumers that are primarily secured by marketable securities or other liquid collateral at advance rates consistent with industry standards.  These amounts reflect the maximum credit availability, contingent upon borrowers meeting applicable collateral posting requirements.  The proceeds from repayment or, if necessary, the liquidation of collateral, which is monitored daily, are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn against these existing lines of credit.  These lines of credit are unconditionally cancelable and we reserve the right to not make any advances or may terminate these lines at any time.\nBecause many of our lending commitments expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contractual amounts are not estimates of our actual future credit exposure or future liquidity requirements.  The allowance for credit losses calculated under the CECL model provides for potential losses related to the unfunded lending commitments.  See Notes 2 and 7 for additional information regarding this allowance for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments.\nRJ&A enters into margin lending arrangements which allow clients to borrow against the value of qualifying securities.  Such loans are extended on a demand basis and are generally not committed facilities.  Margin loans are collateralized by the securities held in the client’s account at RJ&A.  Collateral levels and established credit terms are monitored daily and we require clients to deposit additional collateral or reduce balances as necessary.\nWe offer loans to prospective financial advisors for recruiting and retention purposes (see Notes 2 and 8 for additional information regarding our loans to financial advisors).  These offers are contingent upon certain events occurring, including the individuals joining us or continuing their affiliation with us and meeting certain other conditions outlined in their offer.  We have unfunded commitments of $\n38\n million for loans to financial advisors who have met such conditions as of September 30, 2025.\nInvestment commitments\nWe had unfunded commitments to various investments, primarily held by Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank, of $\n102\n million as of September 30, 2025.\n145\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nOther commitments\nRJAHI sells investments in project partnerships to various LIHTC funds, which have third-party investors, and for which RJAHI serves as the managing member or general partner.  RJAHI typically sells investments in project partnerships to LIHTC funds within \n90\n days of their acquisition.  Until such investments are sold to LIHTC funds, RJAHI is responsible for funding investment commitments to such partnerships.  As of September 30, 2025, RJAHI had committed approximately $\n65\n million to project partnerships that had not yet been sold to LIHTC funds.  Because we expect to sell these project partnerships to LIHTC funds and the equity funding events arise over future periods, the contractual commitments are not expected to materially impact our future liquidity requirements.  RJAHI may also make short-term loans or advances to project partnerships and LIHTC funds.\nOn October 14, 2025, we announced we had reached an agreement to acquire a majority stake in GreensLedge Holdings LLC (“GreensLedge”), a boutique investment bank specializing in structured credit and securitization.  The transaction, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, is currently expected to close in our fiscal 2026.  The acquisition of GreensLedge will add securitization and advisory capabilities to our existing fixed income operations.  We currently have the ability to utilize our cash on hand to fund the acquisition.  GreensLedge will operate within our Capital Markets segment upon completion of the acquisition.  \nFor information regarding our lease commitments, including the maturities of our lease liabilities, see Note 13.\nGuarantees\nOur U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to be members of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation (“SIPC”).  The SIPC fund provides protection up to $\n500\n thousand per client for securities and cash held in client accounts, including a limitation of $\n250\n thousand on claims for cash balances.  We have purchased excess SIPC coverage through various syndicates of Lloyd’s of London.  For RJ&A, our clearing broker-dealer, the additional protection currently provided has an aggregate firm limit of $\n750\n million for cash and securities, including a sub-limit of $\n1.9\n million per client for cash above basic SIPC.  Account protection applies when a SIPC member fails financially and is unable to meet its obligations to clients.  This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations.  RJF has provided an indemnity to Lloyd’s of London against any and all losses they may incur associated with the excess SIPC policies.\nLegal and regulatory matters contingencies\nIn the normal course of our business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a diversified financial services institution.\nRJF and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regular reviews and inspections by regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”).  Reviews can result in the imposition of sanctions for regulatory violations, ranging from non-monetary censures to fines and, in serious cases, temporary or permanent suspension from conducting business, or limitations on certain business activities.  In addition, regulatory agencies and SROs institute investigations from time to time into industry practices, among other things, which can also result in the imposition of such sanctions.\nWe may contest liability and/or the amount of damages, as appropriate, in each pending matter.  The level of litigation and investigatory activity (both formal and informal) by government and self-regulatory agencies in the financial services industry continues to be significant.  There can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.\nFor many legal and regulatory matters, we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss as we cannot predict if, how or when such proceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be.  A large number of factors may contribute to this inherent unpredictability: the proceeding is in its early stages; the damages sought are unspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis; the other party is seeking relief other than or in addition to compensatory damages (including, in the case of regulatory and governmental proceedings, potential fines and penalties); the matters present significant legal uncertainties; we have not engaged in settlement discussions; discovery is not complete; there are significant facts in dispute; and numerous parties are named as defendants (including where it is uncertain how liability might be shared among defendants).  Subject to the foregoing, after consultation with counsel, we believe that the outcome of such litigation and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.  However, the outcome \n146\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nof such litigation and regulatory proceedings could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular future period, depending on, among other things, our revenues or income for such period.\nThere are certain matters for which we are unable to estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss.  With respect to legal and regulatory matters for which management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss as of September 30, 2025, the estimated upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss was approximately $\n10\n million in excess of the aggregate accruals for such matters.  See Note 2 for a discussion of our criteria for recognizing liabilities for contingencies.\nNOTE 19 – \nSHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nPreferred stock\nAs a component of our total purchase consideration for TriState Capital on June 1, 2022, we issued two series of preferred stock to replace previously issued and outstanding preferred stock of TriState Capital.  The preferred stock issuance included \n1.61\n million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of \n6.75\n% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”), par value of $\n0.10\n per share, with a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\n per share (equivalent of $\n25\n per depositary share) and \n3.22\n million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of  \n6.375\n% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”), par value of $\n0.10\n per share, with a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\n per share (equivalent of $\n25\n per depositary share).  We redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock on April 3, 2023.\nDividends on Series B Preferred Stock are non-cumulative and, if declared, payable quarterly at a rate of \n6.375\n% per annum from original issue date up to, but excluding, July 1, 2026, and thereafter at a floating rate equal to 3-month CME Term SOFR plus a spread adjustment of \n4.35\n% per annum.  Under certain circumstances, the aforementioned fixed rate may apply in lieu of the floating rate.  Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, we may redeem the Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at the liquidation preference plus declared and unpaid dividends.  \nThe following table details the shares outstanding, carrying value, and aggregate liquidation preference of our preferred stock. \n$ in millions\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeries B Preferred Stock:\nShares outstanding\n80,500\n80,500\nCarrying value\n$\n79\n \n$\n79\n \nAggregate liquidation preference\n$\n81\n \n$\n81\n \nThe following table details dividends declared and dividends paid on our Series A and Series B preferred stock for the years ended September 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023.\n \nDividends declared\nDividends paid\n$ in millions, except per share amounts\nTotal dividends\nPer preferred\nshare amount\nTotal dividends\nPer preferred\nshare amount\nYear ended September 30, 2025\nSeries B Preferred Stock \n$\n5\n \n$\n63.76\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n63.76\n \nYear ended September 30, 2024\nSeries B Preferred Stock\n5\n \n$\n63.76\n \n5\n \n$\n63.76\n \nYear ended September 30, 2023\nSeries A Preferred Stock\n(1)\n$\n2\n \n$\n33.76\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n50.64\n \nSeries B Preferred Stock\n5\n \n$\n63.76\n \n5\n \n$\n63.76\n \nTotal\n$\n7\n \n$\n7\n \n(1)\nOn April 3, 2023, we redeemed all \n40,250\n outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock with a carrying value of $\n41\n million, which triggered the redemption of the related depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, for an aggregate redemption value of $\n40\n million. Preferred stock dividends on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the year ended September 30, 2023 included dividends declared during the year, as well as the $\n1\n million excess of the carrying value of our Series A Preferred Stock over the redemption value, which was reported as an offset to preferred dividends and increased net income available to common shareholders.\n147\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

In December 2024, our Board of Directors authorized common stock repurchases of up to $\n1.5\n billion, which replaced the previous authorization.  Our share repurchases are effected primarily through regular open-market purchases, typically under a SEC Rule 10b-18 plan, the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position, applicable legal and regulatory constraints, general market conditions and the price and trading volumes of our common stock.  During the year ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased \n7.4\n million shares of our common stock for $\n1.1\n billion at an average price of $\n148\n per share.  As of September 30, 2025, $\n399\n million remained available under the Board of Directors’ common stock repurchase authorization.  \nCommon stock dividends\nDividends per common share declared and paid are detailed in the following table for each respective period.\n \nYear ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nDividends per common share - declared \n$\n2.00\n \n$\n1.80\n \n$\n1.68\n \nDividends per common share - paid\n$\n1.95\n \n$\n1.77\n \n$\n1.60\n \nOur dividend payout ratio is detailed in the following table for each respective period and is computed by dividing dividends declared per common share by earnings per diluted common share.\n \nYear ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2023\nDividend payout ratio\n19.4\n \n%\n18.6\n \n%\n21.1\n \n%\nWe expect to continue paying cash dividends; however, the payment and rate of dividends on our common stock are subject to several factors including our operating results, financial and regulatory requirements or restrictions, and the availability of funds from our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, which may also be subject to restrictions under regulatory capital rules.

Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (“the Plan”), for our employees, Board of Directors, and independent contractor financial advisors.  The Plan authorizes us to grant \n96.4\n million shares (including the shares available for grant under \nsix\n predecessor plans).  As of September 30, 2025, \n11.1\n million shares remained available for grant under the Plan.  We may utilize treasury shares for grants under the Plan, though we are also permitted to issue new shares.  Our share-based compensation accounting policies are described in Note 2.\nRestricted stock units\nWe may grant RSU awards under the Plan in connection with initial employment or under various retention programs for individuals who are responsible for contributing to our management, growth, and/or profitability.  We may also grant RSU awards in lieu of cash for a portion of the annual bonus awarded to officers and certain other employees who receive an annual bonus in excess of $\n275,000\n.  We also grant performance-based RSU awards to certain executives which vest based on the firm’s achievement of certain financial or other targets.  Under the Plan, RSU awards are generally restricted for a \nthree\n- to \nfive-year\n period.  RSUs are generally forfeitable in the event of termination other than for death, disability, or qualifying retirement.\nWe grant RSUs annually to non-employee members of our Board of Directors.  The RSUs granted to these Directors vest over a \none-year\n period from their grant date or upon retirement from our Board.\n153\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

For the years ended September 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, total share-based compensation amortization related to these RSAs was $\n3\n million, $\n6\n million, and $\n9\n million, respectively.  As of September 30, 2025, there were $\n2\n million of total pre-tax compensation costs not yet recognized for these RSAs.  These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \none year\n.  \nEmployee stock purchase plan\nUnder the 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, we are authorized to issue up to \n13.1\n million shares of common stock to eligible employees.  Under the terms of the plan, share purchases in any calendar year are limited to the lesser of \n1,000\n shares or shares with a fair value of $\n25,000\n.  The purchase price of the stock is \n85\n% of the average high and low market price on the day prior to the purchase date.  Under the plan, we sold approximately \n176\n thousand, \n361\n thousand and \n428\n thousand shares to employees during the years ended September 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.  The related compensation expense is calculated as the value of the \n15\n% discount from market value and was $\n6\n million, $\n6\n million, and $\n7\n million for the years ended September 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther compensation\nOur profit-sharing plan and employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) are qualified plans that provide certain death, disability, or retirement benefits for our U.S.-based employees who meet certain service requirements.  The plans are noncontributory and our contributions, if any, are determined annually by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, on a discretionary basis and are recognized as compensation expense throughout the year.  Benefits become fully vested after \nfive years\n of qualified service, age 65, or if a participant separates from service due to death or disability.\nAll shares owned by the ESOP are included in earnings per share calculations.  Cash dividends paid to the ESOP are reflected as a reduction of retained earnings.  The number of shares of our common stock held by the ESOP was \n6.3\n million and \n6.5\n million at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.  The market value of our common stock held by the ESOP at September 30, 2025 was $\n1.09\n billion, of which $\n11\n million was unearned (not yet vested) by ESOP plan participants.\n154\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nWe also offer a plan pursuant to section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is a qualified plan that may provide for a discretionary contribution or a matching contribution each year.  Matching contributions are \n75\n% of the first $\n1,000\n and \n25\n% of the next $\n1,000\n of eligible compensation deferred by each participant annually.\nOur LTIP is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits to certain employees who meet certain compensation or production requirements.  Corporate-owned life insurance is the primary source of funding for this plan.  See Note 11 for information regarding the carrying value of these corporate-owned life insurance policies.\nContributions to the qualified plans and the LTIP are approved annually by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.\nThe VDCP is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain employees and independent contractor financial advisors, in which eligible participants may elect to defer a percentage or specific dollar amount of their compensation.  Corporate-owned life insurance is the primary source of funding for this plan.\nCompensation expense associated with all other employee compensation plans, including those previously described, totaled $\n230\n million, $\n254\n million and $\n223\n million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNOTE 23 – \nREGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nRJF, as a bank holding company and financial holding company, as well as Raymond James Bank, TriState Capital Bank, our broker-dealer subsidiaries, and our trust subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements by various regulatory authorities.  Capital levels of each entity are monitored to ensure compliance with our various regulatory capital requirements.  Failure to meet applicable capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions, by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial results.\nAs a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), that has made an election to be a financial holding company, RJF is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Fed.  We are subject to the Fed’s capital rules which establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and implement, in the U.S., the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  We apply the standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets and are also subject to the market risk provisions of the Fed’s capital rules (“market risk rule”).\nUnder these rules, requirements are established for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations.  RJF, Raymond James Bank, and TriState Capital Bank are required to maintain minimum leverage ratios (defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets), as well as minimum ratios of tier 1 capital, common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, and total capital to risk-weighted assets.  These capital ratios incorporate quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under the regulatory capital rules and are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings, and other factors.  We calculate these ratios in order to assess compliance with both regulatory requirements and internal capital policies.  In order to maintain our ability to take certain capital actions, including dividends and common equity repurchases, and to make certain discretionary bonus payments, we must hold a capital conservation buffer above our minimum risk-based capital requirements.  As of September 30, 2025, capital levels at RJF, Raymond James Bank, and TriState Capital Bank exceeded the capital conservation buffer requirements and each entity was categorized as “well-capitalized.”\n155\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nThe following table presents regulatory capital ratio requirements for RJF as of September 30, 2025 and 2024. \n \nRequired ratio \n(1)\nWell-capitalized\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\n$ in millions\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRJF:\nTier 1 leverage\n4.0\n \n%\nN/A \n(2)\n13.1\n \n%\n$\n11,156\n \n12.8\n \n%\n$\n10,383\n \nTier 1 capital\n8.5\n \n%\n6.0\n \n%\n23.0\n \n%\n$\n11,156\n \n22.8\n \n%\n$\n10,383\n \nCET1 capital\n7.0\n \n%\nN/A \n(2)\n22.9\n \n%\n$\n11,081\n \n22.6\n \n%\n$\n10,307\n \nTotal capital\n10.5\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\n24.1\n \n%\n$\n11,687\n \n24.1\n \n%\n$\n11,001\n \n \n(1)\nThe required ratio for tier 1 capital, CET1 capital, and total capital reflect our minimum risk-based capital requirements plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%.  \n(2)\nThe Fed’s regulations do not establish well-capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.  \nAs of September 30, 2025, RJF’s regulatory capital increased compared with September 30, 2024 driven by an increase in equity due to positive earnings, partially offset by share repurchases and dividends.  RJF’s tier 1 capital ratio increased compared with September 30, 2024 resulting from the increase in regulatory capital, partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets largely due to an increase in bank loans.  RJF’s tier 1 leverage ratio at September 30, 2025 increased compared to September 30, 2024 due to the increase in regulatory capital, which was partially offset by higher average assets. The increase in average assets was primarily driven by increases in average bank loans, partially offset by a decline in our available-for-sale securities portfolio.\nFor RJF to maintain its status as a financial holding company, Raymond James Bank (“RJB”) and TriState Capital Bank (“TSC”) must, among other things, qualify as “well-capitalized.”  The following table presents regulatory capital ratio requirements for RJB and TSC as of September 2025 and September 2024.  Our banks’ failure to remain well-capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our financial statements.  \n \nRequired ratio \n(1)\nWell-capitalized\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\n$ in millions\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRaymond James Bank:\nTier 1 leverage\n4.0\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\n8.0\n \n%\n$\n3,434\n \n8.1\n \n%\n$\n3,401\n \nTier 1 capital\n8.5\n \n%\n8.0\n \n%\n13.9\n \n%\n$\n3,434\n \n14.4\n \n%\n$\n3,401\n \nCET1 capital\n7.0\n \n%\n6.5\n \n%\n13.9\n \n%\n$\n3,434\n \n14.4\n \n%\n$\n3,401\n \nTotal capital\n10.5\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\n15.2\n \n%\n$\n3,743\n \n15.7\n \n%\n$\n3,698\n \nTriState Capital Bank:\nTier 1 leverage\n4.0\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\n7.6\n \n%\n$\n1,661\n \n7.5\n \n%\n$\n1,505\n \nTier 1 capital\n8.5\n \n%\n8.0\n \n%\n16.8\n \n%\n$\n1,661\n \n16.9\n \n%\n$\n1,505\n \nCET1 capital\n7.0\n \n%\n6.5\n \n%\n16.8\n \n%\n$\n1,661\n \n16.9\n \n%\n$\n1,505\n \nTotal capital\n10.5\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\n17.5\n \n%\n$\n1,732\n \n17.5\n \n%\n$\n1,558\n \n \n(1)\nThe required ratio for tier 1 capital, CET1 capital, and total capital reflect our minimum risk-based capital requirements plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%.\n \nOur bank subsidiaries may pay dividends to RJF out of retained earnings without prior approval of their regulators as long as the dividends do not exceed the sum of their current calendar year and the previous two calendar years’ retained net income and they satisfy applicable regulatory capital requirements.  Dividends paid to RJF from our bank subsidiaries may be limited to the extent that capital is needed to support balance sheet growth or as part of our liquidity and capital management activities.\n156\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nCertain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  As a member firm of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), RJ&A is subject to FINRA’s capital requirements, which are substantially the same as Rule 15c3-1.  Rule 15c3-1 provides for an “alternative net capital requirement,” which RJ&A has elected.  Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $1.5 million or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client balances.  FINRA may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements.  As of September 30, 2025, RJ&A had excess net capital available to remit dividends to RJF, subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including, in certain cases, regulatory approval.  \nThe following table presents the net capital position of RJ&A.\nSeptember 30,\n$ in millions\n2025\n2024\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc.:\n \n \n(Alternative Method elected)\n \n \nNet capital as a percent of aggregate debit items\n30.3\n \n%\n33.6\n \n%\nNet capital\n$\n1,030\n \n$\n1,019\n \nLess: required net capital\n(\n68\n)\n(\n61\n)\nExcess net capital\n$\n962\n \n$\n958\n \nAs of September 30, 2025, all of our other active regulated domestic and international subsidiaries were in compliance with and exceeded all applicable capital requirements.\nNOTE 24 – \nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share.\n \nYear ended September 30,\n$ in millions, except per share amounts\n2025\n2024\n2023\nIncome for basic earnings per common share:\nNet income available to common shareholders\n$\n2,130\n \n$\n2,063\n \n$\n1,733\n \nLess allocation of earnings and dividends to participating securities\n(\n3\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n5\n)\nNet income available to common shareholders after participating securities\n$\n2,127\n \n$\n2,059\n \n$\n1,728\n \nIncome for diluted earnings per common share:\n \n \n \nNet income available to common shareholders\n$\n2,130\n \n$\n2,063\n \n$\n1,733\n \nLess allocation of earnings and dividends to participating securities\n(\n3\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n5\n)\nNet income available to common shareholders after participating securities\n$\n2,127\n \n$\n2,059\n \n$\n1,728\n \nCommon shares:\n \n \n \nAverage common shares in basic computation\n202.0\n \n207.1\n \n211.8\n \nDilutive effect of outstanding stock options and certain RSUs\n4.6\n \n5.2\n \n5.1\n \nAverage common and common equivalent shares used in diluted computation\n206.6\n \n212.3\n \n216.9\n \nEarnings per common share:\n \n \n \nBasic\n$\n10.53\n \n$\n9.94\n \n$\n8.16\n \nDiluted\n$\n10.30\n \n$\n9.70\n \n$\n7.97\n \nStock options and certain RSUs excluded from weighted-average diluted common shares because their effect would be antidilutive\n0.1\n \n0.1\n \n0.5\n \nThe allocation of earnings and dividends to participating securities in the preceding table represents dividends paid during the year to participating securities, consisting of RSAs and certain RSUs, plus an allocation of undistributed earnings to such participating securities.  Participating securities and related dividends paid on these participating securities were insignificant for the years ended September 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023.  Undistributed earnings are allocated to participating securities based upon their right to share in earnings as if all earnings for the period had been distributed.\n157\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nNOTE 25 – \nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe currently operate through the following \nfive\n segments: PCG; Capital Markets; Asset Management; Bank; and Other.  The segments are determined based on the manner in which financial information is evaluated by management as well as the services provided and the distribution channels served.  Our Chief Executive Officer is the firm’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The CODM regularly reviews segment pre-tax income and its significant components in comparison to expected results as part of evaluating segment performance and determining how to allocate our resources.  The financial results of our segments are presented using the same policies as those described in Note 2.  Segment results include allocations of most corporate expenses to each segment.  Refer to the following discussion of the Other segment for a description of the corporate expenses that are not allocated to segments.  Intersegment revenues, expenses, receivables, and payables are eliminated upon consolidation.\nThe PCG segment provides financial planning, investment advisory, and securities transaction services in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. for which we generally charge either asset-based fees or sales commissions.  The PCG segment also earns revenues for distribution and related services performed related to mutual and other funds, fixed and variable annuities, and insurance products.  The segment includes servicing fee revenues from third-party mutual fund and annuity companies whose products we distribute and from banks to which we sweep a portion of our clients’ cash deposits as part of the RJBDP, our multi-bank sweep program.  The segment also includes net interest earnings primarily on assets segregated for regulatory purposes, margin loans provided to clients, cash balances, and securities borrowing transactions, net of interest paid on client cash balances in the Client Interest Program and securities lending transactions.  In the following table, “All other” non-interest expenses for our PCG segment primarily included communications and information processing expenses, occupancy and equipment expenses, business development expenses, and professional fees.\nOur Capital Markets segment conducts investment banking, institutional sales, securities trading, equity research, and the syndication and management of investments in low-income housing funds and funds of a similar nature that generally qualify for tax credits.  We primarily conduct these activities in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.  In the following table, “All other” non-interest expenses for our Capital Markets segment primarily included communications and information processing expenses, business development expenses, provisions for certain legal and regulatory matters, professional fees, and occupancy and equipment expenses.\nOur Asset Management segment earns asset management and related administrative fees for providing asset management, portfolio management, and related administrative services to retail and institutional clients.  This segment oversees a portion of our fee-based assets under administration for our PCG clients through our Asset Management Services division.  This segment also provides asset management services through Raymond James Investment Management for certain retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions, institutional accounts, and proprietary mutual funds that we manage.  This segment also earns asset management and related administrative fees through services provided by Raymond James Trust, N.A. and Raymond James Trust Company of New Hampshire.  In the following table, “All other” non-interest expenses for our Asset Management segment primarily included investment sub-advisory fees and communications and information processing expenses.\nOur Bank segment provides various types of loans, including SBL, corporate loans, residential mortgage loans, and tax-exempt loans.  This segment is active in corporate loan syndications and participations and lending directly to clients.  This segment also provides FDIC-insured deposit accounts, including to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, and other retail and corporate deposit and liquidity management products and services.  This segment generates net interest income principally through the interest income earned on loans and an investment portfolio of available-for-sale securities, which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings.  In the following table, “All other” non-interest expenses for our Bank segment primarily included RJBDP fees paid to PCG and communications and information processing expenses.\nThe Other segment includes interest income on certain corporate cash balances, the results of our private equity investments, which predominantly consist of investments in third-party funds, certain other corporate investing activity, and certain corporate overhead costs of RJF that are not allocated to operating segments including the interest costs on our public debt, certain provisions for legal and regulatory matters, and certain acquisition-related expenses.  \n158\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.

The Parent’s primary activities include investments in subsidiaries and corporate investments, including cash management and corporate-owned life insurance policies.  The primary source of operating cash available to the Parent is provided by dividends from its subsidiaries.\nThe broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Parent, including RJ&A our principal domestic broker-dealer, and certain other subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum amount of net capital due to regulatory requirements.  RJ&A is further required by certain covenants in its borrowing agreements to maintain minimum net capital equal to \n10\n% of aggregate debit balances.  At September 30, 2025, each of these subsidiaries exceeded their minimum net capital requirements (see Note 23 for additional information).\nOf the Parent’s net assets as of September 30, 2025, approximately $\n119\n million of its investment in RJ&A, Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., and SumRidge Partners, LLC (our largest U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries) was available for distribution to the Parent without further regulatory approvals.  As of September 30, 2025, approximately $\n4.01\n billion of the net assets of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries and bank subsidiaries were restricted from distribution to the Parent due to regulatory or other restrictions without prior approval of the respective entity’s regulator.  In addition, a large portion of our non-U.S. subsidiaries’ net assets was held to meet regulatory requirements and was not available for use by the Parent.\n160\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIndex\nRJF corporate cash of $\n3.67\n billion and $\n2.16\n billion as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, included cash and cash equivalents held directly by the Parent and cash loaned by the Parent to RJ&A which is included in “Intercompany receivables from subsidiaries” in the following table.  As of September 30, 2025 and 2024, the amount loaned by the Parent to RJ&A, which RJ&A had invested on behalf of RJF or otherwise deployed in its normal business activities, was $\n1.40\n billion and $\n1.43\n billion, respectively.  Cash and cash equivalents in the following table included investments in short-term U.S. Treasuries, cash held directly by RJF in depository accounts at third-party financial institutions, and unrestricted cash held in depository accounts at Raymond James Bank.

Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes during the three months ended September 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n \nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by COSO.  Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2025.  KPMG LLP, who audited and reported on our consolidated financial statements included in this report, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2025 (included as follows).\n164\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIndex\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nRaymond James Financial, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Raymond James Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial condition of the Company as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated November 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nNew York, New York\nNovember 25, 2025 \n165\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC.
