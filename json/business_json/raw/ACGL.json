  "item1_text": "Item 1A, “\nRisk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry, Business and Operations”\n Depending on business opportunities and the mix of business that may comprise our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage portfolios, we may seek to adjust our self-imposed limitations on probable maximum pre-tax loss for catastrophe exposed business and mortgage default exposed business. See \n“—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Ceded Reinsurance”\n for a discussion of our catastrophe reinsurance programs.\nMARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nOur investment results are subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to changes in the business, financial condition or results of operations of the entities in which we invest, as well as changes in general economic conditions and overall market conditions. We are also exposed to potential loss from various market risks, including changes in equity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn accordance with the SEC’s Financial Reporting Release No. 48, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings, fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments as of December 31, 2024. Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and consists of several components, including liquidity, basis and price risks. \nThe sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2024 presents hypothetical losses in cash flows, earnings and fair values of market sensitive instruments which were held by us on December 31, 2024 and are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity security prices. This risk management \nARCH CAPITAL\n95\n2024 FORM 10-K\ndiscussion and the estimated amounts generated from the following sensitivity analysis represent forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The analysis methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses.\nThe focus of the SEC’s market risk rules is on price risk. For purposes of specific risk analysis, we employ sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings, fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments. The financial instruments included in the following sensitivity analysis consist of all of our investments and cash.\nInvestment Market Risk\nFixed Income Securities\n. We invest in interest rate sensitive securities, primarily debt securities. We consider the effect of interest rate movements on the fair value of our fixed maturities, short-term investments and certain of our other investments, equity securities and investment funds accounted for using the equity method which invest in fixed income securities (collectively, “Fixed Income Securities”) and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation. As interest rates rise, the fair value of our Fixed Income Securities falls, and the converse is also true. Based on historical observations, there is a low probability that all interest rate yield curves would shift in the same direction at the same time. Furthermore, at times interest rate movements in certain credit sectors exhibit a much lower correlation to changes in U.S. Treasury yields. Accordingly, the actual effect of interest rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth in the following tables. \nThe following table summarizes the effect that an immediate, parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on our investment portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n(U.S. dollars in billions)\nInterest Rate Shift in Basis Points\n-100\n-50\n-\n+50\n+100\nDec. 31, 2024\nTotal fair value\n$\n40.0 \n$\n39.5 \n$\n38.9 \n$\n38.4 \n$\n37.9 \nChange from base\n2.8 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n(1.4)\n%\n(2.7)\n%\nChange in unrealized value\n$\n1.09 \n$\n0.54 \n$\n(0.54)\n$\n(1.05)\nDec. 31, 2023\nTotal fair value\n$\n33.6 \n$\n33.1 \n$\n32.7 \n$\n32.2 \n$\n31.7 \nChange from base\n3.0 \n%\n1.5 \n%\n(1.4)\n%\n(2.8)\n%\nChange in unrealized value\n$\n0.98 \n$\n0.49 \n$\n(0.46)\n$\n(0.91)\nIn addition, we consider the effect of credit spread movements on the market value of our Fixed Income Securities and the corresponding change in unrealized value. \nAs credit spreads widen, the fair value of our Fixed Income Securities falls, and the converse is also true. In periods where the spreads on our Fixed Income Securities are much higher than their historical average due to short-term market dislocations, a parallel shift in credit spread levels would result in a much more pronounced change in unrealized value. \nThe following table summarizes the effect that an immediate, parallel shift in credit spreads in a static interest rate environment would have had on the portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n(U.S. dollars in billions)\nCredit Spread Shift in Percentage\n-100\n-50\n-\n+50\n+100\nDec. 31, 2024\nTotal fair value\n$\n40.0 \n$\n39.5 \n$\n38.9 \n$\n38.4 \n$\n37.8 \nChange from base\n2.8 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n(1.4)\n%\n(2.8)\n%\nChange in unrealized value\n$\n1.09 \n$\n0.54 \n$\n(0.54)\n$\n(1.09)\nDec. 31, 2023\nTotal fair value\n$\n33.8 \n$\n33.2 \n$\n32.7 \n$\n32.1 \n$\n31.5 \nChange from base\n3.4 \n%\n1.7 \n%\n(1.7)\n%\n(3.4)\n%\nChange in unrealized value\n$\n1.11 \n$\n0.56 \n$\n(0.56)\n$\n(1.11)\nAnother method that attempts to measure portfolio risk is Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). VaR measures the worst expected loss under normal market conditions over a specific time interval at a given confidence level. The 1-year 95th percentile parametric VaR reported herein estimates that 95% of the time, the portfolio loss in a one-year horizon would be less than or equal to the calculated number, stated as a percentage of the measured portfolio’s initial value. The VaR is a variance-covariance based estimate, based on linear sensitivities of a portfolio to a broad set of systematic market risk factors and idiosyncratic risk factors mapped to the portfolio exposures. The relationships between the risk factors are estimated using historical data, and the most recent data points are generally given more weight. As of December 31, 2024, our portfolio’s 95th percentile VaR was estimated to be 5.6%, compared to an estimated 7.8% at December 31, 2023. In periods where the volatility of the risk factors mapped to our portfolio’s exposures is higher due to market conditions, the resulting VaR is higher than in other periods.\nEquity Securities. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of our investments in equity securities and certain investments accounted for using the equity method with underlying equity strategies totaled $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. These investments are exposed to price risk, which is the potential loss arising from decreases in fair value. An immediate hypothetical 10% decline in the value of each position would reduce the fair value of such investments by approximately $149 million and $101 million at \nARCH CAPITAL\n96\n2024 FORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and would have decreased book value per share by approximately $0.40 and $0.27, respectively.\n \nAn immediate hypothetical 10% increase in the value of each position would increase the fair value of such investments by approximately $149 million and $101 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and would have increased book value per share by approximately $0.40 and $0.27, respectively.\nInvestment-Related Derivatives.\n At December 31, 2024, the notional value of all derivative instruments (excluding foreign currency forward contracts which are included in the foreign currency exchange risk analysis below) was $5.0 billion, compared to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2023. If the underlying exposure of each investment-related derivative held at December 31, 2024 depreciated by 100 basis points, it would have resulted in a reduction in net income of approximately $50 million, and a decrease in book value per share of $0.13, compared to $42 million and $0.11, respectively, on investment-related derivatives held at December 31, 2023. If the underlying exposure of each investment-related derivative held at December 31, 2024 appreciated by 100 basis points, it would have resulted in an increase in net income of approximately $50 million, and an increase in book value per share of $0.13, compared to $42 million and $0.11, respectively, on investment-related derivatives held at December 31, 2023. See \nnote 11, “Derivative Instruments,”\n to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional disclosures concerning derivatives.\nFor further discussion on investment activity, please refer to “—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financial Condition—Investable Assets.”\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nForeign currency rate risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Through our subsidiaries and branches located in various foreign countries, we conduct our insurance and reinsurance operations in a variety of local currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We generally hold investments in foreign currencies which are intended to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our net insurance liabilities. We may also utilize foreign currency forward contracts and currency options as part of our investment strategy. See \nnote 11, “Derivative Instruments,”\n to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information.\nThe following table provides a summary of our net foreign currency exchange exposures, as well as foreign currency derivatives in place to manage these exposures:\n(U.S. dollars in millions, except \nper share data)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nNet assets (liabilities), denominated in foreign currencies, excluding shareholders’ equity and derivatives\n$\n(815)\n$\n(300)\nShareholders’ equity denominated in foreign currencies (1)\n1,120 \n1,158 \nNet foreign currency forward contracts outstanding (2)\n453 \n246 \nNet exposures denominated in foreign currencies\n$\n758 \n$\n1,104 \nPre-tax impact of a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies:\n \n \nShareholders’ equity\n$\n(76)\n$\n(110)\nBook value per share\n$\n(0.20)\n$\n(0.30)\nPre-tax impact of a hypothetical 10% decline of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies:\n \n \nShareholders’ equity\n$\n76 \n$\n110 \nBook value per share\n$\n0.20 \n$\n0.30 \n(1)    Represents capital contributions held in the foreign currencies of our operating units.\n(2)    Represents the net notional value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.\nAlthough the Company generally attempts to match the currency of its projected liabilities with investments in the same currencies, from time to time the Company may elect to over or underweight one or more currencies, which could increase the Company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and increase the volatility of the Company’s shareholders’ equity. Historical observations indicate a low probability that all foreign currency exchange rates would shift against the U.S. Dollar in the same direction and at the same time and, accordingly, the actual effect of foreign currency rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth above. For further discussion on foreign exchange activity, please refer to “—Results of Operations.”\nARCH CAPITAL\n97\n2024 FORM 10-K\nEffects of Inflation\nGeneral economic inflation may continue to remain at elevated levels for an extended period of time. The potential also exists, after a catastrophe loss or pandemic events like COVID-19, for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy. This may have a material effect on the adequacy of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, especially in longer-tailed lines of business, and on the market value of our investment portfolio through rising interest rates. The anticipated effects of inflation are considered in our pricing models, reserving processes and exposure management, across all lines of business and types of loss including natural catastrophe events. The actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled and will vary by the specific type of inflation affecting each line of business.\nITEM 7A.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded the acquired U.S. Middle Market Property & Casualty and U.S. Entertainment Property and Casualty Insurance Business (“MCE”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded MCE from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. MCE represents 1.6% of total assets and 3.5% of total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \nARCH CAPITAL\n100\n2024 FORM 10-K\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nAs described in Notes 3, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured events which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s total reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses was $29.4 billion. For the insurance and reinsurance segments, management estimates ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information. Ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are generally determined by projection of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future. Management makes a number of key assumptions in their reserving process, including estimating loss development patterns and expected loss ratios. For the mortgage segment, the lead actuarial methodology used by management is a frequency-severity method based on the inventory of pending delinquencies. The assumptions of frequency and severity reflect judgments based on historical data and experience. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing their estimate, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the aforementioned key actuarial methods and key assumptions, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including controls over the selection of key actuarial methods and development of key assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing one or a combination of procedures, including (i) developing an independent estimate, on a test basis, of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses, and comparing the independent estimate to management’s actuarially determined reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses to evaluate the reasonableness of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses and (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the actuarial methods and reasonableness of the assumptions related to loss development patterns, expected loss ratios, frequency, and severity used by management to determine the Company’s reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.    General\nArch Capital Group Ltd. (“Arch Capital,” “Arch” or the “Company”) is a publicly listed Bermuda exempted company which provides insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance on a worldwide basis through its wholly owned subsidiaries. As used herein, the Company means Arch Capital and its subsidiaries. Similarly, “Common Shares” means the common shares of Arch Capital. \nThe Company has reclassified the presentation of certain prior year information to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on the Company’s net income, shareholders’equity or cash flows.\n All amounts are in millions, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted.\n2.    Acquisition\nOn August 1, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Allianz’s U.S Middle Market Property & Casualty Insurance and U.S. Entertainment Property and Casualty Insurance Business (“MCE Acquisition”). This business is written by Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company, an affiliate of Allianz, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Business Entities”), in each case, relating to relevant policies with accident years 2016 and onwards (collectively, the “Business”), as well as certain assets of Allianz and its affiliates related to the Business. In connection with the acquisition of the Business, the Company also entered into certain reinsurance agreements relating to the Business and the Business Entities and other agreements providing for administration and other services for the Business Entities by the Company for the applicable policies being reinsured following the closing. The acquisition of the Business is an important part of the Company’s growth strategy, and provides a ballast to our existing insurance business.\n \nIt further enhances the Company’s capabilities in the U.S. middle markets and represents an attractive way to enter a new niche entertainment insurance market.\nAggregate cash consideration for the transaction was $\n450\n million. Direct costs related to the acquisition are immaterial, and were expensed as incurred. These include one-time costs that are directly attributable to third party consulting fees and other professional and legal fees related to the acquisition. Such costs are included within ‘corporate expenses’ in the consolidated statement of income. The Business acquired is included within the Company’s insurance segment beginning from the acquisition date.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values on August 1, 2024. The fair value of the assets and liabilities are preliminary and may change with offsetting adjustments to goodwill. The Company may make further adjustments to its purchase price allocation through the end of the permissible one-year measurement period.\nTotal\nUseful Life\nPurchase price\nCash paid (a)\n$\n450\n \nAssets Acquired\nCash and investments, at fair value\n$\n2,332\n \nPremiums receivable, net of commissions\n265\nIntangible asset -- distribution relationships\n220\n10\n years\nIntangible asset -- value of business acquired\n165\n1\n-\n2\n years\nIntangible asset -- other (1)\n178\n5\n-\n7\n years\nOther assets acquired\n167\nTotal assets acquired\n$\n3,327\n \nLiabilities Acquired\nReserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses \n$\n2,418\n \nUnearned premiums\n636\nOther liabilities acquired\n69\nTotal liabilities acquired\n3,123\n \nIdentifiable net assets acquired (b)\n$\n204\n \nGoodwill (a) - (b)\n$\n246\n \n(1) \nIncludes $\n128\n million related to the net fair value adjustment to reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses on August 1, 2024.\nThe Company recognized goodwill of $\n246\n million that is primarily attributed to the expanded presence and long-term growth opportunities in the insurance market provided by this strategic acquisition. Approximately $\n565\n million of the acquired goodwill and intangibles is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. At the date of the acquisition, the Company established a net deferred tax asset of $\n24\n million related to the estimated fair value of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums.\nIntangible assets resulting from the acquisition are amortized as part of ‘amortization of intangible assets’ in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The significant fair value adjustments and related future amortization are as follows:\nValue of business acquired (“VOBA”)—\n which represents the present value of the expected underwriting profit within the unearned premium liability, less costs to service the related policies and a risk premium. The fair value of VOBA was determined after taking into consideration certain key assumptions, including the estimated cost of capital, \nARCH CAPITAL\n107\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ninvestment yield, loss ratio and related expenses;\nReserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses—\nto reflect a decrease related to the present value of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses based on the estimated payout patterns, partially offset by an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses related to the estimated market based risk margin. The risk margin represents the estimated costs of capital required by a market participant to assume the losses and loss adjustment expenses. The fair value of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses was determined after taking into consideration certain key assumptions, including the estimated cost of capital, and investment yield.\nDistribution relationships—\nthe value of the distribution relationships was determined after taking into consideration certain key assumptions, including the estimated cost of capital, investment yield, retention rates, loss ratios, related expenses and effective tax rates that would impact the expected cash flows from Business policies written on a go forward basis.\nThe results of the acquired Business have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning as of their acquisition date. It is impracticable to provide historical supplemental pro forma financial information along with revenue and earnings subsequent to the acquisition due to a variety of factors, including access to historical information and the operations of acquirees being integrated within the Company shortly after closing and not operating as discrete operations within the Company’s organizational structure.\n3.    Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Arch Capital and its subsidiaries, including Arch Reinsurance Ltd. (“Arch Re Bermuda”), Arch Reinsurance Company (“Arch Re U.S.”), Arch Capital Group (U.S.) Inc.(“Arch-U.S.”), Arch Insurance Company, Arch Specialty Insurance Company, Arch Property Casualty Insurance Company (“Arch P&C”), Arch Indemnity Insurance Company (“Arch Indemnity Insurance”), Arch Insurance Canada Ltd. (“Arch Insurance Canada”), Arch Reinsurance Europe Designated Activity Company (“Arch Re Europe”), Arch Mortgage Insurance Company (“AMIC”), Arch Mortgage Guaranty Company (“AMG”), United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company (“UGRIC”), Arch Lenders Mortgage Indemnity Ltd. (“Arch Indemnity”), Arch Insurance (EU) Designated Activity Company (“Arch Insurance (EU)”), Arch Insurance (U.K.) Limited (“Arch Insurance (U.K.)”) and the Company’s participation on Lloyd’s of London syndicates: 2012 (“Arch Syndicate 2012”) \nand 1955 (“Arch Syndicate 1955” and together with Arch Syndicate 2012, the Company’s “Lloyd’s Syndicates”). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. The Company’s principal estimates include:\n•\nThe reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses;\n•\nReinsurance recoverable on unpaid and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including the provision for uncollectible amounts;\n•\nEstimates of written and earned premiums;\n•\nThe valuation of the investment portfolio and assessment of allowance for credit losses;\n•\nThe valuation of purchased intangible assets;\n•\nThe assessment of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment; and\n•\nThe valuation of deferred income tax assets.\n(b) Premium Revenues and Related Expenses\nInsurance.\n \nInsurance premiums written are generally recorded at the policy inception and are primarily earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies for all products, usually \n12\n months. Premiums written include estimates that are derived from multiple sources which include the historical experience of the underlying business, similar business and available industry information. Unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written that relates to the unexpired terms of in-force insurance policies.\nReinsurance. \nReinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by brokers and ceding companies, supplemented by the Company’s own estimates of premiums where reports have not been received. The determination of premium estimates requires a review of the Company’s experience with the ceding companies, familiarity with each market, the timing of the reported information, an analysis and understanding of the characteristics of each line of business, and management’s judgment of the impact of various factors, including premium or loss trends, on the volume of business written and ceded to the Company. On an ongoing basis, the Company’s underwriters review the amounts reported by these third parties for reasonableness based on their experience and knowledge of the subject class of business, taking into account the Company’s historical experience with the brokers or ceding companies. In addition, reinsurance contracts under which the Company assumes business \nARCH CAPITAL\n108\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ngenerally contain specific provisions which allow the Company to perform audits of the ceding company to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, including accurate and timely reporting of information. Based on a review of all available information, management establishes premium estimates where reports have not been received. Premium estimates are updated when new information is received and differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined.\nReinsurance premiums written are recorded based on the type of contracts the Company writes. Premiums on the Company’s excess of loss and pro rata reinsurance contracts are estimated when the business is underwritten. For excess of loss contracts, premiums are recorded as written based on the terms of the contract. Estimates of premiums written under pro rata contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by the brokers and the ceding companies. For multi-year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments, generally, only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy. The remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi-year term.\nReinsurance premiums written, irrespective of the class of business, are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies or reinsurance contracts. Contracts and policies written on a “losses occurring” basis cover claims that may occur during the term of the contract or policy, which is typically \n12\n months. Accordingly, the premium is earned evenly over the term. Contracts which are written on a “risks attaching” basis cover claims which attach to the underlying insurance policies written during the terms of such contracts. Premiums earned on such contracts usually extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract, typically resulting in recognition of premiums earned over a \n24\n-month period. Certain of the Company’s reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the experience under the contracts. Premiums written and earned, as well as related acquisition expenses, are recorded based upon the projected experience under such contracts.\nThe Company also writes certain reinsurance business that is intended to provide insurers with risk management solutions that complement traditional reinsurance. Under these contracts, the Company assumes a measured amount of insurance risk in exchange for an anticipated margin, which is typically lower than on traditional reinsurance contracts. The terms and conditions of these contracts may include additional or return premiums based on loss experience, loss \ncorridors, sublimits and caps. Examples of such business include aggregate stop-loss coverages, financial quota share coverages and multi-year retrospectively rated excess of loss coverages. If these contracts are deemed to transfer risk, they are accounted for as reinsurance. Otherwise, such contracts are accounted for under the deposit method.\nMortgage. \nMortgage guaranty insurance policies are contracts that are generally non-cancelable by the insurer, are renewable at a fixed price, and provide for payment of premiums on a monthly, annual or single basis. Upon renewal, the Company is not able to re-underwrite or re-price its policies. Consistent with industry accounting practices, premiums written on a monthly basis are earned as coverage is provided. Premiums written on an annual basis are amortized on a monthly pro rata basis over the year of coverage. Primary mortgage insurance premiums written on policies covering more than one year are referred to as single premiums. A portion of the revenue from single premiums is recognized in premiums earned in the current period, and the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums and earned over the estimated expiration of risk of the policy. If single premium policies related to insured loans are canceled due to repayment by the borrower and the policy is a non-refundable product, the remaining unearned premium related to each canceled policy is recognized as earned premium upon notification of the cancellation. \nUnearned premiums for the Company’s mortgage operations represent the portion of premiums written that is applicable to the estimated unexpired risk of insured loans. A portion of premium payments may be refundable if the insured cancels coverage, which generally occurs when the loan is repaid, the loan amortizes to a sufficiently low amount to trigger a lender permitted or legally required cancellation, or the value of the property has increased sufficiently in accordance with the terms of the contract. Premium refunds reduce premiums earned in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, only unearned premiums are refundable.\nReinstatement premiums\n for the Company’s insurance and reinsurance operations are recognized at the time a loss event occurs, where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms. Reinstatement premiums, if obligatory, are fully earned when recognized. The accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on an estimate of losses and loss adjustment expenses, which reflects management’s judgment. \nPremium estimates\n are reviewed by management at least quarterly. Such review includes a comparison of actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates. Based on management’s review, the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated, and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes \nARCH CAPITAL\n109\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nknown. Adjustments to premium estimates could be material and such adjustments could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined because the estimated premium may be fully or substantially earned. A significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable, which represent estimated premiums written, net of commissions, are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts.\nPremiums receivable\n include amounts receivable from agents, brokers and insured that are both currently due and amounts not yet due on insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance policies. Premiums receivable balances are reported net of an allowance for expected credit losses. The Company monitors credit risk associated with premiums receivable through its ongoing review of amounts outstanding, aging of the receivable, historical loss data, and counterparty financial strength measures. The allowance also includes estimated uncollectible amounts related to dispute risk. In certain instances, credit risk may be reduced by the Company’s right to offset loss obligations or unearned premiums against premiums receivable. \nAny allowance for credit losses is charged to net realized gains (losses) in the period the receivable is recorded and revised in subsequent periods to reflect changes in the Company’s estimate of expected credit losses.\n \nSee \nnote \n7\n,\n for additional information.\nAcquisition Costs.\n \nAcquisition costs that are directly related and incremental to the successful acquisition or renewal of business are deferred and amortized based on the type of contract. The Company’s insurance and reinsurance operations capitalize incremental direct external costs that result from acquiring a contract but do not capitalize salaries, benefits and other internal underwriting costs. For the Company’s mortgage insurance operations, which include a substantial direct sales force, both external and certain internal direct costs are deferred and amortized. For property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts, deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Consistent with mortgage insurance industry accounting practice, amortization of acquisition costs related to the mortgage insurance contracts for each underwriting year’s book of business is recorded in proportion to estimated gross profits. Estimated gross profits are comprised of earned premiums and losses and loss adjustment expenses. For each underwriting year, the Company estimates the rate of amortization to reflect actual experience and any changes to persistency or loss development. \nDeferred acquisition costs are carried at their estimated realizable value and take into account anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, based on historical and current experience, and anticipated investment income. \nA premium deficiency occurs if the sum of anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceed unearned premiums (including expected future premiums) and anticipated investment income. A premium deficiency reserve (“PDR”) is recorded by charging any unamortized acquisition costs to expense to the extent required in order to eliminate the deficiency. If the premium deficiency exceeds unamortized acquisition costs then a liability is accrued for the excess deficiency. \nTo assess the need for a PDR on mortgage exposures, the Company develops loss projections based on modeled loan defaults related to its current policies in force. This projection is based on recent trends in default experience, severity and rates of defaulted loans moving to claim, as well as recent trends in the rate at which loans are prepaid, and incorporates anticipated interest income. Evaluating the expected profitability of the Company’s existing mortgage insurance business and the need for a PDR for its mortgage business involves significant reliance upon assumptions and estimates with regard to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of potential losses and premium revenues. No premium deficiency charges were recorded by the Company during 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n(c) Deposit Accounting\nCertain assumed reinsurance contracts that are deemed not to transfer insurance risk, are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting. However, it is possible that the Company could incur financial losses on such contracts. Management exercises significant judgment in the assumptions used in determining whether assumed contracts should be accounted for as reinsurance contracts or deposit contracts. For those contracts that contain only significant underwriting risk, the estimated profit margin is deferred and amortized over the contract period and such amount is included in the Company’s underwriting results. When the estimated profit margin is explicit, the margin is reflected as other underwriting income and any adverse financial results on such contracts are reflected as incurred losses. When the estimated profit margin is implicit, the margin is reflected as an offset to paid losses and any adverse financial results on such contracts are reflected as incurred losses. Additional judgments are required when applying the accounting guidance with respect to the revenue recognition criteria for contracts deemed to transfer only significant underwriting risk. For those contracts that contain only significant timing risk, an accretion rate is established at inception of the contract based on actuarial estimates whereby the deposit accounting liability is increased to the estimated amount payable over the contract term. The accretion on the deposit is based on the expected rate of return required to fund the expected future payment obligations. Periodically the Company reassesses the estimated ultimate liability and the related expected rate of return. The accretion of the deposit \nARCH CAPITAL\n110\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\naccounting liability as well as changes to the estimated ultimate liability and the accretion rate would be reflected as part of interest expense in the Company’s results of operations. Any negative accretion in a deposit accounting liability is shown in other underwriting income in the Company’s results of operations. \nUnder some of these contracts, the ceding company retains the related assets on a funds held basis. Such amounts are included in “Other assets” on the Company’s balance sheet. Interest income produced by those assets are recorded as part of net investment income in the Company's results of operations.\n(d) Retroactive Reinsurance\nRetroactive reinsurance reimburses a ceding company for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events covered by the underlying policies reinsured. In certain instances, reinsurance contracts cover losses both on a prospective basis and on a retroactive basis and, accordingly, the Company bifurcates the prospective and retrospective elements of these reinsurance contracts and accounts for each element separately where practical. Underwriting income generated in connection with retroactive reinsurance contracts is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period while losses are charged to income immediately. Subsequent changes in estimated amount or timing of cash flows under such retroactive reinsurance contracts are accounted for by adjusting the previously deferred amount to the balance that would have existed had the revised estimate been available at the inception of the reinsurance transaction, with a corresponding charge or credit to income.\n(e) Reinsurance Ceded\nIn the normal course of business, the Company purchases reinsurance to increase capacity and to limit the impact of individual losses and events on its underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers. The Company uses pro rata, excess of loss and facultative reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance ceding commissions that represent a recovery of acquisition costs are recognized as a reduction to acquisition costs while the remaining portion is deferred. The accompanying consolidated statement of income reflects premiums and losses and loss adjustment expenses and acquisition costs, net of reinsurance ceded.\n See \nnote 8,\n for information on the Company's reinsurance usage. \nReinsurance premiums ceded and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable are estimated in a manner consistent with that of the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. If the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements, the Company’s insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries would be liable for such defaulted amounts.\nReinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets, predicated on the reinsurers’ ability to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements. In certain instances, the Company obtains collateral, including letters of credit and trust accounts to further reduce the credit exposure on its reinsurance recoverables. The Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for expected credit loss. The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, the financial condition of its reinsurers, amounts and form of collateral obtained and other relevant factors. A ratings based probability-of-default and loss-given-default methodology is used to estimate the allowance for expected credit loss. Any allowance for credit losses is charged to net realized gains (losses) in the period the recoverable is recorded and revised in s\nubsequent periods to reflect changes in the Company’s estimate of expected credit losses\n.\n See \nnote 7,\n for additional information.\n(f) Cash\nCash includes cash equivalents, which are investments with original maturities of three months or less which are not part of the investment portfolio.\n(g) Restricted Cash\nRestricted cash represents amounts held for the benefit of third parties or is legally or contractually restricted as to withdrawal or usage by the Company. Such amounts are included in “Other assets” on the Company’s balance sheet.\n(h) Investments\nThe Company currently classifies substantially all of its fixed maturity investments and short-term investments as “available for sale” and, accordingly, they are carried at estimated fair value (also known as fair value) with the changes in fair value recorded as an unrealized gain or loss component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The fair value of fixed maturity securities and equity securities is generally determined from quotations received from nationally recognized pricing services, or when such prices are not available, by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications. Short-term investments comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of issue. Short-term investments include certain cash equivalents which are part of investment portfolios under the management of external and internal investment managers.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio includes certain funds that, due to their ownership structure, are accounted for by the Company using the equity method. In applying the equity method, these investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on the Company’s \nARCH CAPITAL\n111\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nproportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds (which include changes in the fair value of the underlying securities in the funds). Such investments are generally recorded on a \none\n to \nthree month\n lag based on the availability of reports from the investment funds. Changes in the carrying value of such investments are recorded in net income as “Equity in net income (loss) of investments accounted for using the equity method.” As such, fluctuations in the carrying value of the investments accounted for using the equity method may increase the volatility of the Company’s reported results of operations.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio includes equity securities that are accounted for at fair value. Such holdings primarily include publicly traded common stocks. Dividend income on equities is reflected in net investment income. Changes in fair value on equity securities are included in “Net realized gains (losses)” in the consolidated statement of income.\nThe Company elected to carry certain fixed maturity securities, equity securities, short-term investments and other investments at fair value under the fair value option afforded by accounting guidance regarding the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities. The fair value for certain of the Company’s other investments are determined using net asset values (“NAVs”) as advised by external fund managers. The NAV is based on the fund manager’s valuation of the underlying holdings in accordance with the fund’s governing documents.\nChanges in fair value of investments accounted for using the fair value option are included in “Net realized gains (losses).” The primary reasons for electing the fair value option were to address simplification and cost-benefit considerations.\nThe Company invests in reverse repurchase agreements that are generally treated as collateralized receivables. Receivables for reverse repurchase agreements are reflected in “Other investments” or “Short-term investments” in the Company's consolidated balance sheet depending on their terms. These agreements are recorded at their contracted resale amount plus accrued interest, other than those that are accounted for at fair value. In reverse repurchase transactions, the Company obtains an interest in the purchased assets that are received as collateral.\nThe Company invests in limited partner interests and shares of limited liability companies. Such amounts are included in investments accounted for using the equity method and other investments. These investments can often have characteristics of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). A VIE refers to entities that have characteristics such as (i) insufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support or (ii) instances where the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of a controlling \nfinancial interest. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, it is required to consolidate the VIE. The primary beneficiary is defined as the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest as a result of having both (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. At inception of the VIE as well as on an ongoing basis, the Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary based on an analysis of the Company’s level of involvement in the VIE, the contractual terms, and the overall structure of the VIE. The Company's maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheet and any unfunded commitment.\nThe Company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate credit based impairments related to the Company’s available for sale investments. The Company derives estimated credit losses by comparing expected future cash flows to be collected to the amortized cost of the security. Estimates of expected future cash flows consider among other things, macroeconomic conditions as well as the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, and the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest. Effective January 1, 2020, credit losses are recognized through an allowance account subject to reversal, rather than a reduction in amortized cost. Declines in value attributable to factors other than credit are reported as an unrealized loss in other comprehensive income while the allowance for credit loss is charged to net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of income.\nFor available for sale investments that the Company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized gains (losses). The new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis reduced by the impairment recognized in net realized gains (losses). The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value. \nThe Company reports accrued investment income separately from investment balances and has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued investment income\n. \nAny uncollectible accrued interest income is written off in the period it is deemed uncollectible.\nNet investment income includes interest and dividend income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts and is net of investment management and custody fees. Anticipated prepayments and expected maturities are used in applying the interest method for certain investments such as \nARCH CAPITAL\n112\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nmortgage and other asset-backed securities. When actual prepayments differ significantly from anticipated prepayments, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in such securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the security. Such adjustments, if any, are included in net investment income when determined.\nInvestment gains or losses realized on the sale of investments, except for certain fund investments, are determined on a first-in, first-out basis and are reflected in net income. Investment gains or losses realized on the sale of certain fund investments are determined on an average cost basis. Unrealized appreciation or decline in the value of available for sale securities, which are carried at fair value, is excluded from net income and recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable deferred income tax.\n(i) Derivative Instruments\nThe Company recognizes all derivative instruments, including embedded derivative instruments, at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company employs the use of derivative instruments within its operations to mitigate risks arising from assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies as well as part of its overall investment strategy. For such instruments, changes in assets and liabilities measured at fair value are recorded as “Net realized gains (losses)” in the consolidated statements of income. In addition, the Company’s derivative instruments include amounts related to underwriting activities where an insurance or reinsurance contract meets the accounting definition of a derivative instrument. For such contracts, changes in fair value are reflected in “Other underwriting income” in the consolidated statements of income as the underlying contract originates from the Company’s underwriting operations. For the periods ended 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company did not designate any derivative instruments as hedges under the relevant accounting guidance.\n See \nnote 11,\n for additional information.\n(j) Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nInsurance and Reinsurance. \nThe reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses consists of estimates of unpaid reported losses and loss adjustment expenses and estimates for losses incurred but not reported. The reserve for unpaid reported losses and loss adjustment expenses, established by management based on reports from ceding companies and claims from insureds, excludes estimates of amounts related to losses under high deductible policies, and represents the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have been reported to or specifically identified by the Company. Such \nreserves are supplemented by management’s estimates of reserves for losses incurred for which reports or claims have not been received. The Company’s reserves are based on a combination of reserving methods, incorporating both Company and industry loss development patterns. The Company selects the initial expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios based on information derived by its underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business, supplemented by industry data where appropriate. Such ratios consider, among other things, rate changes and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market. These estimates are reviewed regularly and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the reserves are adjusted as necessary. Such adjustments, if any, are reflected in income in the period in which they are determined. As actual loss information has been reported, the Company has developed its own loss experience and its reserving methods include other actuarial techniques. Over time, such techniques have been given further weight in its reserving process based on the continuing maturation of the Company’s reserves. Inherent in the estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are expected trends in claims severity and frequency and other factors which may vary significantly as claims are settled. Accordingly, ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Losses and loss adjustment expenses are recorded on an undiscounted basis, except for excess workers’ compensation and employers’ liability business written by the Company’s insurance operations.\nMortgage. \nThe reserves for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses are the estimated claim settlement costs on notices of delinquency that have been received by the Company, as well as loan delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by the lenders. Consistent with primary mortgage insurance industry accounting practice, the Company does not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently delinquent (defined as two or more payments in arrears). The Company establishes loss reserves on a case-by-case basis when insured loans are reported delinquent using estimated claim rates and average claim sizes for each cohort, net of any salvage recoverable. The Company also reserves for delinquencies that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company prior to the close of an accounting period. To determine this reserve, the Company estimates the number of delinquencies not yet reported using historical information regarding late reported delinquencies and applies estimated claim rates and claim sizes for the estimated delinquencies not yet reported.\nARCH CAPITAL\n113\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe establishment of reserves across the Company’s segments is an inherently uncertain process, are necessarily based on estimates, and the ultimate net cost may vary from such estimates. The methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting liability are reviewed and updated using the most current information available. Any resulting adjustments, which may be material, are reflected in current operations.\n(k) Contractholder Receivables and Payables and Collateral Held for Insured Obligations\nCertain insurance policies written by the Company’s U.S. insurance operations feature large deductibles, primarily in its construction and national accounts line of business. Under such contracts, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant for the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policy holder for the deductible amount. These amounts are included on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet as contractholder payables and contractholder receivables. In the event that the Company is unable to collect from the policyholder, the Company would be liable for such defaulted amounts. Collateral, primarily in the form of letters of credit, cash and trusts, is obtained from the policyholder to mitigate the Company’s credit risk. In the instances where the Company receives collateral in the form of cash, the Company reflects it in “Collateral held for insured obligations.”\nContractholder receivables are reported net of an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, changes in policyholder credit standing, amounts and form of collateral obtained, and other relevant factors. A ratings based probability-of-default and loss-given-default methodology is used to estimate the allowance for expected credit losses. \nAny allowance for credit losses is charged to net realized gains (losses) in the period the receivable is recorded and revised in subsequent periods to reflect changes in the Company’s estimate of expected credit losses\n.\n See \nnote 7,\n for additional information.\n(l) Foreign Exchange\nAssets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar are translated at the prevailing exchange rates at each balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The net effect of the translation adjustments for foreign operations is included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable deferred income tax. Monetary assets and liabilities, such as premiums receivable and the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses, denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses \nincluded in net income. Accounts that are classified as non-monetary, such as deferred acquisition costs and the unearned premium reserves, are not revalued. In the case of foreign currency denominated fixed maturity securities which are classified as “available for sale,” the change in exchange rates between the local currency in which the investments are denominated and the Company’s functional currency at each balance sheet date is included in unrealized appreciation or decline in value of securities, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable deferred income tax.\n(m) Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred income tax asset may not be realized. The Company considers future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event the Company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of its deferred income tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made. In addition, if the Company subsequently assesses that the valuation allowance is no longer needed, a benefit would be recorded to income in the period in which such determination is made.\n See \nnote 15,\n for additional information.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit where it concludes that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, the Company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in the Company’s judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.\nOn December 27, 2023 the Bermuda government enacted tax legislation referred to as the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (“Bermuda CIT Act”). The Bermuda CIT Act establishes a 15% corporate income tax, for in-scope businesses, for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The enacted legislation includes a provision referred to as the Economic Transition Adjustment, which requires Bermuda Constituent entities to establish tax basis in their assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, based on fair value as of September 30, 2023. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the \nARCH CAPITAL\n114\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nmeasurement date.\n See \nnote 15,\n for additional information regarding Company’s deferred income tax asset. \n(n) Share-Based Payment Arrangements\nThe Company applies a fair value based measurement method in accounting for its share-based payment arrangements with eligible employees and directors. Compensation expense is estimated based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and is recognized in net income over the requisite service period with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity. No value is attributed to awards that employees forfeit because they fail to satisfy vesting conditions. The Company’s (i) time-based awards generally vest over a \nthree year\n period with one-third vesting on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date and (ii) performance-based awards cliff vest after each \nthree year\n performance period based on achievement of the specified performance criteria. The share-based compensation expense associated with awards that have graded vesting features and vest based on service conditions only is calculated on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation expense recognized in connection with performance awards is based on the achievement of the specified performance and service conditions. The final measure of compensation expense recognized over the requisite service period reflects the final performance outcome. During the recognition period compensation expense is accrued based on the performance condition that is probable of achievement. For awards granted to retirement-eligible employees where no service is required for the employee to retain the award, the grant date fair value is immediately recognized as compensation expense at the grant date because the employee is able to retain the award without continuing to provide service. For employees near retirement eligibility, attribution of compensation cost is over the period from the grant date to the retirement eligibility date. These charges had no impact on the Company’s cash flows or total shareholders’ equity.\n See \nnote 22,\n for information relating to the Company’s share-based payment awards.\n(o) Guaranty Fund and Other Related Assessments\nLiabilities for guaranty fund and other related assessments in the Company’s insurance and reinsurance operations are accrued when the Company receives notice that an amount is payable, or earlier if a reasonable estimate of the assessment can be made.\n(p) Treasury Shares\nTreasury shares are common shares purchased by the Company and not subsequently canceled. These shares are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of the Company’s shareholders’ equity in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(q) Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business combination over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is assigned to the applicable reporting unit at acquisition. The annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of October 1, 2024. Impairment tests may be performed more frequently if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. In performing impairment tests, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, more than a 50% probability) that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform goodwill impairment test described in the accounting guidance. \nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as insurance licenses are evaluated for impairment similar to goodwill. Finite-lived intangible assets and liabilities include the value of acquired insurance and reinsurance contracts, which are estimated based on the present value of future expected cash flows and amortized in proportion to the estimated profits expected to be realized. Other finite-lived intangible assets, including customer lists, trade name and IT platforms, are amortized over their useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets and liabilities are periodically reviewed for indicators of impairment. An impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.\nIf goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, such assets are written down to their fair values with the related expense recorded in the Company’s results of operations.\n(r) Investment in Operating Affiliates\nInvestment in operating affiliates primarily represent the Company’s investments in which it has significant influence and which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In applying the equity method of accounting, investments in operating affiliates are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on the Company’s proportionate share of net income or loss of the operating affiliate. The Company records its proportionate share of other comprehensive income or loss of the operating affiliate as a component of other comprehensive income. Adjustments are based on the most recently available financial information from the operating affiliate. Changes in the carrying value of these investments are recorded in income (loss) from operating affiliates.\nARCH CAPITAL\n115\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(s) Funds Held Arrangements\nFunds held arrangements are agreements with a third party reinsurance company, where the reinsured retains the related assets on a funds held basis. Such amounts are included in “Other assets” on the Company’s balance sheet. Investment returns produced by those assets are recorded as part of net investment income and net realized gains (losses) in the Company's consolidated results of operations. Funds held as collateral by the Company are included in “Other liabilities” and changes to the funds held liability are reflected as part of interest expense in the Company’s consolidated results of operations.\n(t) Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted\nThe Company adopted ASU 2020-04, “Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,” which was issued in March 2020 and amended in December 2022 with ASU 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)”. This ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to investments, derivatives, or other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate \nexpected\n to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Along with the optional expedients, the amendments include a general principle that permits an entity to consider contract modifications due to reference reform to be an event that does not require contract re-measurement at the modification date or reassessment of a previous accounting determination. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting – Improvements to Reportable Segments Disclosures,” which was issued in November 2023. This ASU enhances public entities’ segment disclosures by requiring the disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The ASU also extends certain annual disclosures to interim periods and allows the reporting of more than one measure of segment profit or loss under certain conditions. The adoption of this ASU did not have any effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nASU 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” was issued in December 2023 with the stated purpose of enhancing the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 address investor requests for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. While early adoption is permitted, a public entity should apply the amendments in ASU 2023-09 prospectively to all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nASU 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” was issued in November 2024, which requires disaggregated disclosure of income statement expenses for public business entities. The ASU does not change the expense captions an entity presents on the face of the income statement; rather, it requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into specified categories in disclosures within the footnotes to the financial statements. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The requirements will be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective application. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nARCH CAPITAL\n116\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n4.    Segment Information\nThe Company classifies its businesses into \nthree\n segments – insurance, reinsurance and mortgage. The Company determined its segments using the management approach described in accounting guidance regarding disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used for the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Intersegment business is allocated to the segment accountable for the underwriting results.\nThe Company’s insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments each have managers who are responsible for the overall profitability of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to the Company’s CODMs, the Chief Executive Officer of Arch Capital and the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Arch Capital. The CODMs do not assess performance, measure return on equity or make resource allocation decisions on a line of business basis. Management measures segment performance for its \nthree\n segments based on underwriting income or loss. The Company does not manage its assets by segment, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, and, accordingly, investment income is not allocated to each underwriting segment. \nThe Company’s insurance segment primarily consists of commercial insurance lines of business, with a focus on specialty insurance products. These products are mainly offered in North America, Bermuda, the United Kingdom, continental Europe and Australia. Products offered in North America include: commercial automobile; commercial multiperil; other liability—claims made, which includes financial and professional lines; other liability—occurrence, which includes admitted and excess and surplus casualty lines; property and short-tail specialty; workers compensation; and other. Products offered across the Company’s International units include: property and short-tail specialty; and casualty and other.\nThe Company’s reinsurance segment offers reinsurance products on a worldwide basis. Product lines of business include: casualty; marine and aviation; other specialty; property catastrophe; property excluding property catastrophe; and other.\nThe Company’s mortgage segment consists of U.S. primary mortgage insurance business written predominantly on loans sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), each a government sponsored entity (“GSE”) and also through non GSE approved entities (combined “Arch MI U.S.”); reinsurance and underwriting services related to U.S. credit-risk transfer (“CRT”) business which are predominately with the GSEs and other U.S. mortgage reinsurance transactions; and international mortgage insurance and reinsurance business covering loans primarily in Australia and Europe.\nThe Company’s results also include net investment income, net realized gains or losses (which includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains or losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries), equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, other income (loss), corporate expenses, transaction costs and other, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, net foreign exchange gains or losses, income tax items, income or loss from operating affiliates and items related to the Company’s non-cumulative preferred shares.\nARCH CAPITAL\n117\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

Net adverse development in long-tailed lines included $\n5\n million in casualty, spread across many prior underwriting years.\nThe mortgage segment’s favorable development was driven by reserve releases related to COVID-19 delinquencies associated with the U.S. first lien portfolio from the 2020 and 2021 accident years. The Company’s credit risk transfer, international, second lien and student loan businesses also contributed to the favorable development.\nARCH CAPITAL\n123\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

The Company considered such information in determining the level of disaggregation for disclosures related to its short-duration contracts, as detailed in the table below:\nReportable segment\nLevel of disaggregation\nIncluded lines of business\nInsurance\nProperty energy, marine and aviation\nProperty energy, marine and aviation\nThird party occurrence business\nExcess and surplus casualty (excluding contract binding); construction and national accounts; and other (including \nalternative market risks, excess workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance coverages)\nThird party claims-made business\nProfessional lines\nMulti-line and other specialty\nPrograms; contract binding (part of excess and surplus casualty); travel, accident and health; warranty and lenders solutions; and other (c\nontract and commercial surety coverages); MCE business\n1\nReinsurance\nCasualty\nCasualty\nProperty catastrophe\nProperty catastrophe\nProperty excluding property catastrophe\nProperty excluding property catastrophe\nMarine and aviation\nMarine and aviation\nOther specialty\nOther specialty\nMortgage\nDirect mortgage insurance in the U.S.\nMortgage insurance on U.S. primary exposures\n(1) Includes business underwritten under a new business reinsurance agreement related to the MCE Acquisition. See \nnote 2\n.\nThe Company dete\nrmined the following to be insignificant for disclosure purposes: \n(i) certain mortgage business, including non-U.S. primary business, second lien and student loan exposures, global mortgage reinsurance and participation in various GSE credit risk-sharing products and (ii) certain reinsurance business, including casualty clash and non-traditional lines. Such amounts are included as \nreconciling items.\nThe Company is\n required to establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses (“Loss Reserves”) that arise from the business the Company underwrites. Loss Reserves for the insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments represent estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured events which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date. Loss Reserves do not reflect contingency reserve allowances to account for future loss occurrences. Losses arising from \nfuture events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial.\nInsurance Segment\nLoss Reserves for the insurance segment are comprised of estimated amounts for (1) reported losses (“case reserves”) and (2) incurred but not reported losses (“IBNR reserves”). Generally, claims personnel determine whether to establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate settlement of individual claims. The estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general corporate reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim and, where appropriate, advice of counsel. The Company also contracts with a number of outside third party administrators in the claims process who, in certain cases, have limited authority to establish case reserves. The work of such administrators is reviewed and monitored by our claims personnel. Loss Reserves are also established to provide for loss adjustment expenses and represent the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process. Periodically, adjustments to the case reserves may be made as additional information is reported or payments are made. IBNR reserves are established to provide for incurred claims which have not yet been reported at the balance sheet date as well as to adjust for any projected variance in case reserving. Actuaries estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information. Like case reserves, IBNR reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and, as of any given date, is inherently uncertain.\nUltimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are generally determined by projection of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future. In forecasting ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to any line of business, past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource, developed through both industry and company experience, but cannot be relied upon in isolation. Uncertainties in estimating ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are magnified by the length of the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled. This time lag is sometimes referred to as the “claim-tail.” During this period additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years, as well as about actual claims and trends, may become known and, as a result, may lead to adjustments of the related Loss Reserves. If the Company determines that an adjustment is appropriate, the adjustment is recorded in the accounting period in which such determination is made. Accordingly, should Loss \nARCH CAPITAL\n124\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established, future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted respectively. The Company authorizes managing general agents, general agents and other producers to write program business on the Company’s behalf within prescribed underwriting authorities. This delegated authority process introduces additional complexity to the actuarial determination of unpaid future losses and loss adjustment expenses. In order to monitor adherence to the underwriting guidelines given to such parties, the Company periodically performs underwriting and claims due diligence reviews.\nIn determining ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses, the cost to indemnify claimants, provide needed legal defense and other services for insureds and administer the investigation and adjustment of claims are considered. These claim costs are influenced by many factors that change over time, such as expanded coverage definitions as a result of new court decisions, inflation in costs to repair or replace damaged property, inflation in the cost of medical services and legislated changes in statutory benefits, as well as by the particular, unique facts that pertain to each claim. As a result, the rate at which claims arose in the past and the costs to settle them may not always be representative of what will occur in the future. The factors influencing changes in claim costs are often difficult to isolate or quantify and developments in paid and incurred losses from historical trends are frequently subject to multiple and conflicting interpretations. Changes in coverage terms or claims handling practices may also cause future experience and/or development patterns to vary from the past. A key objective of actuaries in developing estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses, and resulting IBNR reserves, is to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and adjust for them so that the future can be projected more reliably. Because of the factors previously discussed, this process requires the substantial use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain.\nAlthough Loss Reserves are initially determined based on underwriting and pricing analyses, the Company’s insurance segment applies several generally accepted actuarial methods, as discussed below, on a quarterly basis to evaluate the Loss Reserves, in addition to the expected loss method, in particular for Loss Reserves from more mature accident years (the year in which a loss occurred). Each quarter, as part of the reserving process, the segments’ actuaries reaffirm that the assumptions used in the reserving process continue to form a sound basis for the projection of liabilities. If actual loss activity differs substantially from expectations based on historical information, an adjustment to Loss Reserves may be supported. The Company places more or less reliance on a particular actuarial method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the estimates of Loss Reserves are made. \nThese methods generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:\n•\nExpected loss methods\n - these methods are based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums. Expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios are typically developed based upon the information derived by underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business, supplemented by industry data available from organizations, such as statistical bureaus and consulting firms, where appropriate. These ratios consider, among other things, rate increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market. Expected loss methods are useful for estimating ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses in the early years of long-tailed lines of business, when little or no paid or incurred loss information is available, and is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists for a company.\n•\nHistorical incurred loss development methods \n- these methods assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future. These methods use incurred losses (\ni.e.\n, the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves) over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses. Historical incurred loss development methods may be preferable to historical paid loss development methods because they explicitly take into account open cases and the claims adjusters’ evaluations of the cost to settle all known claims. However, historical incurred loss development methods necessarily assume that case reserving practices are consistently applied over time. Therefore, when there have been significant changes in how case reserves are established, using incurred loss data to project ultimate losses may be less reliable than other methods.\n•\nHistorical paid loss development methods \n- these methods, like historical incurred loss development methods, assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant. These methods use historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses and necessarily assume that factors that have affected paid losses in the past, such as inflation or the effects of litigation, will remain constant in the future. Because historical paid loss development methods do not use incurred losses to estimate ultimate losses, they may be more reliable than the other methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how incurred losses are established by a company’s claims adjusters. However, historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged (meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses) than \nARCH CAPITAL\n125\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nactuarial methods that use incurred losses because cumulative loss payments take much longer to equal the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts. In addition, and for similar reasons, historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past.\n•\nAdjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods \n- these methods take traditional historical paid and incurred loss development methods and adjust them for the estimated impact of changes from the past in factors such as inflation, the speed of claim payments or the adequacy of case reserves. Adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods are often more reliable methods of predicting ultimate losses in periods of significant change, provided the actuaries can develop methods to reasonably quantify the impact of changes. As such, these methods utilize more judgment than historical paid and incurred loss development methods.\n•\nBornhuetter-Ferguson (“B-F”) paid and incurred loss methods \n- these methods utilize actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of expected ultimate losses. The B-F paid and incurred loss methods are useful when there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses.\n•\nFrequency-Severity methods \n- These methods utilize actual paid and incurred claim experience, but break the data down into its component pieces: claim counts, often expressed as a ratio to exposure or premium (frequency), and average claim size (severity). The component pieces are projected to an ultimate level and multiplied together to result in an estimate of ultimate loss. These methods are especially useful when the severity of claims can be confined to a relatively stable range of estimated ultimate average claim value.\n•\nAdditional analyses \n- other methodologies are often used in the reserving process for specific types of claims or events, such as catastrophic or other specific major events. These include vendor catastrophe models, which are typically used in the estimation of Loss Reserves at the early stage of known catastrophic events before information has been reported to an insurer or reinsurer. \nIn the initial reserving process for short-tail insurance lines (consisting of property, energy, marine and aviation and other exposures including travel, accident and health, and warranty and lenders solutions), the Company relies on a combination of the reserving methods discussed above. For catastrophe-exposed business, the reserving process also includes the usage of catastrophe models for known events \nand a heavy reliance on analysis of individual catastrophic events and management judgment. The development of losses on short-tail business can be unstable, especially for policies characterized by high severity, low frequency losses. As time passes, for a given accident year, additional weight is given to the paid and incurred B-F loss development methods and eventually to the historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process. The Company makes a number of key assumptions in their reserving process, including that historical paid and reported development patterns are stable, catastrophe models provide useful information about our exposure to catastrophic events that have occurred and underwriters’ judgment as to potential loss exposures can be relied on. The expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for short-tail business have varied over time due to changes in pricing, reinsurance structure, estimates of catastrophe losses, policy changes (such as attachment points, class and limits) and geographical distribution. As losses in short-tail lines are reported relatively quickly, expected loss ratios are selected for the current accident year based upon actual attritional loss ratios for earlier accident years, adjusted for rate changes, inflation, changes in reinsurance programs and expected attritional losses based on modeling. Furthermore, ultimate losses for short-tail business are known in a reasonably short period of time.\nIn the initial reserving process for long-tail insurance lines\n (\nconsisting of\n \nthird party occurrence business, third party claims made business, and other exposures including surety, programs and contract binding exposures), the Company primarily relies on the expected loss method. The development of the Company’s long-tail business may be unstable, especially if there are high severity major events, as a portion of the Company’s casualty business is in high excess layers. As time passes, for a given accident year, additional weight is given to the paid and incurred B-F loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process. The Company makes a number of key assumptions in reserving for long-tail lines, including that the pricing loss ratio is the best estimate of the ultimate loss ratio at the time the policy is entered into, that the loss development patterns, which are based on a combination of company and industry loss development patterns and adjusted to reflect differences in the insurance segment’s mix of business, are reasonable and that claims personnel and underwriters analyses of our exposure to major events are assumed to be the best estimate of exposure to the known claims on those events. The expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for long-tail business for recent accident years have varied over time, in some cases significantly, from earlier accident years. As the credibility of historical experience for earlier accident years increases, the experience from these accident years will be given a greater weighting in the actuarial analysis to determine future \nARCH CAPITAL\n126\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\naccident year expected loss ratios, adjusted for changes in pricing, loss trends, terms and conditions and reinsurance structure. \nFrom time to time, the Company enters into loss portfolio transfer and adverse development cover reinsurance agreements accounted for as retroactive reinsurance. These agreements transfer Loss Reserves and future favorable or adverse development on certain runoff programs and certain third party occurrence business, within multi-line and other specialty business (the “Covered Lines”). As incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for the Covered Lines \nare ceded to the reinsurer, the Company is not exposed to changes in the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from the Covered Lines.

The Company receives reports of claims notices from ceding companies and records case reserves based upon the amount of reserves recommended by the ceding company. Case reserves may be supplemented by ACRs, which may be estimated by the Company’s claims personnel ahead of official notification from the ceding company, or when judgment regarding the size or severity of the known event differs from the ceding company. In certain instances, the Company establishes ACRs even when the ceding company does not report any liability on a known event. In addition, specific claim information reported by ceding companies or obtained through claim audits can alert the Company to emerging trends such as changing legal interpretations of coverage and liability, claims from unexpected sources or classes of \nbusiness, and significant changes in the frequency or severity of individual claims. Such information is often used in the process of estimating IBNR reserves. \nIBNR reserves are established to provide for incurred claims which have not yet been reported at the balance sheet date as well as to adjust for any projected variance in case reserving. Actuaries estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information. Like case reserves, IBNR reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The process of estimating Loss Reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and, as of any given date, is inherently uncertain.\nThe estimation of Loss Reserves for the reinsurance segment is subject to the same risk factors as the estimation of Loss Reserves for the insurance segment. In addition, the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for \nARCH CAPITAL\n129\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nreinsurers, due primarily to the following factors: (1) the claim-tail for reinsurers is generally longer because claims are first reported to the ceding company and then to the reinsurer through one or more intermediaries, (2) the reliance on premium estimates, where reports have not been received from the ceding company, in the reserving process, (3) the potential for writing a number of reinsurance contracts with different ceding companies with the same exposure to a single loss event, (4) the diversity of loss development patterns among different types of reinsurance contracts, (5) the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and (6) the differing reserving practices among ceding companies.\nUltimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are generally determined by projection of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future. As with the insurance segment, the process of estimating Loss Reserves for the reinsurance segment involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and, as of any given date, is inherently uncertain. As discussed above, such uncertainty is greater for reinsurers compared to insurers. As a result, our reinsurance operations obtain information from numerous sources to assist in the process. Pricing actuaries from the reinsurance segment devote considerable effort to understanding and analyzing a ceding company’s operations and loss history during the underwriting of the business, using a combination of ceding company and industry statistics. Such statistics normally include historical premium and loss data by class of business, individual claim information for larger claims, distributions of insurance limits provided, loss reporting and payment patterns, and rate change history. This analysis is used to project expected loss ratios for each treaty during the upcoming contract period.\nAs mentioned above, there can be a considerable time lag from the time a claim is reported to a ceding company to the time it is reported to the reinsurer. The lag can be several years in some cases and may be attributed to a number of reasons, including the time it takes to investigate a claim, delays associated with the litigation process, the deterioration in a claimant’s physical condition many years after an accident occurs, the case reserving approach of the ceding company, etc. In the reserving process, the Company assumes that such lags are predictable, on average, over time and therefore the lags are contemplated in the loss reporting patterns used in their actuarial methods. This means that the reinsurance segment must rely on estimates for a longer period of time than does an insurance company. Backlogs in the recording of assumed reinsurance can also complicate the accuracy of loss reserve estimation. As of December 31, 2024 there were no significant backlogs related to the processing of assumed reinsurance information at our reinsurance operations.\nThe reinsurance segment relies heavily on information reported by ceding companies, as discussed above. In order to determine the accuracy and completeness of such information, underwriters, actuaries, and claims personnel often perform audits of ceding companies and regularly review information received from ceding companies for unusual or unexpected results. Material findings are usually discussed with the ceding companies. The Company sometimes encounters situations where they determine that a claim presentation from a ceding company is not in accordance with contract terms. In these situations, the Company attempts to resolve the dispute with the ceding company. Most situations are resolved amicably and without the need for litigation or arbitration. However, in the infrequent situations where a resolution is not possible, the Company will vigorously defend its position in such disputes.\nAlthough Loss Reserves are initially determined based on underwriting and pricing analysis, the Company applies several generally accepted actuarial methods, as discussed above, on a quarterly basis to evaluate its Loss Reserves in addition to the expected loss method, in particular for reserves from more mature underwriting years (the year in which business is underwritten). Each quarter, as part of the reserving process, the Company’s actuaries reaffirm that the assumptions used in the reserving process continue to form a sound basis for projection of liabilities. If actual loss activity differs substantially from expectations based on historical information, an adjustment to Loss Reserves may be supported. Estimated Loss Reserves for more mature underwriting years are now based more on actual loss activity and historical patterns than on the initial assumptions based on pricing indications. More recent underwriting years rely more heavily on internal pricing assumptions. The Company places more or less reliance on a particular actuarial method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the estimates of Loss Reserves are made.\nIn the initial reserving process for short-tail reinsurance lines (consisting of property excluding property catastrophe and property catastrophe exposures), the Company relies on a combination of the reserving methods discussed above. For known catastrophic events, the reserving process also includes the usage of catastrophe models and a heavy reliance on analysis which includes ceding company inquiries and management judgment. The development of property losses may be unstable, especially where there is high catastrophic exposure, may be characterized by high severity, low frequency losses for excess and catastrophe-exposed business and may be highly correlated across contracts. As time passes, for a given underwriting year, additional weight is given to the paid and incurred B-F loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process. The Company makes a number of key assumptions in reserving for short-tail lines, including that historical paid and reported development \nARCH CAPITAL\n130\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\npatterns are stable, catastrophe models provide useful information about our exposure to catastrophic events that have occurred and our underwriters’ judgment and guidance received from ceding companies as to potential loss exposures may be relied on. The expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for property exposures have varied over time due to changes in pricing, reinsurance structure, estimates of catastrophe losses, terms and conditions and geographical distribution. As losses in property lines are reported relatively quickly, expected loss ratios are selected for the current underwriting year incorporating the experience for earlier underwriting years, adjusted for rate changes, inflation, changes in reinsurance programs, expectations about present and future market conditions and expected attritional losses based on modeling. Due to the short-tail nature of property business, reported loss experience emerges quickly and ultimate losses are known in a reasonably short period of time.\nIn the initial reserving process for long-tail reinsurance lines (consisting of casualty, other specialty, marine and aviation and other exposures), the Company primarily relies on the expected loss method. The development of long-tail business may be unstable, especially if there are high severity major \nevents, with business written on an excess of loss basis typically having a longer tail than business written on a pro rata basis. As time passes, for a given underwriting year, additional weight is given to the paid and incurred B-F loss development methods and eventually to the historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process. Our reinsurance operations make a number of key assumptions in reserving for long-tail lines, including that the pricing loss ratio is the best estimate of the ultimate loss ratio at the time the contract is entered into, historical paid and reported development patterns are stable and claims personnel and underwriters’ analyses of our exposure to major events are our best estimate of our exposure to the known claims on those events. The expected loss ratios used in our reinsurance operations’ initial reserving process for long-tail contracts have varied over time due to changes in pricing, terms and conditions and reinsurance structure. As the credibility of historical experience for earlier underwriting years increases, the experience from these underwriting years is used in the actuarial analysis to determine future underwriting year expected loss ratios, adjusted for changes in pricing, loss trends, terms and conditions and reinsurance structure.\nThe following tables present information on the reinsurance segment’s short-duration insurance contracts:\nCasualty (in millions)\nIncurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance\nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal of IBNR liabilities plus expected development on reported claims\nCumulative \nnumber of reported claims\nYear ended December 31,\nAccident year\n2015\nunaudited\n2016\nunaudited\n2017\nunaudited\n2018\nunaudited\n2019\nunaudited\n2020\nunaudited\n2021\nunaudited\n2022\nunaudited\n2023\nunaudited\n2024\n2015\n$\n218\n \n$\n217\n \n$\n225\n \n$\n232\n \n$\n236\n \n$\n243\n \n$\n246\n \n$\n248\n \n$\n257\n \n$\n248\n \n$\n37\n \nN/A\n2016\n209\n \n222\n \n244\n \n259\n \n266\n \n266\n \n269\n \n278\n \n279\n \n43\n \nN/A\n2017\n264\n \n252\n \n268\n \n295\n \n306\n \n313\n \n327\n \n335\n \n49\n \nN/A\n2018\n273\n \n286\n \n278\n \n283\n \n295\n \n304\n \n318\n \n49\n \nN/A\n2019\n328\n \n340\n \n367\n \n378\n \n399\n \n398\n \n72\n \nN/A\n2020\n377\n \n365\n \n348\n \n366\n \n385\n \n128\n \nN/A\n2021\n436\n \n431\n \n422\n \n423\n \n157\n \nN/A\n2022\n542\n \n523\n \n535\n \n312\n \nN/A\n2023\n650\n \n654\n \n438\n \nN/A\n2024\n720\n \n680\n \nN/A\nTotal\n$\n4,295\n \nCumulative paid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance\n2015\n$\n4\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n71\n \n$\n96\n \n$\n119\n \n$\n136\n \n$\n151\n \n$\n169\n \n$\n177\n \n2016\n6\n \n26\n \n51\n \n86\n \n113\n \n132\n \n156\n \n172\n \n186\n \n2017\n6\n \n30\n \n64\n \n113\n \n137\n \n164\n \n188\n \n221\n \n2018\n8\n \n31\n \n106\n \n129\n \n154\n \n182\n \n205\n \n2019\n16\n \n58\n \n97\n \n130\n \n219\n \n256\n \n2020\n18\n \n50\n \n90\n \n131\n \n177\n \n2021\n14\n \n53\n \n102\n \n190\n \n2022\n17\n \n60\n \n111\n \n2023\n18\n \n86\n \n2024\n14\n \nTotal\n1,623\n \nAll outstanding liabilities before 2015, net of reinsurance\n354\n \nLiabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance\n$\n3,026\n \nARCH CAPITAL\n131\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

The latter two categories along with second lien and student loan exposures are excluded on the basis of insignificance for the purposes of presenting disclosures related to short duration contracts.\nFor primary mortgage insurance business, the Company establishes case reserves for loans that have been reported as delinquent by loan servicers as well as those that are delinquent but not reported (IBNR reserves). The Company also reserves for the expenses of adjusting claims related to these delinquencies. The trigger that creates a case reserve estimate is that an insured loan is reported to us as being two payments in arrears. The actuarial reviews and documentation created in the reserving process are completed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial standards. The selected assumptions reflect actuarial judgment based on the analysis of historical data and experience combined with information concerning current underwriting, economic, judicial, regulatory and other influences on ultimate claim settlements.\nBecause the reserving process requires the Company to forecast future conditions, it is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgment and estimation. The use of different estimates would result in the establishment of different reserve levels. Additionally, changes in estimates are likely to occur from period to period as economic conditions change, and the ultimate liability may vary significantly from the estimates used. Major risk factors include (but are not limited to) changes in home prices and borrower equity, which can limit the borrower’s ability to sell the property and satisfy the outstanding loan balance, and changes in unemployment, which can affect the borrower’s income and ability to make mortgage payments. The unique nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no historical precedent, adds further uncertainty to current reserve estimates.\nThe lead actuarial methodology used by the Company is a frequency-severity method based on the inventory of pending delinquencies. Each month the loan servicers report the delinquency status of each insured loan. Using the frequency-\nseverity method allows the Company to take advantage of its knowledge of the number of delinquent loans and the coverage provided (“risk size”) on those loans by directly relating the reserves to these amounts. The delinquencies are grouped into homogeneous cohorts for analysis, reflecting the age of delinquency. A claim rate is then developed for each cohort which represents the frequency with which the delinquencies become claims. The claim frequency rates are based on an analysis of the patterns of emerging cure counts and claim counts, the foreclosure status of the pending delinquencies, the product and geographical mix of the delinquencies and our view of future economic and claim conditions, which include trends in home prices and unemployment. Claim rates can vary materially by age of delinquency, depending on the mix of delinquencies and economic conditions.\nClaim size severity estimates are determined by examining the risk sizes on the delinquent loans and estimating the portion of risk that will be paid, as well as any expenses. This is done based on a review of historical development patterns, an assessment of economic conditions and the level of equity the borrowers may have in their homes, as well as considering economic conditions and loss mitigation opportunities. Mortgage insurance is generally not subject to large claim sizes, as with some other lines of insurance. A claim size over $\n250,000\n is rare, and this helps reduce the volatility of claim size estimates.\nThe claim rate and claim size assumptions generate case reserves for the population of reported delinquencies. The reserve for unreported delinquencies (included in IBNR reserves) is estimated by looking at historical patterns of reporting. Claim rates and claim sizes can then be assigned to estimated unreported delinquencies using assumptions made in the establishment of case reserves.\nMortgage insurance Loss Reserves are short-tail, in the sense that the vast majority of delinquencies are resolved within two years of being reported. Due to the forbearances and foreclosure moratoriums associated with COVID-19, settlement timelines have been extended. While reserves are initially analyzed by reserve cohort, as described above, they are also rolled up by underwriting year to ensure that reserve assumptions are consistent with the performance of the underwriting year. The accuracy of prior reserve assumptions \nARCH CAPITAL\n134\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

The Company’s reinsurance subsidiaries participate in “common account” retrocessional arrangements for certain pro rata treaties. Such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all companies participating on such treaties, including the reinsurers, such as the Company’s reinsurance subsidiaries, and the ceding company. In addition, the Company’s reinsurance subsidiaries may purchase retrocessional coverage as part of their risk management program. The Company’s mortgage subsidiaries cede a portion of their premium through quota share arrangements and enter into various aggregate excess of loss mortgage reinsurance agreements with various special purpose reinsurance companies. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets, predicated on the reinsurers’ ability to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements. If the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements, the Company’s insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries would be liable for such defaulted amounts.\nThe effects of reinsurance on the Company’s written and earned premiums and losses and loss adjustment expenses with unaffiliated reinsurers were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPremiums Written\nDirect\n$\n10,056\n \n$\n9,652\n \n$\n8,542\n \nAssumed\n11,455\n \n8,751\n \n6,785\n \nCeded\n(\n5,779\n)\n(\n4,935\n)\n(\n4,249\n)\nNet\n$\n15,732\n \n$\n13,468\n \n$\n11,078\n \nPremiums Earned\nDirect\n$\n9,721\n \n$\n9,131\n \n$\n8,058\n \nAssumed\n10,880\n \n7,890\n \n5,768\n \nCeded\n(\n5,501\n)\n(\n4,581\n)\n(\n4,147\n)\nNet\n$\n15,100\n \n$\n12,440\n \n$\n9,679\n \nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nDirect\n$\n5,676\n \n$\n4,739\n \n$\n3,991\n \nAssumed\n6,137\n \n3,975\n \n3,558\n \nCeded\n(\n3,471\n)\n(\n2,468\n)\n(\n2,521\n)\nNet\n$\n8,342\n \n$\n6,246\n \n$\n5,028\n \nARCH CAPITAL\n137\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

Such investments are generally recorded on a \none\n to \nthree month\n lag based on the availability of reports from the investment funds. \nEquity in Net Income (Loss) of Investments Accounted For Using the Equity Method\nThe Company recorded equity in net income related to investments accounted for using the equity method of $\n580\n million for 2024, compared to $\n278\n million for 2023 and $\n115\n million for 2022. In applying the equity method, investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on the Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds (which include changes in the market value of the underlying securities in the funds).\nA summary of aggregated financial information for the Company’s investment funds and operating affiliates accounted for using the equity method is as follows: \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nInvested assets\n$\n113,977\n \n$\n91,534\n \nTotal assets\n132,647\n \n108,952\n \nTotal liabilities\n36,614\n \n33,901\n \nNet assets\n$\n96,033\n \n$\n75,051\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal revenues\n$\n19,160\n \n$\n7,766\n \n$\n12,305\n \nTotal expenses\n7,269\n \n7,174\n \n5,374\n \nNet income (loss)\n$\n11,891\n \n$\n592\n \n$\n6,931\n \nCertain of the Company’s other investments and investments accounted for using the equity method are in investment funds for which the Company has the option to redeem at \nagreed upon values as described in each investment fund’s subscription agreement. Depending on the terms of the various subscription agreements, investments in investment funds may be redeemed daily, monthly, quarterly or on other terms. Two common redemption restrictions which may impact the Company’s ability to redeem these investment funds are gates and lockups. A gate is a suspension of redemptions which may be implemented by the general partner or investment manager of the fund in order to defer, in whole or in part, the redemption request in the event the aggregate amount of redemption requests exceeds a predetermined percentage of the investment fund's net assets which may otherwise hinder the general partner or investment manager's ability to liquidate holdings in an orderly fashion in order to generate the cash necessary to fund extraordinarily large redemption payouts. A lockup period is the initial amount of time an investor is contractually required to hold the security before having the ability to redeem. If the investment funds are eligible to be redeemed, the time to redeem such fund can take weeks or months following the notification. \nInvestments in Operating Affiliates\nInvestments in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial policies are classified as ‘investments in operating affiliates’ on the Company’s balance sheets and are accounted for under the equity method. Such investments primarily include the Company’s investment in Coface SA (“Coface”), Greysbridge Holdings Ltd., (“Greysbridge”) and Premia Holdings Ltd. (“Premia”). Investments in Coface and Premia are generally recorded on a \nthree month\n lag, while the Company’s investment in Greysbridge is not recorded on a lag.\nIn 2021, the Company completed the share purchase agreement with Natixis to purchase \n29.5\n% of the common equity of Coface, a France-based leader in the global trade credit insurance market. The consideration paid was €\n9.95\n per share, or an aggregate €\n453\n million (approximately $\n546\n million) including related fees. Income (loss) from operating affiliates reflected a one-time gain of $\n75\n million realized from the acquisition. As a result of equity method accounting rules, approximately $\n36\n million of additional gain was deferred and will generally be recognized over the next \nfive years\n. As of December 31, 2024, the Company owned approximately \n29.9\n% of the issued shares of Coface, or \n30.03\n% excluding treasury shares, with a carrying value of $\n592\n million, compared to $\n570\n million at December 31, 2023.\nIn 2021, the Company completed acquisition of Somers Group Holdings Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Somers”) by Greysbridge for a cash purchase price of $\n35.00\n per common share. Somers is wholly owned by Greysbridge, and Greysbridge is owned \n40\n% by the Company, \n30\n% by certain investment funds managed by \nARCH CAPITAL\n142\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

It defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly fashion between market participants at the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for the disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The level in the hierarchy within which a given fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement (Level 1 being the highest priority and Level 3 being the lowest priority).\nThe levels in the hierarchy are defined as follows:\nLevel 1:\nInputs to the valuation methodology are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets\nLevel 2:\nInputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument\nLevel 3:\nInputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for securities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such securities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. The Company reviews its securities measured at fair value and discusses the proper classification of such investments with investment advisers and others.\nThe Company determines the existence of an active market based on its judgment as to whether transactions for the financial instrument occur in such market with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information. The independent pricing sources obtain market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets. The Company uses quoted values and other data provided by nationally recognized independent pricing sources as inputs into its process for determining fair values of its fixed maturity investments. To validate the techniques or models used by pricing sources, the Company's review process includes, but is not limited to: (i) quantitative analysis (\ne.g.\n, comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target \nbenchmark, with significant differences identified and investigated); (ii) a review of the prices obtained in the pricing process and the range of resulting fair values; (iii) initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value; (iv) a comparison of the fair value estimates to the Company’s knowledge of the current market; (v) a comparison of the pricing services' fair values to other pricing services' fair values for the same investments; and (vi) periodic back-testing, which includes randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing the executed prices to the fair value estimates from the pricing service. A price source hierarchy was maintained in order to determine which price source would be used (\ni.e.\n, a price obtained from a pricing service with more seniority in the hierarchy will be used over a less senior one in all cases). The hierarchy prioritizes pricing services based on availability and reliability and assigns the highest priority to index providers. Based on the above review, the Company will challenge any prices for a security or portfolio which are considered not to be representative of fair value. \nIn certain circumstances, when fair values are unavailable from these independent pricing sources, quotes are obtained directly from broker-dealers who are active in the corresponding markets. Such quotes are subject to the validation procedures noted above. Of the $\n35.0\n billion of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2024, approximately $\n185\n million, or \n0.5\n%, were priced using non-binding broker-dealer quotes. Of the $\n29.6\n billion of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2023, approximately $\n14\n million, or \n0.0\n%, were priced using non-binding broker-dealer quotes.\nFixed maturities\nThe Company uses the market approach valuation technique to estimate the fair value of its fixed maturity securities, when possible. The market approach includes obtaining prices from independent pricing services, such as index providers and pricing vendors, as well as to a lesser extent quotes from broker-dealers. The independent pricing sources obtain market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets. Each source has its own proprietary method for determining the fair value of securities that are not actively traded. In general, these methods involve the use of “matrix pricing” in which the independent pricing source uses observable market inputs including, but not limited to, investment yields, credit risks and spreads, benchmarking of like securities, broker-dealer quotes, reported trades and sector groupings to determine a reasonable fair value. The following describes the significant inputs generally used to determine the fair value of the Company’s fixed maturity securities by asset class:\nARCH CAPITAL\n144\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. government and government agencies\n – valuations provided by independent pricing services, with all prices provided through index providers and pricing vendors. The Company determined that all U.S. Treasuries would be classified as Level 1 securities due to observed levels of trading activity, the high number of strongly correlated pricing quotes received on U.S. Treasuries and other factors. The fair values of U.S. government agency securities are generally determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. As the yields for the risk-free yield curve and the spreads for these securities are observable market inputs, the fair values of U.S. government agency securities are classified within Level 2.\nCorporate bonds\n – valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through index providers and pricing vendors with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for corporate bonds are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. A small number of securities are included in Level 3 due to the lack of an available independent price source for such securities. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are unobservable, the fair value of such securities are classified as Level 3.\nResidential mortgage-backed securities\n – valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through pricing vendors and index providers with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined through the use of pricing models (including Option Adjusted Spread) which use spreads to determine the expected average life of the securities. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. The pricing services also review prepayment speeds and other indicators, when applicable. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for mortgage-backed securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2.\nMunicipal bonds\n – valuations provided by independent pricing services, with all prices provided through index providers and pricing vendors. The fair values of these securities are generally determined using spreads obtained from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market, trade prices and the new issue market. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for municipal bonds are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2.\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities\n – valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through index providers and pricing vendors with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined through the use of pricing models which use spreads to determine the appropriate average life of the securities. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for commercial mortgage-backed securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2.\nNon-U.S. government securities\n – valuations provided by independent pricing services, with all prices provided through index providers and pricing vendors. The fair values of these securities are generally based on international indices or valuation models which include daily observed yield curves, cross-currency basis index spreads and country credit spreads. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for non-U.S. government securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2.\nAsset-backed securities\n – valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through index providers and pricing vendors with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined through the use of pricing models (including Option Adjusted Spread) which use spreads to determine the appropriate average life of the securities. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for asset-backed securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. A small number of securities are included in Level 3 due to a low level of transparency on the inputs used in the pricing process.\nEquity securities\nThe Company determined that exchange-traded equity securities would be included in Level 1 as their fair values are based on quoted market prices in active markets. Other equity securities are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. A small number of securities are included in Level 3 due to the lack of an available independent price source for such securities. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are unobservable, the fair value of such securities are classified as Level 3.\n \nARCH CAPITAL\n145\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther investments\nThe Company determined that exchange-traded investments would be included in Level 1 as their fair values are based on quoted market prices in active markets. Other investments also include term loan investments for which fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of term loan investments with similar characteristics, pricing models or matrix pricing. Such investments are generally classified within Level 2. A small number of securities are included in Level 3 due to the lack of an available independent price source for such securities. \nDerivative instruments\nThe Company’s futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps and other derivatives trade in the over-the-counter derivative market. The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to estimate the fair value for these derivatives based on significant observable market inputs from third party pricing vendors, non-binding broker-dealer quotes and/or recent trading activity. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for these derivative instruments are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. \nShort-term investments\nThe Company determined that certain of its short-term investments held in highly liquid money market-type funds, Treasury bills and commercial paper would be included in Level 1 as their fair values are based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair values of certain short-term investments are generally determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve and are classified within Level 2. Other short-term investments are included in Level 3 due to the lack of an available independent price source for such securities. As the significant inputs used to price these short-term securities are unobservable, the fair value of such securities are classified as Level 3.\nResidential mortgage loans\nThe Company’s residential mortgage loans (included in ‘other assets’ in the consolidated balance sheets) include amounts related to the Company’s whole mortgage loan purchase and sell program. Fair values of residential mortgage loans are generally determined based on market prices. As significant inputs used in pricing process for these residential mortgage loans are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2.\nOther liabilities\nThe Company’s other liabilities include contingent and deferred consideration liabilities related to the Company’s acquisitions. Contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value recognized in ‘net realized gains (losses).’ To determine the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, the Company estimates the future payments using an income approach based on modeled inputs which include a weighted average cost of capital.

The carrying values of cash, accrued investment income, receivable for securities sold, certain other assets, payable for securities purchased and certain other liabilities approximated their fair values at December 31, 2024, due to their respective short maturities. As these financial instruments are not actively traded, their respective fair values are classified within Level 2.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company’s senior notes were carried at their cost, net of debt issuance costs, of $\n2.7\n billion and had a fair value of $\n2.4\n billion. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s senior notes were carried at their cost, net of debt issuance costs, of $\n2.7\n billion and had a fair value of $\n2.5\n billion. The fair values of the senior notes were obtained from a third party pricing service and are based on observable market inputs. As such, the fair value of the senior notes is classified within Level 2.\nARCH CAPITAL\n149\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally quarterly, annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. These assets include investments accounted for using the equity method, certain other investments, goodwill and intangible assets, and long-lived assets. The Company uses a variety of techniques to measure the fair value of these assets when appropriate, as described below: \nInvestments accounted for using the equity method.\n When the Company determines that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the Company records the assets at fair value with the loss recognized in income. In such cases, the Company measures the fair value of these assets using the techniques discussed above in “—Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis.”\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n. The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When the Company determines goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired, the Company uses techniques including discounted expected future cash flows, to measure fair value.\nLong-Lived Assets\n. The Company tests its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.\n \n11.    Derivative Instruments\nThe Company’s investment strategy allows for the use of derivative instruments. The Company’s derivative instruments are recorded on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Company utilizes exchange traded U.S. Treasury note, Eurodollar and other futures contracts and commodity futures to manage portfolio duration or replicate investment positions in its portfolios and the Company routinely utilizes foreign currency forward contracts, currency options, index futures contracts and other derivatives as part of its total return objective. In addition, certain of the Company’s investments are managed in portfolios which incorporate the use of foreign currency forward contracts which are intended to provide an economic hedge against foreign currency movements.\nThe following table summarizes information on the fair values and notional values of the Company’s derivative instruments: \nEstimated Fair Value\n \nAsset\nDerivatives (1)\nLiability Derivatives (1)\nNotional\nValue (2)\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n \n \nFutures contracts\n$\n78\n \n$\n(\n46\n)\n$\n4,781\n \nForeign currency forward contracts\n90\n \n(\n48\n)\n1,698\n \nOther (3)\n38\n \n(\n21\n)\n236\n \nTotal\n$\n206\n \n$\n(\n115\n)\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n \n \nFutures contracts\n$\n139\n \n$\n(\n61\n)\n$\n3,746\n \nForeign currency forward contracts\n27\n \n(\n32\n)\n1,224\n \nOther (3)\n31\n \n(\n26\n)\n512\n \nTotal\n$\n197\n \n$\n(\n119\n)\n(1)    \nThe fair value of asset derivatives are included in ‘\nother assets\n’ and the fair value of liability derivatives are included in ‘\nother liabilities\n.’\n(2)    \nRepresents the absolute notional value of all outstanding contracts, consisting of long and short positions.\n(3)    \nIncludes swaps, options and other derivatives contracts\n.\nThe Company did not hold any derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments at December 31, 2024 or 2023. \nThe Company’s derivative instruments can be traded under master netting agreements, which establish terms that apply to all derivative transactions with a counterparty. In the event of a bankruptcy or other stipulated event of default, such agreements provide that the non-defaulting party may elect to terminate all outstanding derivative transactions, in which case all individual derivative positions (loss or gain) with a counterparty are closed out and netted and replaced with a single amount, usually referred to as the termination amount, which is expressed in a single currency. The resulting single net amount, where positive, is payable to the party “in-the-money” regardless of whether or not it is the defaulting party, unless the parties have agreed that only the non-defaulting party is entitled to receive a termination payment where the net amount is positive and is in its favor. \nAt December 31, 2024, $\n206\n million and $\n115\n million, respectively, of asset derivatives and liability derivatives were subject to a master netting agreement compared to $\n197\n million and $\n119\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The remaining derivatives included in the table above were not subject to a master netting agreement.\nARCH CAPITAL\n150\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

At the time the Bellemeade Agreements were entered into, the applicability of the accounting guidance that addresses VIEs was evaluated. As a result of the evaluation of the Bellemeade Agreements, the Company concluded that these entities are VIEs. However, given that the ceding insurers do not have the unilateral power to direct those activities that are significant to their economic performance, the Company does not consolidate such entities in its consolidated financial statements. The reinsurance premium paid in regard to the Bellemeade Agreements is calculated by multiplying the outstanding \nreinsurance coverage amount at the beginning of the period by the coupon rate, which is the SOFR plus a contractual risk margin, less the actual investment income collected during the preceding month on the assets included in the underlying reinsurance trusts. In the event the assets included in the underlying reinsurance trusts became severely impaired or worthless and the special purpose reinsurance companies were unable to meet their future obligations, the Company’s mortgage insurance subsidiaries would be liable to fulfill claim payments to policyholders. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss associated with these VIEs is determined as the amount of mortgage insurance claim payments on the insured policies, net of aggregate reinsurance payments previously received, up to the full aggregate excess of loss reinsurance coverage amounts.\nThe following table summarizes the total assets of the Bellemeade entities:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nBellemeade Entities\n (Issue Date)\nTotal VIE Assets\nCoverage\nRemaining from\nReinsurers (1)\nTotal VIE Assets\n2019-1 Ltd.

Upon its formation in 2000, the Company received a written undertaking from the Minister of Finance in Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 assuring that, in the event that any legislation is enacted in Bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits, income, gain or appreciation on any capital asset, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, such tax will not be applicable to Arch Capital or any of its operations until March 31, 2035. However, on December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Bermuda CIT Act, which is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. Once in effect, the new corporate income tax regime in Bermuda is expected to supersede the Minister of Finance’s assurance, and the Company will become subject to taxes in Bermuda before March 31, 2035.\nThe Bermuda CIT Act will apply a 15% corporate income tax to certain Bermuda constituent entities of multi-national groups in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The Company expects to incur and pay increased taxes in Bermuda beginning in 2025. The Bermuda CIT Act, together with the widespread adoption of the OECD Pillar II minimum tax proposal, is expected to result in a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in most jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\nArch Capital has subsidiaries and branches that operate in various jurisdictions around the world that are subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The significant jurisdictions in which Arch Capital’s subsidiaries and branches are subject to tax are the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, and Gibraltar.\nARCH CAPITAL\n154\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s valuation allowance was $\n18\n million, compared to $\n15\n million at December 31, 2023. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to valuation allowances on the Company’s Australia, Gibraltar and Hong Kong operations and certain other deferred income tax assets relating to tax attributes that have a limited use.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits were as follows: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\nExpiration\nOperating Loss Carryforwards\nUnited Kingdom\n$\n146\n \nNo expiration\nIreland\n26\n \nNo expiration\nAustralia\n43\n \nNo expiration\nHong Kong\n35\n \nNo expiration\nGibraltar\n26\n \nNo expiration\nCyprus\n1\n \nNo expiration\nUnited States (1)\n70\n \n2029 - 2038\nTax Credits\nU.K. foreign tax credits\n14\n \nNo expiration\nU.S. foreign tax credits\n8\n \n2029 - 2033\n(1) The Company’s U.S. operations have recorded $\n70\n million of net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards that are subject to annual usage limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“the Code”).\n \nThe Company’s U.S. mortgage operations are eligible for a tax deduction, subject to certain limitations, under Section 832(e) of the Code for amounts required by state law or regulation to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves. The deduction is allowed only to the extent that the Company purchases non-interest bearing U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds (“T&L Bonds”) issued by the U.S. Treasury Department in an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from deducting any portion of the statutory contingency reserves. T&L Bonds are reflected in ‘other assets’ on the Company’s balance sheet and totaled approximately $\n47\n million at December 31, 2024, compared to $\n42\n million at December 31, 2023.\nDeferred income tax liabilities have not been accrued with respect to the undistributed earnings of the Company's U.S., U.K. and Ireland subsidiaries as it is the Company’s intention that all such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. If the earnings were to be distributed, as dividends or otherwise, such amounts may be subject to withholding tax in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. The Company does not intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings from the Company's Canada subsidiary, however, no income or withholding taxes have been accrued as the Canada subsidiary does not have positive cumulative earnings and profits and therefore a distribution from this particular subsidiary would not be subject to income taxes or withholding taxes. Potential tax implications of repatriation from the Company’s unremitted earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are driven by facts at the time of distribution. Therefore, it is not practicable to estimate the income tax liabilities that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted. Distributions from the U.K. or Ireland would not be subject to withholding tax and no deferred income tax liability would need to be accrued. \nARCH CAPITAL\n156\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

Premia is the parent of Premia Reinsurance Ltd., a multi-line Bermuda reinsurance company. Premia’s strategy is to reinsure or acquire companies or reserve portfolios in the non-life property and casualty insurance and reinsurance run-off market. Arch Re Bermuda and certain Arch co-investors invested $\n100\n million and acquired approximately \n25\n% of Premia as well as warrants to purchase additional common equity. Arch has appointed \ntwo\n directors to serve on the \nseven\n person board of directors of Premia. Arch Re Bermuda is providing a quota share reinsurance treaty on certain business written by Premia, and subsidiaries of Arch Capital are providing certain administrative and support services to Premia, in each case pursuant to separate multi-year agreements. During the 2024 period, the Company did not enter into any new reinsurance transactions with Premia, compared to $\n80\n million and $\n81\n million of net premiums \nwritten and earned, respectively in 2023. At December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a funds held asset from Premia of $\n137\n million, compared to $\n158\n million at December 31, 2023.\nIn 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Somers. Somers is wholly owned by Greysbridge, and Greysbridge is owned \n40\n% by the Company and by certain funds managed by Kelso and Warburg. The Company entered into certain reinsurance transactions with Somers. During 2024 and 2023 periods, the Company’s net premiums written was reduced by $\n738\n million and $\n574\n million, respectively. In addition, Somers paid certain acquisition costs and administrative fees to the Company. At December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a reinsurance recoverable on unpaid and paid losses from Somers of $\n1.6\n billion and a reinsurance balance payable to Somers of $\n489\n million. At December 31, 2023, reinsurance recoverable on unpaid and paid losses from Somers was $\n1.3\n billion, with a reinsurance balance payable to Somers of $\n475\n million. \nUnder the terms of the Greysbridge equity financing, beginning January 1, 2024, the Company has a call right (but not the obligation) and Warburg and Kelso each have a put right (but not the obligation) to buy/sell a certain amount of their initial shares annually at the current year-end tangible book value per share of Greysbridge. In 2024, Warburg and Kelso both delivered a put option notice to sell a certain amount of their initial shares. The transaction, which will involve third-party purchasers of such shares, is expected to close in the 2025 calendar year, subject to any required regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. In association with the put option notice at December 31, 2024, the Company’s balance sheet reflected $\n261\n million in both other assets and other liabilities.\nDuring 2024 period, the Company completed the acquisition of Watford Insurance Company from Somers for a total consideration paid of $\n35\n million.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company owns $\n35\n million in aggregate principal amount of Somers \n6.5\n% senior notes, due July 2, 2029\n.\nARCH CAPITAL\n157\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17.    Leases\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company renews and enters into new leases for office property and equipment. At the lease inception date, the Company determines whether a contract contains a lease and its classification as a finance or operating lease. Primarily all of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases. The Company’s operating leases have remaining lease terms of up to \n13\n years, some of which include options to extend the lease term. The Company considers these options when determining the lease term and measuring its lease liability and right-of-use asset. In addition, the Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nShort-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less were excluded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and represent an inconsequential amount of operating lease expense. \nAs most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. \nAdditional information regarding the Company’s operating leases is as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nOperating lease costs\n$\n34\n \n$\n33\n \nSublease income (1)\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n(\n2\n)\nCash payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities reported in operating cash flows\n$\n30\n \n$\n31\n \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities\n$\n30\n \n$\n28\n \nRight-of-use assets (2)\n$\n129\n \n$\n125\n \nOperating lease liability (2)\n$\n163\n \n$\n156\n \nWeighted average discount rate\n4.9\n \n%\n4.7\n \n%\nWeighted average remaining lease term\n7.2\n years\n7.2\n years\n(1)    \nThe sublease income primarily relates to office property in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n(2)    \nThe right-of-use assets are included in ‘\nother assets\n’ while the operating lease liability is included in ‘\nother liabilities\n.’\nThe following table presents the contractual maturities of the Company's operating lease liabilities at December 31, 2024:\nYears Ending December 31,\n2025\n$\n31\n \n2026\n31\n \n2027\n28\n \n2028\n24\n \n2029\n19\n \n2030 and thereafter\n63\n \nTotal undiscounted lease liability\n$\n196\n \nLess: present value adjustment\n(\n33\n)\nOperating lease liability\n$\n163\n \nRental expense was approximately $\n35\n million, $\n38\n million and $\n39\n million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n18.    Commitments and Contingencies\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe creditworthiness of a counterparty is evaluated by the Company, taking into account credit ratings assigned by independent agencies. The credit approval process involves an assessment of factors, including, among others, the counterparty, country and industry credit exposure limits. Collateral may be required, at the discretion of the Company, on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty.\nThe areas where significant concentrations of credit risk may exist include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable, contractholder receivables, ceded unearned premiums, paid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable net of reinsurance balances payable, investments and cash and cash equivalent balances. A credit exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverables as they may become uncollectible. The Company manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and, if necessary, the Company may hold collateral in the form of funds, trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. In addition, certain insurance policies written by the Company’s insurance operations feature large deductibles, primarily in its construction and national accounts lines of business. Under such contracts, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant for the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. These amounts are included on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet in contractholder payables and contractholder receivables, respectively. In the event that the Company is unable to collect from the policyholder, the Company would be liable for such \nARCH CAPITAL\n158\n2024  FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

The total common shares that may be purchased under the ESPP was increased by \n3.0\n million shares for a total of \n12.75\n million shares authorized. The purpose of the ESPP is to give employees of the Company an opportunity to purchase common shares through payroll deductions, thereby encouraging employees to share in the economic growth and success of the Company. The ESPP is designed to qualify as an “employee share purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. At December 31, 2024, \n3.2\n million shares remain available for issuance. \nStock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights\nThe Company generally issues stock options and SARs to eligible employees, with exercise prices equal to the fair market values of the Company’s Common Shares on the grant dates (adjusted for special dividends). Such grants generally vest over a \nthree year\n period with one-third vesting on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date. In connection with the Company’s recent leadership transition in November 2024, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee approved the grant of equity awards, which consist of \n1.75\n million premium-priced stock options to eligible employees.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThere were no state-prescribed or permitted regulatory accounting practices for any of the Company’s insurance or reinsurance entities that resulted in reported statutory surplus that differed from that which would have been reported under the prescribed practices of the respective regulatory authorities, including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The differences between statutory financial statements and statements prepared in accordance with GAAP vary by jurisdiction, however, with the primary differences being that statutory financial statements may not reflect deferred acquisition costs, certain net deferred income tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets, unrealized appreciation or depreciation on debt securities and certain unauthorized reinsurance recoverables and include contingency reserves.\nThe statutory net income (loss) for the Company’s principal operating subsidiaries for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStatutory net income (loss):\nBermuda\n$\n4,750\n \n$\n3,519\n \n$\n1,730\n \nIreland\n62\n \n53\n \n(\n53\n)\nUnited States\n918\n \n592\n \n220\n \nUnited Kingdom\n41\n \n72\n \n57\n \nCanada\n6\n \n6\n \n9\n \nAustralia\n54\n \n68\n \n39\n \nBermuda\nThe Company’s Bermuda insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 and related regulations, each as amended (the “Insurance Act”). Arch Re Bermuda, the Company’s principal reinsurance and insurance subsidiary, is dual licensed as a Class 4 general business insurer and a Class C long-term insurer while Arch Group Reinsurance Ltd. (“AGRL”) is registered as a Class 3A general insurer and provides affiliated quota share reinsurance covering certain U.S. business. The Insurance Act requires that both entities maintain minimum statutory capital and surplus equal to the greater of a minimum solvency margin and the enhanced capital requirement (“ECR”) as determined by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”). The ECR is calculated based on the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement model, a risk-based model that takes into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the company’s business. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the actual and required capital and surplus were based on the economic balance sheet requirements.\nUnder the Insurance Act, Arch Re Bermuda and AGRL are restricted with respect to the payment of dividends. Each entity is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial \nyear dividends of more than \n25\n% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year’s statutory balance sheet) unless it files, at least \nseven days\n before payment of such dividends, with the BMA an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins following the declaration of those dividends. Accordingly, Arch Re Bermuda can pay approximately $\n5.5\n billion to Arch Capital during 2025 without providing an affidavit to the BMA. Dividends or distributions, if any, made by AGRL would result in an increase in available capital at Arch-U.S.\nIreland\nThe Company has \nthree\n Irish subsidiaries: Arch Re Europe, an authorized life and non-life reinsurer, Arch Insurance (EU), an authorized non-life insurer and Arch Underwriting Europe, a registered insurance and reinsurance intermediary. Irish authorized reinsurers and insurers, such as Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Irish intermediaries, and Arch Underwriters Europe, are subject to the general body of Irish laws and regulations including the provisions of the Companies Act 2014. As part of the Company’s Brexit plan, Arch Insurance (EU) received approval from the Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”) to expand the nature of its business in 2019 and commenced writing insurance lines in the European Economic Area in 2020, and the Part VII Transfer was completed at the end of December 2020. Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Underwriters Europe are subject to the supervision of the CBI and must comply with Irish insurance acts and regulations as well as with directions and guidance issued by the CBI. Arch Re Europe and Arch Insurance (EU) are required to maintain a minimum level of capital. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, these requirements were met.\nThe amount of dividends these subsidiaries are permitted to declare is limited to accumulated, realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. The solvency and capital requirements must still be met following any distribution. Dividends or distributions, if any, made by Arch Re Europe would result in an increase in available capital at Arch Re Bermuda.\nUnited States\nThe Company’s U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The ability of the Company’s regulated insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards. These regulations include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends or other distributions, such as loans or cash advances, available to \nARCH CAPITAL\n167\n2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nshareholders without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities.\nDividends or distributions, if any, made by Arch Re U.S. would result in an increase in available capital at Arch-U.S., the Company’s U.S. holding company. Arch Re U.S. can declare a maximum of approximately $\n339\n million of dividends during 2025 subject to the approval of the Commissioner of the Delaware Department of Insurance. \nAMIC and UGRIC are approved as eligible mortgage insurers by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, subject to their comprehensive requirements, known as the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements or “PMIERs.” The GSEs amend the PMIERs from time to time at their discretion and most recently issued PMIERs Guidance 2024-01 on August 21, 2024 (effective March 31, 2025 with a corresponding transition schedule through September 30, 2026), to incorporate new deductions to the definition of “available assets” for investment risk. Further, the amount of assets required to satisfy the revised financial requirements of the PMIERs may be affected by many factors, including macro-economic conditions, the size and composition of our mortgage insurance portfolio, and the amount of risk ceded to reinsurers that may be deducted in our calculation of “minimum required assets.” \nThe Company’s U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by their respective domiciliary and primary regulators, which include the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (“Wisconsin OCI”) and the North Carolina Department of Insurance (“NC DOI”), as well as the state insurance departments in each state in which they are licensed. As mandated by state insurance laws, mortgage insurers are generally mono-line companies. Each company is subject to the statutory requirements of their domiciliary regulator as to payment of dividends and return of capital; the GSEs may also impart\n \nlimitations on dividends with respect to the Company’s eligible mortgage insurers, such as if available assets fall below the required minimum assets. Under respective state law, the Company’s U.S. mortgage subsidiaries can declare a maximum of approximately $\n237\n million of ordinary dividends in 2025, however, dividend capacity is limited by the respective companies unassigned surplus amounts. Such dividends would increase the available capital at Arch U.S. MI Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of Arch-U.S. \nMortgage insurance companies licensed in Wisconsin or North Carolina are required to establish contingency loss reserves for purposes of statutory accounting in an amount equal to at least \n50\n% of net earned premiums. These amounts generally cannot be withdrawn for a period of \n10\n years and are separate liabilities for statutory accounting purposes, which affects the ability to pay dividends. However, with prior regulatory approval, a mortgage insurance company \nmay make early withdrawals from the contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed \n35\n% of net premiums earned in a calendar year.\nUnder Wisconsin and North Carolina law, as well as that of 14 other states, a mortgage insurer must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its risk in force in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. While formulations of minimum capital vary in certain jurisdictions, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of \n25\n to 1. Wisconsin and North Carolina require mortgage insurers to maintain a “minimum policyholder position” calculated in accordance with their respective regulations. Policyholders' position consists primarily of statutory policyholders' surplus plus the contingency loss reserves.\nUnited Kingdom\nThe Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) regulate insurance and reinsurance companies and the FCA regulates firms carrying on insurance mediation activities operating in the U.K., both under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. In May 2004, Arch Insurance (U.K.) was granted the relevant permissions for the classes of insurance business which it underwrites in the U.K. AMAL currently manages our Lloyd’s Syndicates pursuant to its authorizations by the U.K. regulators and Lloyd’s. All U.K. companies are also subject to a range of statutory provisions, including the laws and regulations of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended) (the “U.K. Companies Act”).\nArch Insurance (U.K.) and AMAL must maintain a margin of solvency at all times under the Solvency II Directive from the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. The regulations stipulate that insurers are required to maintain the minimum capital requirement and solvency capital requirement at all times. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, these requirements were met.\nAs corporate members of Lloyd’s, AMAL (as managing agent of the Company’s Lloyd’s Syndicates) and each syndicate’s respective corporate members are subject to the oversight of the Council of Lloyd’s. The capital required to support a Syndicate’s underwriting capacity, or funds at Lloyd’s, is assessed annually and is determined by Lloyd’s in accordance with the capital adequacy rules established by the PRA. The Company has provided capital to support the underwriting of our Lloyd’s Syndicates in the form of pledged assets and letters of credit provided by Arch Re Bermuda. The amount which the Company provides as funds at Lloyd’s is not available for distribution to the Company for the payment of dividends. Lloyd’s is supervised by the PRA and required to implement certain rules prescribed by the PRA under the Lloyd’s Act of 1982 regarding the operation \nARCH CAPITAL\n168\n2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nof the Lloyd’s market. With respect to managing agents and corporate members, Lloyd’s prescribes certain minimum standards relating to management and control, solvency and other requirements and monitors managing agents’ compliance with such standards.\nUnder U.K. law, all U.K. companies are restricted from declaring a dividend to their shareholders unless they have “profits available for distribution.” The calculation as to whether a company has sufficient profits is based on its accumulated realized profits minus its accumulated realized losses. U.K. insurance regulatory laws do not prohibit the payment of dividends, but the PRA or FCA, as applicable, requires that insurance companies and insurance intermediaries maintain certain solvency margins and may restrict the payment of a dividend by Arch Insurance (U.K.) and AMAL.\nCanada\nArch Insurance Canada and the Canadian branch of Arch Re U.S. (“Arch Re Canada”) are subject to federal, as well as provincial and territorial, regulation in Canada. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (“OSFI”) is the federal regulatory body that, under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), regulates federal Canadian and non-Canadian insurance companies operating in Canada. Arch Insurance Canada and Arch Re Canada are subject to regulation in the provinces and territories in which they underwrite insurance/reinsurance, and the primary goal of insurance/reinsurance regulation at the provincial and territorial levels is to govern the market conduct of insurance/reinsurance companies. Arch Insurance Canada is licensed to carry on insurance business by OSFI and in each province and territory. Arch Re Canada is licensed to carry-on reinsurance business by OSFI and in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. \nUnder the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), Arch Insurance Canada is required to maintain an adequate amount of capital in Canada, calculated in accordance with a test promulgated by OSFI called the Minimum Capital Test (“MCT”), and Arch Re Canada is required to maintain an adequate margin of assets over liabilities in Canada, calculated in accordance with a test promulgated by OSFI called the Branch Adequacy of Assets Test. Under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), approval of the Minister of Finance (Canada) is required in connection with certain acquisitions of shares of, or control of, Canadian insurance companies such as Arch Insurance Canada, and notice to and/or approval of OSFI is required in connection with the payment of dividends by or redemption of shares by Canadian insurance companies such as Arch Insurance Canada.\nAustralia\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (“APRA”) is an independent statutory authority responsible for prudential supervision of institutions across banking, insurance and superannuation and promotes financial stability in Australia. Arch Indemnity has been authorized to conduct monoline lenders’ mortgage insurance business in Australia since June 2002 and was acquired by Arch Capital on August 30, 2021 and since that date is the primary provider of lenders’ mortgage insurance for the group. Arch Indemnity has also been licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) since March 2011 to engage in credit activities in Australia. Arch LMI Pty Ltd. (“Arch LMI”) was formerly authorized by APRA in January 2019 to conduct monoline lenders’ mortgage insurance business in Australia; however, in December 2022, we converted Arch LMI to a services company for our Australian lenders mortgage insurance operations and the company relinquished its APRA authorization. Major regulatory requirements that are applicable to Arch Indemnity in general as an insurance provider and financial institution in Australia include requirements and compliance with minimum capital levels; risk management strategy; corporate governance standards, privacy legislation on the collection, use and storage of personal information; cyber security obligations imposed by APRA and ASIC; modern slavery legislation; anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism legislation. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, these requirements were met.\nArch Capital also conducts property and casualty insurance business in Australia through the Company’s Lloyd’s platform. This insurance business is managed by and distributed through local coverholders and is subject to Lloyd’s Supervision. In addition, the business is subject to local Australian prudential regulatory oversight by APRA, and additional separate financial services market conduct regulation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\nARCH CAPITAL\n169\n2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

The Company currently estimates that the losses will be in a range of $\n450\n million to $\n550\n million, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums. This pre-tax preliminary loss estimate is based on industry insured losses ranging from $\n35\n billion to $\n45\n billion. The Company’s preliminary estimate is based on currently available information derived from modeling techniques, industry assessments of exposure, preliminary claims information obtained from the Company’s clients and brokers to date and a review of in-force contracts. The Company’s actual losses from this event may vary materially from the estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations.\nShare Repurchases\nFrom January 1 to February 27, 2025, the Company repurchased approximately \n2.0\n million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $\n180\n million.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIn connection with the filing of this Form 10-K, our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of December 31, 2024, for the purposes set forth in the applicable rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in \nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nOn August 1, 2024, we completed the MCE Acquisition, and we are currently integrating the MCE Acquisition into our internal control system. Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC, we exclude the MCE Acquisition from our evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures described above and our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The MCE Acquisition represents 1.6% of total assets, and 3.5% of total revenues as of December 31, 2024.\nBased on our assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in Item 8.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the item noted above, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nARCH CAPITAL\n171\n2024 FORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.
