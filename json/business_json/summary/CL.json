  "item1_summary": " The substantial growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers . “Private label” products sold by our retail customers, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our products .\n The growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products . Our ability to launch new products, to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully: identify, develop and fund technological innovations; obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others .\n Our ability to quickly innovate to adapt and market our products is an essential part of our business strategy . Failure to develop and launch successful new products or to adapt our packaging, the sustainability profile of our products or supply chain to meet such preferences could hinder the growth of the business . Any delay in the development of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position .\n Maintaining a strong reputation with consumers and trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products . Even if we are not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products . Negative publicity about us, our brands, our products, our supply chain, our ingredients and our employees could jeopardize our reputation .\n Negative publicity, posts or comments on digital and social media, whether true or untrue, could damage our brands and reputation . Success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers . The legal, regulatory and ethics landscape around the use of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving .\n Third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks . A pandemic, epidemic or other widespread health concern could have a variety of impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition .

Our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees . Successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and succession plans for senior management, is critical to our business success .\n The company says it is working to improve the quality of its workforce . It says it may be difficult to meet the needs of the workforce in order to meet them . The company is working with the public to improve its quality of service to ensure that the workforce is on the right track to meet their needs . The firm says it will continue to work with other companies in the future to improve quality of services .\n Acquisitions have resulted in and could in the future result in substantial additional debt, the assumption of liabilities, such as litigation or earn-out obligations, or transaction costs . Any of these risks could adversely impact our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition . If any planned divestiture is not able to be completed, we may also incur negative business and financial results .\n Our operations and those of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or logistics providers have been and may continue to be disrupted by a number of factors, including political, economic and environmental factors . These include: geopolitical events, wars and military conflicts, pandemics, health emergencies, labor disputes and other labor disputes . We purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers .\n We believe supplies of raw and packaging materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate . We have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers . Volatility in material and other costs has in the past and may continue to adversely impact our profitability . Increases in the costs of and/or a reduction in the availability of commodities, energy (including fuel prices), logistics (including trucks and containers) or other necessary services .\n While prices of many commodities and services have retreated from their historical peaks, prices may increase again . There is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce ct. ct in the Middle East, and/or the impact of climatic events have affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our profit margins . Even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain the price increases .\n One way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization . These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials . If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected .\n Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming  evolving in nature . Cyberattacks are becoming more frequent, cyberattacks are more frequent and more frequent . Cybersecurity systems are subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other  cyberattacks .\n Cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware . Techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time . A cyberattack or cyber incident may adversely impact our ability to ship products to customers, issue invoices and process payments .\n The rapid evolution and increased adoption of existing and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, may intensify our cybersecurity risks . As the frequency and magnitude of cybersecurity incidents increase globally, we may be unable to obtain insurance coverage that we think is appropriate or necessary to offset the risk . While we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our IT/OT Systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason,  we may suffer interruptions in our  operations .\n Climate change and other sustainability matters could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations . The predicted physical effects of climate change may exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water and the cost, quality and availability of raw and packaging materials .

We use third parties including, but not limited to, suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, commercial banks and other external business partners . Disruption in these relationships could have an adverse effect on our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition .\n A decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation . An inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients, to obtain regulatory approval of such products or ingredients on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business .\n While our policies mandate compliance with these laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents . Violations of these laws could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition .\n There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters . Disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment .\n Unfavorable global economic conditions have negatively impacted and/or could negatively impact our business .

Our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced offerings .\n Disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business . We could face difficulty collecting or recovering accounts receivables from third parties facing financial or operational difficulties, including bankruptcies . In addition, tighter or more volatile credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers .\n Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change . Changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates could adversely impact our future effective tax rate and business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition .\n Many jurisdictions outside of the European Union have also implemented a similar minimum tax regime consistent with the policy of Pillar II . Other than significant additional time and resources to comply, based on our preliminary evaluation, Pillar II did not have a material impact as of December 31, 2024 . However, as these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be impacted .\n Enterprise Risk Management Committee monitors both current and emerging risks facing the Company .
