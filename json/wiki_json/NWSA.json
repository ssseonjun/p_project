  "raw_text": "The second and current incarnation of News Corporation, doing business as News Corp, is an American mass media and publishing company headquartered at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The company was formed on June 28, 2013, as a spin-off of the first News Corporation, whose legal successor was 21st Century Fox, which held its media and entertainment assets. Operating across digital real estate information, news media, book publishing, and cable television, News Corp's notable assets include: Dow Jones & Company, which is the publisher of The Wall Street Journal; News UK, publisher of The Sun and The Times; News Corp Australia; REA Group, operator of realestate.com.au and realtor.com; and book publisher HarperCollins.\nNews Corp and 21st Century Fox are two companies that succeeded the original News Corp., which included Fox Entertainment Group and other broadcasting and media properties. The spin-out was structured so that 21st Century Fox was the legal continuation of the original News Corporation, with the new News Corp being a new company formed by a stock split. Since March 2019, Fox Corporation, which holds 21st Century Fox's national broadcasting, news and sports assets, is also under the Murdoch family's control. In September 2023, Rupert Murdoch announced he would step down as News Corp's chairman by November.\n\nHistory\nFormation\nOn June 28, 2012, Rupert Murdoch announced that News Corporation's publishing operations would be spun off to form a new, publicly traded company. Murdoch stated that performing this split would \"unlock the true value of both companies and their distinct assets, enabling investors to benefit from the separate strategic opportunities resulting from more focused management of each division\". The move also came in the wake of a series of scandals that had damaged the reputation of multiple News Corporation-owned properties.\nRobert Thomson, then editor of The Wall Street Journal, was announced as the initial chief operating officer for the company. While Murdoch did not serve as CEO, he remained chairman and a shareholder of the new News Corp. Thomson promised that the new company would \"cultivate a start-up sensibility even though we already work for the world's most established and prestigious diversified media and information services company\" and would emphasize building new business models around its properties and content. The logo of the new News Corporation was unveiled at an investor presentation on May 28, 2013; the handwritten logo uses script based on Murdoch's own handwriting.\nNews Corp's board approved the split on May 24, 2013, while shareholders approved the split on June 11;\nPreliminary trading on the Australian Securities Exchange of the new News Corp's class B stock began on June 19, 2013, at around $15 per share; a value slightly lower than expected by some analysts. The shares fell in price by 3% to $14.55 per share, valuing the new company at around $7.9 billion US. The corporate split was finalized on June 28, 2013; during the stock splitting process, one share of the new News Corp was given to shareholders for every four shares they owned in the former News Corp.\nThe current News Corp began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol \"NWS\" on July 1, 2013; at the same time, the former News Corporation (which encompassed purely of media properties, such as Fox Entertainment Group and 20th Century Fox) was renamed 21st Century Fox.\n\nAfter the split\nOn September 4, 2013, News Corp announced that it would sell the Dow Jones Local Media Group, a group of 33 local newspapers, to Newcastle Investment Corp., an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group, for $87 million. The newspapers will be operated by GateHouse Media, a newspaper group owned by Fortress. Robert Thomson indicated that the newspapers \"were not strategically consistent with the emerging portfolio\" of the company. GateHouse then filed for prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 27, 2013, to restructure its debt obligations to accommodate the acquisition. Then GateHouse emerged from bankruptcy on November 26, 2013.\nOn December 20, 2013, News Corp announced its acquisition of Dublin, Ireland-based social news agency Storyful, a startup founded by journalist Mark Little. At the time, Storyful was described as \"scour[ing] social-media services like Twitter and Instagram\" to discover user-generated content \"breaking news and viral online content\" and after sourcing, to then verify, acquire, and distribute it. Storyful had, for instance, reported 2013 results of 750m views of user-generated videos by its partners. The cost of the Storyful acquisition was €18 million (£15m, US$25m), and marked News Corp's first acquisition since the split. News Corp CEO at the time, Robert Thomson, stated that the service had \"become the village square for valuable video, using journalistic sensibility, integrity and creativity\", and that with the acquisition, News Corp would \"define the opportunities that the digital landscape presents, rather than simply adapt to them\".\nOn May 2, 2014, News Corp acquired romance novel publisher Harlequin Enterprises from Torstar for $415 million. The deal closed on August 1; it is now operated as a subsidiary of News Corp's HarperCollins.\nOn September 30, 2014, News Corp announced its acquisition of Move, Inc., a real estate listings company and owner of Realtor.com, a 20% stake of which was, at the time, owned by REA Group, a publicly traded subsidiary of News Corp Australia.\nNews Corp also began making investments in India in late 2014, such as a $30 million investment in real estate site ProTiger in November, the December 2014 purchase of BigDecisions.com, a financial planning website, and the acquisition of Indian media firm VCCircle in March 2015.\nIn October 2015, News Corp sold its digital education brand Amplify to a management team supported by a group of private investors for an undisclosed sum. In June 2016, News Corp acquired Wireless Group (formerly UTV Media), a British radio broadcaster, for $296 million\nIn January 2020, News Corp sold Unruly, an outstream video ad marketplace, in exchange of 6.91% of Tremor Video stock. On July 31, 2020, James Murdoch resigned from the News Corp board of directors, \"due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.\"\nOn February 4, 2022, News Corp suffered a cyberattack from hackers believed to be linked to China.\nOn October 14, 2022, it was announced that, under the instruction of Rupert Murdoch, a special committee had been established to explore a potential merger of Fox and News Corp, bringing the two companies back together since the former 21st Century Fox was spun-off from News Corp in 2013. On January 24, 2023, the proposed merger was abandoned by Murdoch.\nIn February 2023, the company announced that it would be cutting 5% of its workforce across its various divisions.\nIn September 2023, News Corp reported that Rupert Murdoch would retire from the board of News Corporation. He would also retire from the board of Fox Corporation and his son Lachlan Murdoch would replace him on both boards. The retirement would take effect in November 2023.\nAn annual meeting of shareholders was held by webcast on 20 November 2024, to determine whether the \"dual-class\" share structure (voting and non-voting) would be abolished, after Starboard Value, which has bought up a large share of News Corp over the previous year, had proposed a one-share-one-vote system. News Corp had stated that if the proposal is accepted, the new system of shares could only be introduced if agreement between voting and non-voting shareholders was reached. This relates to the ongoing court case in Nevada pitting Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch against the other three siblings, who all have voting shares. The proposal was not accepted at the meeting.\nIn June 2025, the company announced it had extended the contract of its chief executive Robert Thomson to June 2030.\n\nSuccession\nIn September 2024, Rupert Murdoch applied to a Nevada probate court to remove voting rights from his children other than Lachlan, as set out in the irrevocable family trust. The other siblings, Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch, are more moderate politically than their father or brother, and Rupert was keen to keep the conservative political leanings in his media outlets. On December 9, 2024, The New York Times reported that the court had ruled against Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, who, the probate commissioner wrote, had acted in bad faith when trying to change the trust.\n\nAssets\nThe company consists of the former News Corporation's newspaper and book publishing assets, together with the digital real-estate advertising properties that are now its largest business.\n\nSee also\nSuccession of Rupert Murdoch, a 2024 court case\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nBusiness data for News Corp Class A US shares: \nBusiness data for News Corp Class B US shares: \nBusiness data for News Corp Class A AU shares: \nBusiness data for News Corp Class B AU shares:",
