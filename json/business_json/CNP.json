Business for more details.\nNatural Gas Combustion Turbines. \nIn 2022, Indiana Electric received approval from the IURC for a CPCN seeking approval to construct two natural gas combustion turbines to replace portions of its existing coal-fired generation fleet. The turbines are targeted to be operational by mid-year 2025.  For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nSolar. \nIndiana Electric entered into an amended and restated BTA to build a 191 MW solar array in Posey County, Indiana, , and a BTA to acquire a 130 MW solar array in Pike County, Indiana through a special purpose entity for a capped purchase price; however on March 15, 2024, Indiana Electric provided notice to the IURC that it was exercising its right to terminate this BTA. For further information about Indiana Electric’s BTA’s, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nTemporary Generation. \nAs allowed by a law enacted by the Texas legislature after the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and amended in 2023, Houston Electric is leasing TEEEF that can aid in restoring power to customers during certain significant power outages that are impacting its distribution system. On December 19, 2024, Houston Electric announced a proposal to release certain of Houston Electric’s TEEEF to the San Antonio area prior to the summer of 2025 for a period of up to two years, during which Houston Electric would not receive revenue or profit from ERCOT and would not charge Houston-area customers for these TEEEF units. As of December 31, 2024, Houston Electric leased 505 MW of TEEEF. For more information, see Note 7 and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. \nSubstations.\n  A substation is a facility that transforms electricity from a higher voltage to a lower voltage or vice versa. Generally, this facility is the interface between the transmission system and the distribution grid. The following table presents certain information related to CenterPoint Energy’s substations as of December 31, 2024:\n \n \nNumber of Substations\nTransformer Capacity (in Mva)\nHouston Electric\n243 \n73,667 \nIndiana Electric\n109 \n6,992 \nTotal CenterPoint Energy\n352 \n80,659 \n46\nService Centers.\n  Service centers consist of office buildings, warehouses and repair facilities that are used in the business of transmitting and distributing electricity.

CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas Indiana and Ohio mains are located in Indiana and Ohio except for, in the case of CenterPoint Energy, pipeline facilities extending from points in northern Kentucky to points in southern Indiana so that gas may be transported to Indiana and sold or transported to customers in Indiana. Generally, in each of the cities, towns and rural areas served by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas, they own the underground gas mains and service lines, metering and regulating equipment located on customers’ premises and the district regulating equipment necessary for pressure \n47\nmaintenance. With a few exceptions, the measuring stations at which CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas receive gas are owned, operated and maintained by others, and their distribution facilities begin at the outlet of the measuring equipment. These facilities, including odorizing equipment, are usually located on land owned by suppliers.\nAs of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, through CEIP, owned and operated over 219 miles of intrastate pipeline in Louisiana and Texas. On February 19, 2024, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses, which include the intrastate pipelines owned by CEIP in Louisiana. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nItem 3.\nLegal Proceedings\nFor a discussion of material legal and regulatory proceedings, including environmental legal proceedings that involve a governmental authority as a party and that the Registrants reasonably believe would result in $1,000,000 or more of monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, under federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, affecting the Registrants, read “Business — Regulation” and “Business — Environmental Matters” in Item 1 of this report, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report and Note 14(d) to the consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 4.\nMine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nThis combined Form 10-K is filed separately by three registrants: CenterPoint Energy, Inc., CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp.\nItem 5.\nMarket for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nCenterPoint Energy\nAs of February 10, 2025, CenterPoint Energy’s common stock was held by approximately 21,495 shareholders of record.

For further information on CenterPoint Energy’s dividends, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRepurchases of Equity Securities\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, none of CenterPoint Energy’s equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, were purchased by or on behalf of CenterPoint Energy or any “affiliated purchasers,” as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nHouston Electric\nAs of February 10, 2025, all of Houston Electric’s 1,000 outstanding common shares were held by Utility Holding, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy.\nCERC\nAs of February 10, 2025, all of CERC Corp.’s 1,000 outstanding shares of common stock were held by Utility Holding, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy.\n48\nItem 6.        \n[Reserved] \nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following combined discussion and analysis should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. The discussion of CenterPoint Energy’s consolidated financial information includes the results of CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp., which, along with CenterPoint Energy, Inc., are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such. Unless the context indicates otherwise, specific references to Houston Electric and CERC also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Houston Electric and CERC, unless stated otherwise. No registrant makes any representations as to the information related solely to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. or the subsidiaries of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. other than itself. \nOVERVIEW\nBackground\nCenterPoint Energy is a public utility holding company. CenterPoint Energy’s operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission, distribution and generation facilities and natural gas distribution systems. For a detailed description of CenterPoint Energy’s operating subsidiaries, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nHouston Electric is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, which provides electric transmission service to transmission service customers in the ERCOT region and distribution service to REPs serving the Texas Gulf Coast area that includes the city of Houston. \nCERC Corp. is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, which (i) directly owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas, (ii) indirectly, through Indiana Gas and CEOH, owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in Indiana and Ohio, respectively, and (iii) owns and operates permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through CEIP. \nOn February 19, 2024, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. \nReportable Segments\nWe discuss our operating results on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our reportable segments. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these regulated segments. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, competition, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject, among other factors. \nBelow is a summary of CenterPoint Energy’s reportable segments as of December 31, 2024. For a detailed description of the assets included in each reporting segment, see Part I, Item 1. Business.\n•\nThe Electric reportable segment includes electric transmission and distribution services that are subject to rate regulation in Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s service territories, as well as the impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility and energy delivery services to electric customers and electric generation assets to serve electric customers and optimize those assets in the wholesale power market in Indiana Electric’s service territory.\n•\nThe Natural Gas reportable segment includes (i) intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation and distribution for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas; (ii) permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through CEIP; and (iii) home appliance maintenance and repair services to customers in Minnesota and home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas through a third party.\n49\n•\nThe Corporate and Other reportable segment includes (i) energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services by Energy Systems Group through June 30, 2023, the date of the sale of Energy Systems Group; (ii)  corporate operations that support the business operations of CenterPoint Energy; and (iii) office buildings and other real estate used for business operations.\nHouston Electric and CERC each consist of a single reportable segment.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe expect our businesses to continue to be affected by the key factors and trends discussed below. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results. \nFactors Influencing Our Businesses and Industry Trends\nWe are an energy delivery company with electric transmission and distribution, power generation, and natural gas distribution operations that serve more than seven million metered customers across six jurisdictions. The majority of our revenues are generated from the transmission and delivery of electricity and the sale of natural gas by our subsidiaries.\nWe continue to execute on our strategic goals for our businesses which were set in 2021. These include our ten-year capital plan from 2021 through 2030, a focus on targeting controllable operations and maintenance savings for the benefit of our customers, prudent capital funding including divestitures of non-core assets, and net zero and GHG emissions reduction goals. Our focus continues to be on the growth of our regulated utility businesses including our electric and gas utility operations, which comprise over 95% of our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nPursuant to this business strategy and in light of the nature of our businesses, significant amounts of capital investment are reflected in our current 10-year capital plan, which has increased to nearly $47.5 billion through 2030. These investments include a focus on additional system resiliency, reliability, and grid modernization. These investments are not only intended to meet our customers’ current needs, but are also in anticipation for further organic growth and load growth from increased electrification in our service territories. To fund these capital investments, we rely on internally-generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper, cash proceeds from strategic transactions (such as the divestitures of our Arkansas and Oklahoma LDC businesses in 2022, our Energy Systems Group divestiture in 2023 and the proposed sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025), and issuances of equity and debt in the capital markets, including the issuance of non-recourse securitization bonds at Houston Electric related to costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 due to the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl. \nWe strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. Disruptions in the financial markets along with high or rising interest rates can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. In those circumstances, we may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than we would otherwise accept which, among other things, would negatively impact our ability to finance our capital plan. For that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt. \nThe regulation of electric transmission, distribution and generation facilities as well as natural gas pipelines and related facilities by federal and state regulatory agencies affects our businesses. In accordance with applicable regulations, we are making, and will continue to make, significant capital investments in our service territories under our capital plan to help operate and maintain safer, more reliable and growing electric and natural gas systems. The current economic environment (e.g., sustained higher interest rates and higher relative levels of inflation in the United States) discussed further below could result in heightened regulatory scrutiny as these regulatory agencies seek to reduce the financial impact of utility bills on customers. \nWhile greater than 80% of CenterPoint Energy’s projected consolidated investments are expected to be recovered through interim capital recovery trackers or rate cases based on a forward test year, the balance is expected to be recovered through base rate cases.\n \nIndiana Electric filed a rate case during 2023, and Houston Electric and CERC’s Ohio jurisdiction filed rate cases in 2024. The outcome of these base rate proceedings will determine, among other things, the ability to recover certain capital \n50\ninvestments within those jurisdictions. The outcome of these base rate proceedings is uncertain and may be impacted by the current economic environment. CERC’s Texas and Minnesota gas jurisdictions filed rate cases in 2023, which were settled in 2024. For additional detail, see  “—Liquidity and Capital Resources —Regulatory Matters” below.\nTo assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors the recovery of costs and return on investments by the evaluation of net income and capital expenditures, among other things, from our regulated service territories within our reportable segments. Within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, natural gas and fuel costs, interest expense, capital spend, working capital requirements, and operation and maintenance expense. In addition to these financial measures, we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to gauge the performance of our reportable segments, including the number of customers, throughput, commodity prices, heating and cooling degree days, environmental impacts, safety factors, system reliability and customer satisfaction.\nCenterPoint Energy and CERC have weather normalization or other rate mechanisms that largely mitigate the impact of weather on Natural Gas in Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota and Ohio, as applicable. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas in Texas and CenterPoint Energy’s electric operations in Texas and Indiana do not have such mechanisms, although fixed customer charges are historically higher in Texas for Natural Gas compared to its other jurisdictions. As a result, fluctuations from normal weather may have a positive or negative effect on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas’ results in Texas and on CenterPoint Energy’s electric operations’ results in its Texas and Indiana service territories. \nEach state has a unique economy and is driven by different industrial sectors. Our largest customers reflect the diversity in industries in the states across our footprint. For example, Houston Electric is largely concentrated in Houston, a diverse economy where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. Although the Houston area represents a large part of our customer base, we have a diverse customer base throughout the various states our utility businesses serve. In Minnesota, for instance, education and health services are the state’s largest sectors. Indiana and Ohio are impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest such as automotive, feed and grain processing. Some industries are driven by population growth like education and health care, while others may be influenced by strength in the national or international economy. Adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment and increased availability of alternate energy sources, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. Long-term national trends indicate residential customers have reduced their energy consumption, which could adversely affect our results. To the extent population growth is affected by lower energy prices and there is financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry, there may be an impact on the growth rate of our customer base and overall demand. Management expects residential meter growth for Houston Electric to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 2%. Management additionally anticipates significant increased electric load growth demand in our Houston Electric service territory, including in relation to the expected expansion of data centers, energy export facilities, including hydrogen facilities, electrification of industrial processes and transport and logistics. Typical customer growth in the jurisdictions served by the Natural Gas reportable segment is approximately 1%. Management expects residential meter growth for CERC to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 1%. \nInflation and high interest rates and a recessionary environment could potentially adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s ability to execute on its 10-year capital plan. The inability to execute on our capital plan may result in lost future revenues for CenterPoint Energy. Additionally, these economic conditions may affect customers’ ability to pay their utility bills which may preclude our ability to collect balances due from such customers.\nFurther, the global supply chain has experienced significant disruptions due to a multitude of factors, such as geopolitical and economic uncertainty, regulatory and political instability, import tariffs and trade agreements, labor shortages, resource availability, long lead times, manufacturer production limitations, delivery delays, inflation and severe weather events. These disruptions have adversely impacted the utility industry. Like many of our peers, we have experienced disruptions to our supply chain, as well as increased prices, and may continue to experience such disruptions in the future. For example, President Trump has expressed a desire to impose substantial new or increased tariffs, and in February 2025, imposed tariffs on several countries and certain imports into the United States. These tariffs, as well as any new legislation, tariffs, bans, potential retaliatory trade measures taken against the United States or related governmental action, could increase or cause volatility in the cost of and negatively impact our ability to procure materials, supplies (such as natural gas) or services necessary for our business and capital plan, lead to scarcity of resources and labor necessary for our business and capital plan, further extend lead time or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain and our ability to timely execute our capital plan. To the extent adverse economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, affect our suppliers and customers as well as our ability to meet our capital plan and generation transition plan, including with respect to developing and constructing new generation facilities at the cost and scale and on the timelines that we anticipate, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. For more information, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. \n51\nFurther, in response to concerns for protecting the environment, we have strived to take a leading stance in the transition to safer and cleaner energy by being the first combined electric and natural gas utility with regulated generation assets to adopt net zero for its Scope 1 and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035 goals. In addition, we set a Scope 3 emission reduction goal across our multi-state footprint by committing to help our residential and commercial customers reduce GHG emissions attributable to their end use of natural gas by 20% to 30% by 2035 from a 2021 baseline. Our capital plan supports these goals. For more information regarding CenterPoint Energy’s net zero and GHG emissions reduction goals and the risks associated with them, see Part I,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A of this report. \nCertain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money\n Certain provisions in certain note purchase agreements relating to debt issued by CERC have the effect of restricting the amount of secured debt issued by CERC and debt issued by subsidiaries of CERC Corp. Additionally, Houston Electric and SIGECO are limited in the amount of mortgage bonds they can issue by the General Mortgage and SIGECO’s mortgage indenture, respectively. For information about the total debt to capitalization financial covenants in the Registrants’ and SIGECO’s revolving credit facilities, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the Registrants’ financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on the Registrants’ financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. The Registrants base their estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Registrants’ operating environment changes. Our management believes the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates \n84\nhave been reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors. For a complete discussion of the Registrants’ significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for Rate Regulation\nAccounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. CenterPoint Energy, for its Electric and Natural Gas reportable segments, Houston Electric and CERC apply this accounting guidance. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, the Registrants would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. For further detail on the Registrants’ regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill\nThe Registrants review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually, goodwill is tested for impairment as required by accounting guidance for goodwill.  Unforeseen events, changes in market conditions, and probable regulatory disallowances, where applicable, could have a material effect on the value of long-lived assets, including goodwill, future cash flows, interest rate, and regulatory matters, and could result in an impairment charge. The Registrants recorded no impairments to long-lived assets, including goodwill during 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nFair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.\nFair value measurements require significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Determining the discount rates for the businesses that are not rate-regulated, such as for Energy Systems Group prior to the sale in June 2023, requires the estimation of the appropriate company-specific risk premiums for such businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks, which includes expectations about future market or economic conditions existing on the date of the impairment test. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on results of the impairment tests. \nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nCenterPoint Energy and CERC completed their 2024 annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2024 and determined, based on a qualitative assessment, that no goodwill impairment charge was required for any reporting unit. No qualitative factors were present that indicated impairment of CenterPoint Energy or CERC reporting units.\nAlthough no goodwill impairment resulted from the 2024 annual test, an interim goodwill impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, if CenterPoint Energy’s market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time, or events affecting a reporting unit such as a contemplated disposal of all or part of a reporting unit.\nAssets Held for Sale\nGenerally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell, and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. The Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale, or the disposal group, at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell.\n \nIf the disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, \n85\nthe goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. Goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business.\n \nAs described further in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, certain assets and liabilities of the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses met the held for sale criteria and the goodwill attributable to these businesses as of December 31, 2024 was $217 million and $122 million for CenterPoint Energy and CERC, respectively.\nAccounting for Securitization of Coal Generation Facility Retirements\nAccounting guidance for rate regulated long-lived asset abandonment requires that the carrying value of an operating asset or an asset under construction is removed from property, plant and equipment when it becomes probable that the asset will be abandoned. The Registrants recognize a loss on abandonment when they conclude it is probable the cost will not be recovered in future rates. When the Registrants conclude it is probable that costs will be recovered in future rates, a regulatory asset is recognized. The portion of property, plant and equipment that will remain used and useful until abandonment and recovered through depreciation expense in rates will continue to be classified as property, plant and equipment until the asset is abandoned. The Registrants evaluate if an adjustment to the estimated life of the asset and, accordingly, the rate of depreciation, is required to recover the asset while it is still providing service. Determining probability of abandonment or probability of recovery requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. \nIn connection with the securitization financing of qualified costs in the second quarter of 2023 associated with the completed retirement of SIGECO’s A.B. Brown coal generation facilities, CenterPoint Energy evaluated the VIE consisting of the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity, for possible consolidation, including review of qualitative factors such as  the power to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE. CenterPoint Energy has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE and is most closely associated with the VIE as compared to other interests held by the holders of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds. CenterPoint Energy is, therefore, considered the primary beneficiary and consolidated the VIE.\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, the Registrants consider cash equivalents to be short-term, highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents held by the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary solely to support servicing the SIGECO Securitization Bonds as of December 31, 2024 are reflected on CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn connection with the issuance of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds, CenterPoint Energy was required to establish a restricted cash account to collateralize the SIGECO Securitization Bonds that were issued in the financing transaction. The restricted cash account is not available for withdrawal until the maturity of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds and is not included in cash and cash equivalents.\nUnbilled Revenues\nRevenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through AMS meter communications or manual readings. At the end of each month, deliveries to non-AMS customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Information regarding deliveries to AMS customers after the last billing is obtained from actual AMS meter usage data. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual AMS meter data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nCenterPoint Energy sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. CenterPoint Energy uses several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to its plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected \n86\nreturn on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, CenterPoint Energy’s actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other retirement plans expense recorded. Read “— Other Significant Matters — Pension Plans” for further discussion.\n \nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 2(q) to the consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect the Registrants.\nOTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS\nPension Plans (CenterPoint Energy).\n  As discussed in Note 8(b) to the consolidated financial statements, CenterPoint Energy maintains non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plans are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under ERISA and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes.\n \nUnder the terms of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans, it reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. CenterPoint Energy’s funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA.\n \nAdditionally, CenterPoint Energy maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans which allow participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under the non-contributory qualified pension plan except for federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. \nCenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements and employer contributions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nCenterPoint Energy\n(in millions)\nMinimum funding requirements for qualified pension plans\n$\n23 \n$\n— \n$\n— \nEmployer contributions to the qualified pension plans\n23 \n24 \n27 \nEmployer contributions to the non-qualified pension plans\n7 \n8 \n8 \nCenterPoint Energy expects to make contributions of approximately $105 million and $7 million to the qualified and non-qualified pension plans in 2025, respectively.\nChanges in pension obligations and plan assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants.\n \nAs the sponsor of a plan, CenterPoint Energy is required to (a) recognize on its Consolidated Balance Sheet an asset for the plan’s over-funded status or a liability for the plan’s under-funded status, (b) measure a plan’s assets and obligations as of the end of the fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of the plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and, when related to its rate-regulated utilities with recoverability of cost, to regulatory assets.\nThe projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impacts resulting from increases in discount rates were offset by the changes in demographic and expected versus actual returns on assets. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans by $345 million. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during \n87\na year could materially, positively or negatively, change the funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions at the next remeasurement.\n \nHouston Electric and CERC participate in CenterPoint Energy’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans covering substantially all employees. Pension cost by Registrant was as follows for the periods presented: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\n(in millions)\nPension cost \n$\n51 \n$\n23 \n$\n18 \n$\n53 \n$\n27 \n$\n19 \n$\n172 \n$\n59 \n$\n88 \nThe calculation of pension cost and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy’s qualified pension plans had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00%, which is 50 basis points higher than the 6.50% rate assumed as of December 31, 2023. The expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class. CenterPoint Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 5.60%, which is 65 basis points higher than the 4.95% discount rate assumed as of December 31, 2023 attributed primarily to rising interest rates. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of CenterPoint Energy’s plans.\n \nCenterPoint Energy’s actuarially determined pension and other postemployment cost for 2024 and 2023 that is greater or less than the amounts being recovered through rates in the majority of Texas jurisdictions is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, respectively.  Pension cost for 2025, including the non-qualified benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $49 million before applicable regulatory deferrals and capitalization, based on an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% and a discount rate of 5.60% as of December 31, 2024. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 50 basis points from 7.00% to 6.50%, the 2025 pension cost would increase by approximately $6 million.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the pension plans projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded non-qualified pension plans, exceeded plan assets by $345 million.  If the discount rate were lowered by 50 basis points from 5.60% to 5.10%, CenterPoint Energy’s projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately $60 million and its 2025 pension cost would decrease by approximately $2 million. The expected reduction in pension cost due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments. In addition, the assumption change would impact CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2024 by $54 million and would result in an incremental charge to comprehensive income in 2024 of $5 million, net of tax of $1 million, due to the increase in the projected benefit obligation. \nFuture changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plans will impact CenterPoint Energy’s future pension expense and liabilities. CenterPoint Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.\nItem 7A.\n     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nImpact of Changes in Interest Rates, Equity Prices and Energy Commodity Prices\nThe Registrants are exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements. Most of the revenues and income from the Registrants’ business activities are affected by market risks. Categories of market risk include exposure to  interest rates, equity prices and commodity prices through non-trading activities. A description of each market risk is set forth below:\n88\n•\nInterest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates;\n•\nEquity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities (CenterPoint Energy); and\n•\nCommodity price risk results from exposures to price volatilities of commodities, such as natural gas, NGLs and other energy commodities (CenterPoint Energy).\nManagement has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks.\nInterest Rate Risk \n \n As of December 31, 2024, the Registrants had outstanding long-term debt and lease obligations and CenterPoint Energy had obligations under its ZENS that subject them to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. The Registrants seek to manage interest rate exposure by monitoring the effects of changes in market interest rates and using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. Additionally, interest rate swaps are used to mitigate interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate. See Note 7 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements.\nCenterPoint Energy’s floating rate obligations aggregated $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. If the floating interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points from December 31, 2024 rates, CenterPoint Energy’s combined interest expense would increase by approximately $15 million annually.\nHouston Electric’s floating rate obligations aggregated $500 million as of December 31, 2024, which mature on December 24, 2025. Houston Electric had no floating rate notes as of December 31, 2023. \nCERC’s floating rate obligations aggregated $599 million and $484 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. If the floating interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points from December 31, 2024 rates, CERC’s combined interest expense would increase by approximately $6 million annually. CERC has no floating rate notes maturing in 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, CenterPoint Energy had outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding indexed debt securities) aggregating $19.7 billion and $16.9 billion, respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of $18.4 billion and $16.1 billion, respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose CenterPoint Energy to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $792 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their levels as of December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Houston Electric had outstanding fixed-rate debt aggregating $8.4 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of approximately $7.3 billion and $7 billion, respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose Houston Electric to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $398 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their levels as of December 31, 2024.  Houston Electric has no fixed-rate general mortgage bonds maturing in 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, CERC had outstanding fixed-rate debt aggregating $4.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose CERC to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $160 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their levels at December 31, 2024. CERC has $10 million fixed-rate senior notes maturing in 2025.\nIn general, such an increase in fair value previously described would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Registrants were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity.\nThe ZENS obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component. The debt component of $2 million at December 31, 2024 was a fixed-rate obligation and, therefore, did not expose CenterPoint Energy to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of the debt component would increase by less than $1 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from levels at December 31, 2024. Changes in the fair value of the derivative component, a $619 million recorded liability at December 31, 2024, are recorded in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income and, therefore, it is exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk-free interest rate. If the risk-free interest rate were to increase by 10% from December 31, 2024 levels, the fair value of the derivative component liability would decrease by approximately $1 million, which would be recorded as a gain on indexed securities in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.\n89\nEquity Market Value Risk (CenterPoint Energy)\nCenterPoint Energy is exposed to equity market value risk through its ownership of 10.2 million shares of AT&T Common, 0.9 million shares of Charter Common and 2.5 million shares of WBD Common, which CenterPoint Energy holds to facilitate its ability to meet its obligations under the ZENS. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS obligation. Changes in the fair value of the ZENS-Related Securities held by CenterPoint Energy are expected to substantially offset changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the ZENS. A decrease of 10% from the December 31, 2024 aggregate market value of these shares would result in a net loss of less than $1 million, which would be recorded on a gross basis as both a gain on indexed debt securities and as a loss on equity securities in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.\nCommodity Price Risk From Non-Trading Activities (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)\nCenterPoint Energy’s regulated operations are exposed to commodity price risk during severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and severe winter weather conditions. Severe weather events can increase commodity prices related to natural gas, coal and purchased power, which may increase our costs of providing service, and those costs may not be recoverable in rates. Recovery of cost increases driven by rising commodity prices during severe weather events could be resisted by our regulators and our regulators might attempt to deny or defer timely recovery of those costs.\nHowever, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s regulated operations in Indiana have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas, coal and purchased power for the benefit of retail customers due to current state regulations, which, subject to compliance with those regulations, allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s utility natural gas operations in Indiana have regulatory authority to lock in pricing for up to 50% of annual natural gas purchases using arrangements with an original term of up to 10 years. This authority has been utilized to secure fixed price natural gas using both physical purchases and financial derivatives.\nAlthough CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk, natural gas and coal prices have other effects on working capital requirements, interest costs, and some level of price-sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered. Constructive regulatory orders, such as those authorizing lost margin recovery, other innovative rate designs and recovery of unaccounted for natural gas and other natural gas-related expenses, also mitigate the effect natural gas costs may have on CenterPoint Energy’s financial condition. In 2008, the PUCO approved an exit of the merchant function in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Ohio natural gas service territory, allowing Ohio customers to purchase substantially all natural gas directly from retail marketers rather than from CenterPoint Energy or CERC.\n90\nItem 8.\n        Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nIndex to Financial Statements\nCenterPoint Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n9\n3\nStatements of Consolidated Income\n9\n5\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income\n9\n6\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n9\n7\nStatements of Consolidated Cash Flows\n9\n9\nStatements of Consolidated Changes in Equity\n100\nCenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC and Subsidiaries\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n10\n1\nStatements of Consolidated Income\n10\n3\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income\n10\n4\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n10\n5\nStatements of Consolidated Cash Flows\n10\n7\nStatements of Consolidated Changes in Equity\n10\n8\nCenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. and Subsidiaries \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n10\n9\nStatements of Consolidated Income\n1\n1\n1\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income\n1\n1\n2\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n1\n1\n3\nStatements of Consolidated Cash Flows\n1\n1\n5\nStatements of Consolidated Changes in Equity\n1\n1\n6\n91\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(1) Background\n1\n1\n7\n(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n11\n8\n(3) Property, Plant and Equipment\n1\n2\n2\n(4) Held for Sale and Divestitures\n1\n2\n4\n(5) Revenue Recognition\n1\n2\n6\n(6) Goodwill \n12\n9\n(7) Regulatory Matters\n1\n31\n(8) Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans and Employee Benefit Plans\n1\n3\n7\n(9) Fair Value Measurements \n1\n4\n7\n(10) Equity Securities and Indexed Debt Securities (ZENS)\n14\n9\n(11) Equity\n1\n51\n(12) Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\n1\n5\n4\n(13) Income Taxes\n1\n60\n(14) Commitments and Contingencies\n1\n6\n4\n(15) Earnings Per Share (CenterPoint Energy)\n1\n71\n(16) Reportable Segments\n1\n7\n2\n(17) Supplemental Disclosure of Cash Flow and Balance Sheet\n1\n7\n6\n(18) Related Party Transactions (Houston electric and CERC)\n1\n7\n7\n(19) Leases\n1\n7\n8\n(20) Subsequent Events\n1\n81\n92\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of\n \nincome, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nImpact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements — Refer to Note 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by regulators and commissions in various jurisdictions (collectively, the “Commissions”) that have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and gas transmission and distribution companies in those jurisdictions. Management has determined its regulated operations meet the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. The impacts of accounting for the economics of rate regulation are pervasive to the financial statements and disclosures.\nThe Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes by the Commissions. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company’s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company’s investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered in rates. The Commissions’ regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions \n93\nto be made by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about certain affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory actions on the financial statements. Management’s judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of capital investments made by the Company and (3) refunds to customers. Given that certain of management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the potential uncertainty of decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation by testing certain recorded balances and evaluating regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, filings made by the Company and intervenors, and other external information. We evaluated relevant external information and compared it to certain recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nFor certain regulatory matters, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 20, 2025\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1932.\n94\nCENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nImpact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements — Refer to Note 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (“PUCT”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric transmission and distribution companies in Texas. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. The impacts of accounting for the economics of rate regulation are pervasive to the financial statements and disclosures.\nThe Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes by the PUCT. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company’s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company’s investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered in rates. The PUCT’s regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the PUCT in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has \n101\nindicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the PUCT will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about certain affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory actions on the financial statements. Management’s judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of capital investments made by the Company, and (3) refunds to customers. Given that certain of management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of decisions by the PUCT, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the potential uncertainty of decisions by the PUCT included the following, among others:\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation by testing certain recorded balances and evaluating regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the PUCT, regulatory statutes, filings made by the Company and intervenors, and other external information. We evaluated relevant external information and compared it to certain recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nFor certain regulatory matters, we inspected the Company’s filings with the PUCT and the filings with the PUCT by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the PUCT’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 20, 2025\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1932.\n102\nCENTERPOINT ENERGY HOUSTON

accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. and subsidiaries (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc.) (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of consolidated\n \nincome, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nImpact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements — Refer to Note 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by regulators and commissions in various jurisdictions (collectively, the “Commissions”) that have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of gas transmission and distribution companies in those jurisdictions. Management has determined its regulated operations meet the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. The impacts of accounting for the economics of rate regulation are pervasive to the financial statements and disclosures.\nThe Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes by the Commissions. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company’s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company’s investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered in rates. The Commissions’ regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the \n109\namount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about certain affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory actions on the financial statements. Management’s judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of capital investments made by the Company and (3) refunds to customers. Given that certain of management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the potential uncertainty of decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation by testing certain recorded balances and evaluating regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, filings made by the Company and intervenors, and other external information. We evaluated relevant external information and compared it to certain recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nFor certain regulatory matters, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 20, 2025\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1997.\n110\nCENTERPOINT ENERGY RESOURCES CORP.

For additional information, see Note 4.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The accounts of the Registrants and their wholly-owned and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation; however, intercompany profits have not been eliminated when such amounts are probable of recovery under the affiliates’ rate regulation process.\n117\nAs of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and SIGECO had VIEs including Bond Company IV and the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary, which are consolidated. The consolidated VIEs are wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entities that were formed solely for the purpose of securitizing transition property or facilitating the securitization financing of qualified costs. CenterPoint Energy, through SIGECO, has a controlling financial interest in the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary and is the VIE’s primary beneficiary. For further information, see Note 7. Houston Electric has a controlling financial interest in Bond Company IV and is the VIE’s primary beneficiary. Creditors of CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and SIGECO have no recourse to any assets or revenues of Bond Company IV or the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary, as applicable. The Securitization Bonds issued by these VIEs are payable only from and secured by transition or securitization property, as applicable, and the bondholders have no recourse to the general credit of CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric or SIGECO.\n(2)   \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \n \n(a)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n(b)\nRevenues\nThe Registrants record revenue for electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services under the accrual method and these revenues are recognized upon delivery to customers. Electricity deliveries not billed by month-end are accrued based on actual AMS meter data, supply volumes, estimated line loss and applicable tariff rates. Natural gas sales not billed by month-end are accrued based upon estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and currently effective tariff rates. For further discussion, see Note 5.\n(c) \nMISO Transactions\nIndiana Electric is a member of the MISO. MISO-related purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by the MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on at least a net hourly position, in which net purchases within that interval are recorded as Utility natural gas, fuel and purchased power and net sales within that interval are recorded as Utility revenues on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income. On occasion, prior period transactions are resettled outside the routine process due to a change in the MISO’s tariff or a material interpretation thereof. Expenses associated with resettlements are recorded once the resettlement is probable and the resettlement amount can be estimated. Revenues associated with resettlements are recognized when the amount is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\n(d) \nEnvironmental Costs\nThe Registrants (i) expense or capitalize environmental expenditures, as appropriate, depending on their future economic benefit; (ii) expense amounts that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not have future economic benefit; and (iii) record undiscounted liabilities related to these future costs when environmental assessments and/or remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.\n(e) \nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, the Registrants consider cash equivalents to be short-term, highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Bond Companies and the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary (VIEs) solely to support servicing the Securitization Bonds as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are reflected on CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn connection with the issuance of Securitization Bonds, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric were required to establish restricted cash accounts to collateralize the bonds that were issued in these financing transactions. These restricted cash accounts are not available for withdrawal until the maturity of the bonds and are not included in cash and cash equivalents.\n For more information on restricted cash, see Note 17.\n118\n(f) \nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Management reviews historical write-offs, current available information and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate and establish allowance for credit losses. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when management determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. See Note 7 for further information about regulatory deferrals of bad debt expense, including those related to COVID-19 and the February 2021 Winter Storm Event.\n(g) \nInventory\nThe Registrants’ inventory consists principally of materials and supplies, and for CERC, natural gas, and for CenterPoint Energy, coal inventory. Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market, are recorded to inventory when purchased and subsequently charged to expense or capitalized to plant when installed. Inventory related to CenterPoint Energy’s regulated operations is valued at historical cost consistent with ratemaking treatment. Coal inventory is valued at average cost. Certain natural gas in storage at CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s utilities are recorded using the last in, first out (LIFO) method. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s balances in inventory that were valued using LIFO method were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023 (1)\n2024\n2023 (1)\nCenterPoint Energy\nCERC\n(in millions)\nLIFO inventory\n$\n94\n \n$\n106\n \n$\n73\n \n$\n86\n \n(1)\nBased on the average cost of gas purchased during December 2024, CenterPoint Energy’s cost of replacing inventories carried at LIFO cost was $\n1\n million less than the carrying value at December 31, 2024. CERC’s cost of replacing inventories carried at LIFO cost was $\n4\n million more than the carrying value at December 31, 2024.\n(h) \nLong-lived Assets \nThe Registrants record property, plant and equipment at historical cost and expense repair and maintenance costs as incurred.\nThe Registrants periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. For rate-regulated businesses, recoverability of long-lived assets is assessed by determining if a capital disallowance from a regulator is probable through monitoring the outcome of rate cases and other proceedings. For businesses that are not rate-regulated, recoverability is assessed based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets compared to the carrying value of the assets. No long-lived asset impairments were recorded in 2024, 2023 or 2022. \nThe Registrants compute depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method based on economic lives or regulatory-mandated recovery periods. Amortization expense includes amortization of certain regulatory assets.\n(i) Goodwill\nCenterPoint Energy and CERC perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually and evaluate goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a quantitative test. If CenterPoint Energy or CERC chooses to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative test, if required, is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is primarily determined based on an income approach or a weighted combination of income and market approaches. When the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the excess amount is recorded as an impairment charge, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. CenterPoint Energy includes deferred tax assets and liabilities within its reporting unit’s carrying value for the purposes of annual and interim impairment tests, regardless of whether the estimated fair value reflects the disposition of such assets and liabilities.\n For further information about the goodwill impairment tests, see Note 6.\n119\n(j) \nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe Registrants apply the guidance for accounting for regulated operations within the Electric reportable segment and the Natural Gas reportable segment. The Registrants’ rate-regulated subsidiaries may collect revenues subject to refund pending final determination in rate proceedings. In connection with such revenues, estimated rate refund liabilities are recorded which reflect management’s current judgment of the ultimate outcomes of the proceedings. \nThe Registrants’ rate-regulated businesses recognize removal costs as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with regulatory treatment. In addition, a portion of the amount of removal costs collected from customers that relate to AROs has been reflected as an asset retirement liability in accordance with accounting guidance for AROs.\nFor further detail on the Registrants’ regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 7.\n(k) \nCapitalization and Deferral of Interest, including AFUDC\nThe Registrants capitalize interest and AFUDC as a component of projects under construction and amortize it over the assets’ estimated useful lives once the assets are placed in service. Additionally, the Registrants defer interest costs into a regulatory asset when amounts are probable of recovery. Deferred debt interest is amortized over the recovery period for rate-making purposes. AFUDC represents the composite interest cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable return on the equity funds used for construction for subsidiaries that apply the guidance for accounting for regulated operations. Although AFUDC increases both property, plant and equipment and earnings, it is realized in cash when the assets are included in rates. The table below includes interest capitalized or deferred for the periods presented:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nCenterPoint Energy \nHouston Electric\nCERC \nCenterPoint Energy \nHouston Electric\nCERC \nCenterPoint Energy \nHouston Electric\nCERC \n \n(in millions)\nCapitalized interest and AFUDC debt (1) \n$\n33\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n7\n \nAFUDC equity (2)\n66\n \n33\n \n17\n \n62\n \n32\n \n14\n \n37\n \n24\n \n5\n \nDeferred debt interest (3)\n65\n \n24\n \n36\n \n65\n \n16\n \n43\n \n51\n \n12\n \n36\n \n(1)\nIncluded in Interest expense and other finance charges on the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income.\n(2)\nIncluded in Other income (expense), net on the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income.\n(3)\nRepresents the amount on certain regulatory assets that are authorized to earn a return, such as debt post in-service carrying costs on property, plant and equipment, gas costs, storm restoration costs, and TEEEF (including returns on both regulatory and lease assets) and is included in Interest expense and other finance charges on the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income.\n(l) \nLeases\nAn arrangement is determined to be a lease at inception based on whether the Registrant has the right to control the use of an identified asset. ROU assets represent the Registrants’ right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Registrants’ obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, including payments at commencement that depend on an index or rate. Most leases in which the Registrants are the lessee do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, so an incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at the lease commencement date, is utilized to determine the present value of lease payments. When a secured borrowing rate is not readily available, unsecured borrowing rates are adjusted for the effects of collateral to determine the incremental borrowing rate. Each Registrant uses the implicit rate for agreements in which it is a lessor. Lease income and expense for operating leases and ROU amortization for finance leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Registrants have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for certain classes of leases, such as office buildings and temporary generation. For classes of leases in which lease and non-lease components are not combined, consideration is allocated between components based on the stand-alone prices. Sublease income is not significant to the Registrants.\n120\nThe Registrants’ lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material restrictions or material covenants. Except as described in Note 18, there are no lease transactions between related parties. Agreements in which the Registrants are lessors do not include provisions for the lessee to purchase the assets. Because risk is minimal, the Registrants do not take any significant actions to manage risk associated with the residual value of their leased assets.\nThe Registrants’ operating lease agreements are primarily equipment and real property leases, including land and office facility leases. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric also have finance lease agreements for temporary generation. The Registrants’ lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that those options will be exercised. The Registrants have elected an accounting policy that exempts leases with terms of one year or less from the recognition requirements of ASC 842.\n(m) \nIncome Taxes\nHouston Electric and CERC are included in CenterPoint Energy’s U.S. federal consolidated income tax return. Houston Electric and CERC report their income tax provision on a separate entity basis pursuant to a tax sharing policy with CenterPoint Energy. Current federal and certain state income taxes are payable to or receivable from CenterPoint Energy.\nThe Registrants use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets for which management believes realization is not considered to be more likely than not. The Registrants recognize interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense (benefit), as applicable, in their respective Statements of Consolidated Income.\nTo the extent certain EDIT of the Registrants’ rate-regulated subsidiaries may be recoverable or payable through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded, respectively. See Note 13 for further discussion.\nThe Registrants use the portfolio approach to recognize income tax effects on other comprehensive income from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nInvestment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over the approximate lives of the related property. Production tax credits extended by the IRA may be used to reduce current federal income taxes payable.\n \n(n) \nInvestments in Equity Securities (CenterPoint Energy)\nCenterPoint Energy reports equity securities at estimated fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any gains and losses, net of any transaction costs, are recorded as Gain (loss) on equity securities in the Statements of Consolidated Income.\n(o) \nAssets Held for Sale\nGenerally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell, and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. The Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale, or the disposal group, at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell. If a disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. Goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business.\nAs of December 31, 2024, certain assets and liabilities representing the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses met the held for sale criteria. The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes, requiring net deferred tax liabilities to be excluded from held for sale balances. For further discussion of the sale, see Note 4.\nFair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value could be different if different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques were applied.\n121\nFair value measurements require significant judgment and often unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the resulting fair value.\n(p) \nPreferred Stock and Dividends \nPreferred stock is evaluated to determine balance sheet classification, and all conversion and redemption features are evaluated for bifurcation treatment. Proceeds received net of issuance costs are recognized on the settlement date. Cash dividends become a liability once declared. Income available to common stockholders is computed by deducting from net income the dividends accumulated and earned during the period on cumulative preferred stock.\n(q) \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn December 31, 2024, the Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which updates segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures around significant segment expenses. The Registrants applied the provision retrospectively to all periods presented for each Registrants’ reportable segment as further described. See Note 16 for further discussion of our segment reporting.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (“ASU 2024-03”). This ASU improves disclosure of a public business entity’s expense by requiring disaggregated disclosure of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Registrants are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on their respective consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). This ASU enhances the transparency of income tax disclosures related to rate reconciliation and income taxes. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Registrants are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on their respective consolidated financial statements.\nManagement believes that all other recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Registrants’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.\n(3)   \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n \n(a) Property, Plant and Equipment\n \nProperty, plant and equipment includes the following: \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted Average Useful Lives\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Gross\nAccumulated Depreciation & Amortization\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Gross\nAccumulated Depreciation & Amortization\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n(in years)\n(in millions)\nCenterPoint Energy\nElectric transmission and distribution \n37\n$\n21,387\n \n$\n4,810\n \n$\n16,577\n \n$\n19,151\n \n$\n4,762\n \n$\n14,389\n \nElectric generation (1)\n25\n1,107\n \n154\n \n953\n \n1,381\n \n315\n \n1,066\n \nNatural gas distribution\n32\n16,399\n \n4,326\n \n12,073\n \n16,492\n \n4,337\n \n12,155\n \nFinance ROU asset (2)\n7.5\n662\n \n232\n \n430\n \n662\n \n136\n \n526\n \nOther property\n22\n3,112\n \n1,056\n \n2,056\n \n2,710\n \n993\n \n1,717\n \nTotal \n$\n42,667\n \n$\n10,578\n \n$\n32,089\n \n$\n40,396\n \n$\n10,543\n \n$\n29,853\n \n122\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted Average Useful Lives\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Gross\nAccumulated Depreciation & Amortization\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Gross\nAccumulated Depreciation & Amortization\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n(in years)\n(in millions)\nHouston Electric\nElectric transmission and distribution\n37\n$\n18,645\n \n$\n3,647\n \n$\n14,998\n \n$\n16,800\n \n$\n3,641\n \n$\n13,159\n \nFinance ROU asset (2)\n7.5\n662\n \n232\n \n430\n \n662\n \n136\n \n526\n \nOther property\n20\n2,443\n \n749\n \n1,694\n \n2,053\n \n692\n \n1,361\n \nTotal\n$\n21,750\n \n$\n4,628\n \n$\n17,122\n \n$\n19,515\n \n$\n4,469\n \n$\n15,046\n \nCERC \nNatural gas distribution\n32\n$\n15,474\n \n$\n4,118\n \n$\n11,356\n \n$\n15,591\n \n$\n4,136\n \n$\n11,455\n \nOther property\n11\n78\n \n28\n \n50\n \n81\n \n33\n \n48\n \nTotal \n$\n15,552\n \n$\n4,146\n \n$\n11,406\n \n$\n15,672\n \n$\n4,169\n \n$\n11,503\n \n(1)\nSIGECO and AGC owned a \n300\n MW unit at the Warrick Power Plant (Warrick Unit 4) as tenants in common as of December 31, 2023. SIGECO’s share of the cost of this unit as of December 31, 2023, was $\n198\n million with accumulated depreciation totaling $\n171\n million. Under the operating agreement, AGC and SIGECO shared equally in the cost of operation and output of the unit. SIGECO’s share of operating costs was included in Operation and maintenance expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income. SIGECO exited joint operations of Warrick Unit 4 on January 1, 2024. \n(2)\nHouston Electric recognized a finance ROU asset as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 related to temporary generation. See Note 19 for further discussion.\n(b) Depreciation and Amortization \nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization expense for 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\n \n(in millions)\nDepreciation\n$\n1,177\n \n$\n545\n \n$\n492\n \n$\n1,092\n \n$\n484\n \n$\n459\n \n$\n1,013\n \n$\n434\n \n$\n420\n \nAmortization of securitized regulatory assets\n90\n \n74\n \n—\n \n163\n \n155\n \n—\n \n191\n \n191\n \n—\n \nOther amortization\n172\n \n143\n \n30\n \n146\n \n109\n \n34\n \n84\n \n45\n \n28\n \nTotal\n$\n1,439\n \n$\n762\n \n$\n522\n \n$\n1,401\n \n$\n748\n \n$\n493\n \n$\n1,288\n \n$\n670\n \n$\n448\n \n(c) AROs\nThe Registrants account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value and its settlement date can be made. At the timing of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The Registrants recognize a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recovered through the ratemaking process. The estimates of future liabilities are developed using a discounted cash flow model based upon estimates and assumptions of future costs, interest rates, credit-adjusted risk-free rates and the estimated timing of settlement.\nThe Registrants have recorded AROs associated with the removal of asbestos and asbestos-containing material in its buildings, including substation building structures. CenterPoint Energy recorded AROs relating to the closure of the ash ponds at A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley as well as certain sites in Indiana pursuant to the CCR Legacy Rule; see Note 14(d) for further discussion. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric also recorded AROs relating to treated wood poles for electric distribution, distribution transformers containing PCB (also known as Polychlorinated Biphenyl), and underground fuel storage tanks. CenterPoint Energy and CERC also recorded AROs relating to gas pipelines abandoned in place.\nA reconciliation of the changes in the ARO liability recorded in Other non-current liabilities on each of the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:\n123\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nCenterPoint Energy \nHouston Electric\nCERC \nCenterPoint Energy \nHouston Electric\nCERC \n \n(in millions)\nBeginning balance\n$\n590\n \n$\n40\n \n$\n380\n \n$\n610\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n420\n \nAdditions\n11\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAccretion expense (1)\n21\n \n1\n \n16\n \n23\n \n1\n \n16\n \nRevisions in estimates (2)\n(\n34\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n33\n)\n(\n43\n)\n3\n \n(\n56\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n588\n \n$\n39\n \n$\n363\n \n$\n590\n \n$\n40\n \n$\n380\n \n(1)\nReflected in Regulatory assets on each of the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)\nIn 2024 and 2023, CenterPoint Energy and CERC reflected a decrease in their respective ARO liability, which was primarily attributable to increases in the long-term interest rates used for discounting in the ARO calculation. In 2024, Houston Electric reflected a decrease in its ARO liability attributable to an increase in discount rates, while in 2023, Houston Electric reflected an increase in its ARO liability attributable to an increase in discount rates and disposal costs.\n(4)   \nHeld for Sale and Divestitures (CenterPoint Energy and CERC) \nHeld for Sale.\n \nOn February 19, 2024, CERC Corp. entered into the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which CERC Corp. agreed to sell its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses. The purchase price for the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses is $\n1.2\n billion and subject to adjustment as set forth in the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on net working capital, regulatory assets and liabilities and capital expenditures at closing. The completion of the proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (ii) approval of the LPSC, (iii) approval of the MPSC, (iv) no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement) having occurred and (v) customary closing conditions regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance by the parties with the respective obligations under the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement. The proposed transaction is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025, subject to satisfaction of the foregoing conditions. The businesses include approximately \n12,000\n miles of main pipeline in Louisiana and Mississippi serving more than \n300,000\n customers. The Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses are reflected in CenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas reportable segment and CERC’s single reportable segment, as applicable. The transaction was approved by final orders issued by the MPSC on December 3, 2024 and the LPSC on December 17, 2024.\nIn February 2024, certain assets and liabilities representing the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses met the held for sale criteria. The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes, requiring net deferred tax liabilities to be excluded from held for sale balances. \nThe Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell. Neither CenterPoint Energy nor CERC recognized any gains or losses upon classification of held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2024. If a disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. See Note 6 for further disclosure regarding the amount of goodwill allocated to the businesses to be sold.\nThe assets and liabilities of the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses classified as held for sale in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as applicable, included the following:\n124\nDecember 31, 2024\nCenterPoint Energy\nCERC\n(in millions)\nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n27\n \n$\n27\n \nAccrued unbilled revenues\n26\n \n26\n \nMaterials and supplies\n13\n \n13\n \nNatural gas inventory\n5\n \n5\n \nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n1,052\n \n1,052\n \nGoodwill \n217\n \n122\n \nRegulatory assets\n15\n \n15\n \nOther\n6\n \n6\n \nTotal current assets held for sale\n$\n1,361\n \n$\n1,266\n \nShort-term borrowings\n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \nAccounts payable\n44\n \n44\n \nCustomer deposits\n14\n \n14\n \nRegulatory liabilities\n31\n \n31\n \nOther\n84\n \n84\n \nTotal current liabilities held for sale\n$\n176\n \n$\n176\n \nAlthough the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses meet the held for sale criteria, their proposed disposals do not represent a strategic shift for CenterPoint Energy and CERC as both will retain significant operations in, and will continue to invest in, their natural gas businesses. Therefore, the assets and liabilities associated with these transactions are not reflected as discontinued operations on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income, as applicable, and the December 31, 2023 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were not required to be recast for assets held for sale. Since the depreciation on the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses assets will continue to be reflected in revenues through customer rates until the expected closing of the transaction and will be reflected in the carryover basis of the rate-regulated assets once sold, CenterPoint Energy and CERC will continue to record depreciation on those assets through the expected closing of the transaction.\nThe pre-tax income for the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses, excluding interest and corporate allocations, included in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nIncome Before Income Taxes\n$\n67\n \n$\n44\n \n$\n42\n \nDivestiture of Energy Systems Group\n. \nOn May 21, 2023, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary Vectren Energy Services, entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement to sell all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Energy Systems Group to ESG Holdings Group, for a purchase price of $\n157\n million, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on Energy Systems Group’s net working capital at closing, indebtedness, cash and cash equivalents and transaction expenses. The transaction closed on June 30, 2023, and CenterPoint Energy received $\n154\n million in cash. In November 2024, CenterPoint Energy paid $\n2\n million to ESG Holdings Group for working capital and other adjustments set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement. For a discussion of CenterPoint Energy’s pre-disposition guarantees related to Energy Systems Group, see Note 14(c).\nCenterPoint Energy recognized a \nloss on sale\n of approximately $\n13\n million, including $\n3\n million of transaction costs, during the year ended December 31, 2023, in connection with the closing of the sale of Energy Systems Group. Additionally, CenterPoint Energy recognized a current tax expense of $\n32\n million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of the cash taxes payable upon the closing of the sale.\n125\nThe pre-tax income (loss) for Energy Systems Group, excluding interest and corporate allocations, included in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income is as follows: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 (1)\n2022\n(in millions)\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes\n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n2\n \n(1)\nReflects January 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023 results only due to of the sale of Energy Systems Group.\nDivestiture of Arkansas and Oklahoma Natural Gas Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).\n \nOn April 29, 2021, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the AROK Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its Arkansas and Oklahoma Natural Gas businesses for $\n2.15\n billion in cash, including recovery of approximately $\n425\n million in natural gas costs, including storm-related incremental natural gas costs associated with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the AROK Asset Purchase Agreement. The assets included approximately \n17,000\n miles of main pipeline in Arkansas, Oklahoma and certain portions of Bowie County, Texas serving more than half a million customers. The transaction closed on January 10, 2022. \nThe sale was considered an asset sale for tax purposes, requiring net deferred tax liabilities to be excluded from held for sale balances. The deferred taxes associated with the businesses were recognized as a deferred income tax benefit by CenterPoint Energy and CERC upon closing of the sale in 2022.\nCenterPoint Energy and CERC recognized gains of $\n303\n million and $\n557\n million, respectively, net of transaction costs of $\n59\n million, in connection with the closing of the disposition of the Arkansas and Oklahoma Natural Gas businesses during the year ended December 31, 2022. CenterPoint Energy and CERC collected a receivable of $\n15\n million in May 2022 for full and final settlement of the working capital adjustment under the AROK Asset Purchase Agreement.\nThe pre-tax income for the Arkansas and Oklahoma Natural Gas businesses, excluding interest and corporate allocations, included in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income was $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which only reflects January 1, 2022 to January 9, 2022 results due to the sale of the Arkansas and Oklahoma Natural Gas businesses previously described.\nEffective on the date of the closing of the disposition of the Arkansas and Oklahoma Natural Gas businesses, a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy entered into the Transition Services Agreement, whereby that subsidiary agreed to provide certain transition services such as accounting, customer operations, procurement, and technology functions for a term of up to twelve months. In November 2022, a significant majority of all services under the Transition Services Agreement were terminated, and on January 10, 2023, all remaining services were terminated. \nCenterPoint Energy’s charges to Southern Col Midco for reimbursement of transition services was less than $\n1\n million and $\n40\n million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Actual transition services costs incurred are recorded net of amounts charged to Southern Col Midco. CenterPoint Energy had \nno\n accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023 from Southern Col Midco for transition services.\n(5)   \nRevenue Recognition \nIn accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Registrants expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services. \nARPs are contracts between the utility and its regulators, not between the utility and a customer. The Registrants recognize ARP revenue as other revenues when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met. Upon recovery of ARP revenue through incorporation in rates charged for utility service to customers, ARP revenue is reversed and recorded as revenue from contracts with customers. The recognition of ARP revenues and the reversal of ARP revenues upon recovery through rates charged for utility service may not occur in the same period.\n126\n \nThe following tables disaggregate revenues by reportable segment and major source:\nCenterPoint Energy\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nElectric\nNatural Gas \nCorporate and Other \nTotal\n(in millions)\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n$\n4,558\n \n$\n3,990\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n8,552\n \nOther (1)\n32\n \n58\n \n3\n \n93\n \nEliminations\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\nTotal revenues\n$\n4,590\n \n$\n4,046\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n8,643\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nElectric\nNatural Gas\nCorporate and Other\nTotal\n(in millions)\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n$\n4,275\n \n$\n4,210\n \n$\n127\n \n$\n8,612\n \nOther (1)\n15\n \n69\n \n3\n \n87\n \nEliminations\n—\n \n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n(\n3\n)\nTotal revenues\n$\n4,290\n \n$\n4,276\n \n$\n130\n \n$\n8,696\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nElectric \nNatural Gas \nCorporate and Other \nTotal\n(in millions)\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n$\n4,095\n \n$\n4,969\n \n$\n263\n \n$\n9,327\n \nOther (1)\n13\n \n(\n23\n)\n4\n \n(\n6\n)\nTotal revenues\n$\n4,108\n \n$\n4,946\n \n$\n267\n \n$\n9,321\n \n(1)\nPrimarily consists of income from ARPs and leases.\nHouston Electric\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n$\n3,930\n \n$\n3,684\n \n$\n3,417\n \nOther (1)\n9\n \n(\n7\n)\n(\n5\n)\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,939\n \n$\n3,677\n \n$\n3,412\n \n(1)\nPrimarily consists of income from ARPs and leases.\nCERC\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n$\n3,868\n \n$\n4,083\n \n$\n4,816\n \nOther (1)\n57\n \n66\n \n(\n16\n)\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,925\n \n$\n4,149\n \n$\n4,800\n \n(1)\nPrimarily consists of income from ARPs and leases.\n127\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nElectric (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric). \nHouston Electric distributes electricity to customers over time and customers consume the electricity when delivered. Indiana Electric generates, distributes and transmits electricity to customers over time and customers consume the electricity when delivered. Revenue, consisting of both volumetric and fixed tariff rates set by state regulators, such as the PUCT and the IURC, is recognized as electricity is delivered and represents amounts both billed and unbilled. Discretionary services requested by customers are provided at a point in time with control transferring upon the completion of the service. Revenue for discretionary services provided by Houston Electric is recognized upon completion of service based on the tariff rates set by the PUCT. Payments for electricity distribution and discretionary services are aggregated and received on a monthly basis. Houston Electric performs transmission services over time as a stand-ready obligation to provide a reliable network of transmission systems. Revenue is recognized upon time elapsed and the monthly tariff rate set by the regulator. Payments are received on a monthly basis. Indiana Electric customers are billed monthly and payment terms, set by the regulator, require payment within a month of billing. \nNatural Gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC). \n CenterPoint Energy and CERC distribute and transport natural gas to customers over time and customers consume the natural gas when delivered. Revenue, consisting of both volumetric and fixed tariff rates set by the state governing agency for that service area, is recognized as natural gas is delivered and represents amounts both billed and unbilled. Discretionary services requested by the customer are provided at a point in time with control transferring upon completion of the service. Revenue for discretionary services is recognized upon completion of service based on the tariff rates set by the applicable state regulator. Payments of natural gas distribution, transportation and discretionary services are aggregated and received on a monthly basis.\nContract Balances. \nWhen the timing of delivery of service is different from the timing of the payments made by customers and when the right to consideration is conditioned on something other than the passage of time, the Registrants recognize a contract liability when customer payment precedes performance. Those customers that prepay are represented by contract liabilities until the performance obligations are satisfied. The Registrants’ contract liabilities are included in Accounts payable and Other current liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe opening and closing balances of accounts receivable, accrued unbilled revenues and contract liabilities from contracts with customers are as follows: \nCenterPoint Energy\nAccounts Receivable\nAccrued Unbilled Revenues\nContract Liabilities \n(in millions)\nOpening balance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n652\n \n$\n516\n \n$\n2\n \nClosing balance as of December 31, 2024 \n666\n \n521\n \n2\n \nIncrease\n$\n14\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n—\n \nThe amount of revenue recognized in the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n that was included in the opening contract liability was $\n2\n million. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between CenterPoint Energy’s performance and the customer’s payment.\nHouston Electric\nAccounts Receivable\nAccrued Unbilled Revenues\nContract Liabilities\n(in millions)\nOpening balance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n275\n \n$\n142\n \n$\n2\n \nClosing balance as of December 31, 2024 \n284\n \n137\n \n2\n \nIncrease (decrease)\n$\n9\n \n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n—\n \nThe amount of revenue recognized in the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n that was included in the opening contract liability was $\n2\n million. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between Houston Electric’s performance and the customer’s payment.\n128\nCERC\nAccounts Receivable\nAccrued \nUnbilled Revenues\n(in millions)\nOpening balance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n330\n \n$\n329\n \nClosing balance as of December 31, 2024 \n326\n \n338\n \nIncrease (decrease)\n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n9\n \nCERC does not have any opening or closing contract asset or contract liability balances.\nPractical Expedients and Exemption.  \nSales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers are excluded from the transaction price. \nFor contracts for which revenue from the satisfaction of the performance obligations is recognized in the amount invoiced, the practical expedient was elected and revenue expected to be recognized on these contracts has not been disclosed.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Bad Debt Expense\nCenterPoint Energy and CERC segregate financial assets that fall under the scope of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, primarily trade receivables due in one year or less, into portfolio segments based on shared risk characteristics, such as geographical location and regulatory environment, for evaluation of expected credit losses. Historical and current information, such as average write-offs, are applied to each portfolio segment to estimate the allowance for losses on uncollectible receivables. Additionally, the allowance for losses on uncollectible receivables is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, which can include changing weather, commodity prices, regulations and macroeconomic factors, among others. Houston Electric had no material changes in its methodology to recognize losses on financial assets that fall under the scope of Topic 326, primarily due to the nature of its customers and regulatory environment.

The weighted average recovery period of regulatory assets currently being recovered in base rates, not earning a return, which totals $\n424\n million, $\n63\n million and $\n328\n million for CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC, respectively, is \n11\n years, \n27\n years and \n7\n years, respectively. Regulatory assets not earning a return with perpetual or undeterminable lives have been excluded from the weighted average recovery period calculation.\n(6)\nCurrent regulatory liabilities are included in Other current liabilities in each of the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \nThe table below reflects the amount of allowed equity return recognized by each Registrant in its Statements of Consolidated Income for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\n(in millions)\nAllowed equity return recognized\n$\n23\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n41\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n45\n \n$\n42\n \n$\n2\n \nFebruary 2021 Winter Storm Event\n \nIn February 2021, certain of the Registrants’ jurisdictions experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event that resulted in prolonged freezing temperatures, which impacted their businesses. The February 2021 Winter Storm Event impacted wholesale prices of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas purchases and their ability to serve customers in their Natural Gas service territories, including due to the reduction in available natural gas capacity and impacts to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas supply portfolio activities, and the effects of weather on their systems and their ability to transport natural gas, among other things. The overall natural gas market, including the markets from which CenterPoint Energy and CERC sourced a significant portion of their natural gas for their operations, experienced significant impacts caused by the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, resulting in extraordinary increases in the cost of natural gas purchased by CenterPoint Energy and CERC of approximately $\n2\n billion. CenterPoint Energy and CERC have completed recovery of natural gas costs in Mississippi, Indiana, Louisiana and Texas, and continue to recover the natural gas cost in Minnesota. As of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy and CERC had each recorded current regulatory assets of $\n67\n million and non-current regulatory assets of $\n67\n million associated with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event. As of December 31, 2023, CenterPoint Energy and CERC have each recorded current regulatory assets of $\n86\n million and non-current regulatory assets of $\n130\n million associated with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event.\nIn Minnesota, the MPUC issued its written order on October 19, 2022 disallowing CERC’s recovery of approximately $\n36\n million of the $\n409\n million incurred, and CERC’s regulatory asset balance was reduced to reflect the disallowance. CERC filed a petition for reconsideration on November 8, 2022 and a written order denying the petition for reconsideration was issued on January 6, 2023. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as authorized by the PUCT, both CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric had each recorded a regulatory asset of $\n8\n million for bad debt expenses resulting from REPs’ default on their obligation to pay delivery charges to Houston Electric net of collateral. Additionally, both CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric had each recorded a regulatory asset of $\n19\n million and $\n17\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and requested reimbursement of costs associated with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event in Houston Electric’s rate case, which was filed in March 2024.   On January 29, 2025 Houston Electric announced that a settlement agreement was reached with certain parties to the rate case filed on March 6, 2024, including the City of Houston and other regional municipalities. Subject to PUCT review and approval, the settlement is expected to result in approximately $\n50\n million less annual revenue and an average decrease of approximately $\n1\n a month for residential customers based on average usage of \n1,000\n kWh per month.\nSee Note 14(d) for further information regarding litigation related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event.\n133\nTexas Public Securitization\nThe Texas Natural Gas Securitization Finance Corporation issued customer rate relief bonds in March 2023, and on March 23, 2023, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, collectively, received approximately $\n1.1\n billion in cash proceeds from the issuance and sale of the state’s customer rate relief bonds. The proceeds from the state’s customer rate relief bonds included carrying costs incurred through August 2022. Incremental carrying costs incurred after August 2022 until the date the proceeds were received are recorded in a separate regulatory asset; the most recent CERC rate proceeding in Texas included a request for recovery of this regulatory asset and was included in the settlement agreement approved by the Railroad Commission in June 2024. As CenterPoint Energy and CERC have no future financial obligations for the repayment of the state’s customer rate relief bonds, the customer rate relief bonds are not recorded on CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s balance sheets. The state’s customer rate relief bonds are backed in part by customer rate relief property, including customer rate relief charges, which are non-bypassable uniform monthly volumetric charges to be paid by all existing and future sales customers as a component of each regulated utility’s gas cost, separate from their base rate. CERC only acts as a collection agent, whose duties include management, servicing and administration of a portion of the customer rate relief property which is associated with the customer rate relief charge imposed on customers of CERC under the guidance and direction from the Railroad Commission. The Texas Natural Gas Securitization Finance Corporation, and not CenterPoint Energy or CERC, is the owner of the customer rate relief property. The assets of the Texas Natural Gas Securitization Finance Corporation are not available to pay creditors of CenterPoint Energy, CERC, or their affiliates. While the customer rate relief charges will be included by CERC in their monthly billings, the billing amount is established by the Railroad Commission. CERC will remit all customer rate relief charges collected to the financing entity set up by the Railroad Commission. Therefore, the collection and servicing of customer rate relief charges have no impact on the respective Statements of Consolidated Income of CenterPoint Energy or CERC. \nAs U.S. GAAP has no specific accounting guidance for government grants or assistance, the cash proceeds from the state’s customer rate relief bonds were accounted for as a government grant by analogy to the grant model under IAS 20—Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance. CenterPoint Energy and CERC reflect the proceeds from the grant as a deduction to natural gas costs and recognized the $\n1.1\n billion of cash proceeds from the state’s customer rate relief bonds within Utility natural gas expense on their respective Statements of Consolidated Income in the year ended December 31, 2023, net of the recognition of natural gas cost related to relieving CenterPoint Energy and CERC’s regulatory assets related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event in the same period.\nIndiana Electric Securitization of Generation Retirements (CenterPoint Energy)\nOn January 4, 2023, the IURC issued an order in accordance with Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 386 authorizing the issuance of up to $\n350\n million in securitization bonds to securitize qualified costs associated with the retirements of Indiana Electric’s\n \nA.B. Brown coal-fired generation facilities. Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy determined that the retirement of property, plant and equipment became probable upon the issuance of the order. No loss on abandonment was recognized in connection with issuance of the order as there was no disallowance of all or part of the cost of the abandoned property, plant and equipment. In the first quarter of 2023, upon receipt of the order, CenterPoint Energy reclassified property, plant and equipment to be recovered through securitization to a regulatory asset and such amounts continued to earn a full return until recovered through securitization.\nThe SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary issued $\n341\n million aggregate principal amount of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds on June 29, 2023. The SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance\n \nof the SIGECO Securitization Bonds to purchase the securitization property from SIGECO. No gain or loss was recognized.\nThe SIGECO Securitization Bonds are secured by the securitization property, which includes the right to recover, through non-bypassable securitization charges payable by SIGECO’s retail electric customers, the qualified costs of SIGECO authorized by the IURC order. The SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary, and not SIGECO, is the owner of the securitization property, and the assets of the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary are not available to pay the creditors of SIGECO or its affiliates, other than the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary. SIGECO has no payment obligations with respect to the SIGECO Securitization Bonds except to remit collections of securitization charges as set forth in a servicing agreement between SIGECO and the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary. The non-bypassable securitization charges are subject to a true-up mechanism.\nHouston Electric TEEEF\nPursuant to legislation passed in 2021, Houston Electric entered into \ntwo\n leases for TEEEF (temporary generation) which are detailed in Note 19. Houston Electric initially sought recovery of the lease costs and the applicable return as of December 31, 2021 under these lease agreements of approximately $\n200\n million in its DCRF application filed with the PUCT on April 5, \n134\n2022, and subsequently amended on July 1, 2022, to show temporary generation in a separate Rider TEEEF. A final order was issued on April 5, 2023 approving a revenue requirement of $\n39\n million that results in full recovery of costs requested but lengthens the amortization period for the short-term lease to be collected over \n82.5\n months. On May 25, 2023, the PUCT issued its order on rehearing which clarified some of the findings but did not change the approval of TEEEF cost recovery. The PUCT’s decision on the first TEEEF filing is now final and non-appealable.\nOn April 5, 2023, Houston Electric made its second TEEEF filing requesting recovery of TEEEF related costs incurred through December 31, 2022, which requested a new annual revenue requirement of approximately $\n188\n million \nu\nsing \n78\n months to amortize the related deferred costs for proposed rates beginning September 2023, a net increase in TEEEF revenues of approximately $\n149\n million\n.\n On August 28, 2023, the State Office of Administrative Hearings issued an Order setting interim rates to collect an annual revenue requirement at the filed amount. Interim rates became effective on September 1, 2023, subject to surcharge or refund if they differ from the final rates approved by the PUCT. An agreement in principle was reached which reduced the annual revenue requirement by approximately $\n35\n million based on recovering the balance as of December 31, 2022 over a \n102-month\n amortization period (instead of the \n78-month\n period in the initial filing) and also allowed for revised interim rates (to incorporate the agreement in principle and the initial interim rates that have been in place since September 1, 2023). The updated interim rates were implemented on December 15, 2023 and approved by the PUCT pursuant to its order issued on February 1, 2024 when the PUCT approved the agreement in principle. The PUCT’s decision on the second TEEEF filing is final and non-appealable.\nOn September 11, 2024, the TCA filed a complaint with the PUCT requesting that the PUCT modify its rulings with respect to its prior decisions related to the TEEEF filings made in 2022 and 2023. Specifically, TCA requested that the PUCT end cost recovery and return on investment on all the large \n32\n MW and \n5\n MW TEEEF units approved in docket 53442. On October 2, 2024, Houston Electric filed a response to the TCA complaint and requested that the complaint be dismissed due to the principles of \nres judicata\n and collateral estoppel. On October 8, 2024, TCA supplemented its complaint and on October 9, 2024, PUCT staff filed a statement of position stating that Houston Electric’s response provided a strong argument for dismissal of the complaint, but also stating that it would be prudent to have a thorough legal argument from TCA. On October 10, 2024, PUCT issued Order No. 2 finding the TCA complaint insufficient and requiring supplemental information or amendment from TCA by October 24, 2024; TCA filed supplemental information on October 24, 2024. On November 14, 2024, PUCT issued Order No. 4 denying the motion to reconsider and extending a deadline. On December 16, 2024, PUCT issued Order No. 5 granting waiver of the requirement for informal disposition and soliciting commission staff recommendation by January 16, 2025. On January 16, 2025, PUCT staff filed a supplemental recommendation recommending that the TCA has not met its requirement to first present its complaint to the City of Houston prior to presenting it to the PUCT. On January 17, 2025 the case was abated until February 28, 2025 to enable the TCA to present its complaint to the City of Houston.\nOn December 19, 2024, Houston Electric announced a proposal to release Houston Electric’s 15 large 27 MW to 32 MW TEEEF units to the San Antonio area prior to the summer of 2025. The proposal is intended to help ERCOT address a potential energy shortfall and Load Shed risk and to provide additional electric generation capacity to support growing energy demand in the greater San Antonio region.\n \nUnder the proposal, Houston Electric would not receive revenue or profit from ERCOT and would also not charge Houston-area customers for these TEEEF units for the period when they are in San Antonio serving ERCOT, which is currently expected to be for a period of up to  two years. Houston Electric would anticipate receiving revenues from one or more future transactions after the period the units are utilized to temporarily serve an energy need in the San Antonio area, and would therefore plan to continue to not charge customers for these units for any future periods. The proposal has not been finalized and is subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation among the relevant parties, as well as being subject to the approval of ERCOT and other stakeholders.  It is not certain that mutually agreeable definitive documentation will be entered into at all or that all approvals will be obtained.\nHouston Electric defers costs associated with the short-term and long-term leases that are probable of recovery and would otherwise be charged to expense in a regulatory asset, including allowed debt returns, and determined that such regulatory assets remain probable of recovery as of December 31, 2024. Right of use finance lease assets, such as assets acquired under the long-term leases, are evaluated for impairment under the long-lived asset impairment model by assessing if a capital disallowance from a regulator is probable through monitoring the outcome of rate cases and other proceedings. Houston Electric did not record any impairments on its right of use assets or regulatory asset in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. See Note 19 for further information.\nMay 2024 Storm Events\n \nHouston Electric’s service territory experienced sudden and destructive severe weather events in May 2024 that included hurricane-like winds and tornadoes. The May 2024 Storm Events caused significant damage to Houston Electric’s electric \n135\ndelivery system. As of December 31, 2024, Houston Electric had recorded $\n345\n million in Property, plant and equipment and $\n73\n million in Regulatory assets, excluding carrying costs, for such restoration costs. Based on currently available information, as of December 31, 2024, Houston Electric estimates that total costs to restore the electric delivery facilities damaged as a result of the May 2024 Storm Events will be approximately $\n458\n million, excluding carrying costs. These preliminary estimates are subject to revision as certain restoration costs are expected to be incurred through the end of 2025.\nAs is common with electric utilities serving coastal regions, the poles, towers, wires, street lights and pole-mounted equipment that comprise Houston Electric’s transmission and distribution system are not covered by property insurance. Houston Electric is deferring certain storm restoration costs as management believes it is probable that such costs will be recovered through the regulatory process. On November 8, 2024, Houston Electric filed an Application for Determination of System Restoration Costs with the PUCT. The application seeks a determination as to the reasonableness and necessity of approximately $\n502\n million of costs (including estimated case processing expenses and carrying costs) incurred or expected to be incurred to restore service following the May 2024 Storm Events. On January 10, 2025, intervenors filed testimony recommending various disallowances ranging from $\n4.1\n million to $\n101.9\n million. On January 17, 2025, PUCT staff filed testimony recommending no adjustments to Houston Electric’s request. Houston Electric’s rebuttal testimony was filed January 21, 2025. On January 29, 2025, the parties represented to the ALJ that a settlement in principle had been reached and requested an abatement to memorialize and finalize the settlement. The case was abated and parties will file finalized settlement documents or a status update by February 26, 2025. Prior to authorizing Houston Electric to recover these costs, the PUCT must first determine the amount of reasonable and necessary system restoration costs. On January 24, 2025, Houston Electric filed a request for a Financing Order for the distribution costs included in the November 8, 2024 Application for Determination of System Restoration Costs. The ultimate recovery of the costs (or a portion thereof) is expected to be sought through the issuance and sale of non-recourse securitization bonds for distribution-related costs and the TCOS capital mechanism for transmission-related costs. However, neither the amount nor timing of the recovery is certain.\nSee Note 12 for further information regarding a term loan facility to fund certain costs related to the May 2024 Storm Events.\nHurricane Beryl\nOn July 8, 2024, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in Texas, bringing sustained winds, storm surges and torrential rain into Houston Electric’s service territory. Hurricane Beryl caused significant damage to Houston Electric’s electric delivery system. Based on currently available information, as of December 31, 2024, Houston Electric estimates that total costs to restore the electric delivery facilities damaged as a result of Hurricane Beryl will be approximately $\n1.1\n billion, excluding carrying costs. As of December 31, 2024, Houston Electric had recorded $\n654\n million in Property, plant and equipment and $\n442\n million in Regulatory assets, excluding carrying costs, for such restoration costs.\nHouston Electric is deferring certain storm restoration costs as management believes it is probable that such costs will be recovered through the regulatory process. Similar to the costs related to the May 2024 Storm Events, insurance coverage was not available for damages to much of our transmission and distribution assets. The ultimate recovery of the costs (or a portion thereof) relating to Hurricane Beryl is expected to be sought through the issuance and sale of non-recourse securitization bonds for distribution-related costs. However, neither the amount nor timing of the recovery is certain.\n136\n(8)   \nStock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans and Employee Benefit Plans \n(a) Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans (CenterPoint Energy)\nCenterPoint Energy has LTIPs that provide for the issuance of stock-based incentives, including stock options, performance awards, restricted stock unit awards and restricted and unrestricted stock awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors. Approximately \n30\n million shares of Common Stock are authorized under these plans for awards. CenterPoint Energy issues new shares of its Common Stock to satisfy stock-based payments related to LTIPs. Equity awards are granted to employees without cost to the participants.\nCompensation costs for the performance awards and stock unit awards granted under LTIPs are measured using fair value and expected achievement levels on the grant date. For performance awards with operational goals, the achievement levels are revised as goals are evaluated. The fair value of awards granted to employees is based on the closing stock price of CenterPoint Energy’s Common Stock on the grant date. The compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on historical averages and estimates are updated periodically throughout the vesting period. \n \n The performance awards granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 are distributed based upon the achievement of certain performance conditions or market conditions over a \nthree-year\n performance cycle. The performance conditions are based on CenterPoint Energy’s cumulative adjusted EPS and certain carbon emissions reduction goals. The market condition is based on CenterPoint Energy’s total shareholder return relative to a specified peer group. Upon vesting, shares under the performance awards, as determined based on achievement of the applicable performance goals, are issued to the participants along with the value of dividend equivalents earned over the performance cycle.\nThe stock unit awards granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 are service based and subject to CenterPoint Energy’s achievement of positive operating income for the last full calendar year preceding the applicable vesting date. Stock units awarded in 2024 are service based, and vest under a \nthree-year\n ratable vesting schedule, with one-third vesting as of each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Each vesting is subject to the achievement of a performance goal. Stock unit awards granted to employees in 2023 and 2022 cliff vest at the end of a \nthree-year\n period. Stock unit awards granted to non-employee directors vest immediately upon grant. Upon vesting, shares under the stock unit awards are issued to the participants along with the value of dividend equivalents earned over the applicable vesting period.\nThe following table summarizes CenterPoint Energy’s expenses related to LTIPs for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nLTIP compensation expense (1)\n$\n34\n \n$\n65\n \n$\n51\n \nIncome tax benefit recognized\n8\n \n15\n \n12\n \nActual tax benefit realized for tax deductions\n19\n \n17\n \n6\n \n(1)\nIncluded in Operation and maintenance expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, net of any amounts capitalized.\n \n137\nThe following tables summarize CenterPoint Energy’s LTIP activity for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n \nShares\n(Thousands)\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nRemaining Average\nContractual\nLife (Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue (2) (Millions)\nPerformance Awards\n (1)\nOutstanding and nonvested as of December 31, 2023\n5,225\n \n$\n25.95\n \n \n \nGranted\n1,727\n \n27.92\n \n \n \nForfeited or canceled\n(\n220\n)\n28.09\n \n \n \nVested and released to participants\n(\n1,824\n)\n21.87\n \n \n \nOutstanding and nonvested as of December 31, 2024\n4,908\n \n$\n28.14\n \n1\n$\n105\n \nStock Unit Awards\nOutstanding and nonvested as of December 31, 2023\n1,861\n \n$\n26.91\n \nGranted\n438\n \n28.25\n \nForfeited or canceled\n(\n43\n)\n27.92\n \nVested and released to participants\n(\n1,139\n)\n25.92\n \nOutstanding and nonvested as of December 31, 2024\n1,117\n \n$\n28.20\n \n0.5\n$\n36\n \n \n(1)\nReflects maximum performance achievement.\n(2)\nReflects the impact of current expectations of achievement and stock price.\nAdditional information related to the Performance Awards and Stock Unit Awards was as follows for the periods presented:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions, except for per unit amounts)\nPerformance Awards\nWeighted-average grant date fair value per unit of awards granted\n$\n27.92\n \n$\n29.18\n \n$\n28.12\n \nTotal intrinsic value of awards received by participants\n51\n \n47\n \n13\n \nVested grant date fair value\n40\n \n37\n \n13\n \nStock Unit Awards\nWeighted-average grant date fair value per unit of awards granted\n$\n28.25\n \n$\n30.83\n \n$\n28.44\n \nTotal intrinsic value of awards received by participants\n33\n \n28\n \n14\n \nVested grant date fair value\n30\n \n23\n \n13\n \n \nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $\n39\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested performance and stock unit awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n1.7\n years.\n(b) Pension Benefits (CenterPoint Energy)\nCenterPoint Energy maintains a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering certain eligible employees, which is closed to new participants. CenterPoint Energy also maintains three additional qualified defined benefit pension plans, two of which are closed to new participants and one of which is frozen, that cover certain eligible employees and retirees of Vectren and are primarily non-contributory. In addition to the qualified defined benefit pension plans, CenterPoint Energy maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans which allow participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under CenterPoint Energy’s qualified pension plan except for federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. CenterPoint Energy also maintains a frozen non-qualified supplemental retirement plan covering certain former executives of Vectren.\nIn December 2022, the CenterPoint Energy Retirement Plan, a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, completed the 2022 Annuity Purchase to fund the annuities of certain retirees of the non-regulated business units of CenterPoint Energy (including previously divested businesses), as part of a de-risking strategy. The 2022 Annuity Purchase reduced the plan’s benefit obligation by $\n138\n million and plan assets by $\n136\n million, which were transferred to the annuity provider. The $\n138\n million transferred benefit obligation represented \n9.4\n% of CenterPoint Energy’s total benefit obligation as of its last remeasurement prior to the transaction. As a result of this transaction, CenterPoint Energy incurred a settlement charge of $\n47\n million. In addition, CenterPoint Energy was relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations and the annuity \n138\nprovider assumed the obligation to pay and administer the pension benefits for the \n1,119\n impacted retirees and beneficiaries, with no changes to the amount, timing or form of the benefit payments.\nCenterPoint Energy’s net periodic cost includes the following components relating to pension, including the non-qualified benefit plans, for the periods presented:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions)\nService cost (1)\n$\n25\n \n$\n25\n \n$\n29\n \nInterest cost (2)\n73\n \n76\n \n73\n \nExpected return on plan assets (2)\n(\n75\n)\n(\n76\n)\n(\n87\n)\nAmortization of net loss (2)\n28\n \n28\n \n31\n \nSettlement cost (2) (3)\n—\n \n—\n \n126\n \nNet periodic cost\n$\n51\n \n$\n53\n \n$\n172\n \n \n(1)\nIncluded in Operation and maintenance expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, net of amounts capitalized and regulatory deferrals.\n(2)\nIncluded in \nOther income (expense), net\n in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, net of regulatory deferrals.\n(3)\nA one-time, non-cash settlement cost is required when the total lump sum distributions or other settlements of plan benefit obligations during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic cost for that year. In 2023 and 2022, CenterPoint Energy recognized non-cash settlement cost due to lump sum settlement payments. The transfer of assets related to the 2022 Annuity Purchase is considered a lump sum settlement payment.\nCenterPoint Energy used the following assumptions to determine net periodic cost relating to pension benefits for the periods presented:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n4.95\n \n%\n5.15\n \n%\n2.80\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n6.50\n \n6.50\n \n5.00\n \nRate of increase in compensation levels\n4.97\n \n4.99\n \n4.95\n \nIn determining net periodic benefit cost, CenterPoint Energy uses fair value, as of the beginning of the year, as its basis for determining expected return on plan assets except for two of Vectren’s qualified defined benefit pension plans which use a market related value of assets.\n139\nThe following table summarizes changes in the benefit obligation, changes in plan assets, the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as well as the key actuarial assumptions of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans.

The Registrants’ employees (other than employees of Vectren and its subsidiaries) who were hired before January 1, 2018 and who have met certain age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plan, are eligible to participate in these benefits, provided, however, that life insurance benefits are available only for eligible retired employees who retired before January 1, 2022. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2018 are not eligible for these benefits, except that such employees represented by IBEW Local Union 66 are eligible to participate in certain of the benefits, subject to the applicable age and service requirements. With respect to retiree medical and prescription drug benefits, and, effective January 1, 2021, dental and vision benefits, employees represented by the IBEW Local Union 66 who retire on or after January 1, 2017, and their dependents, receive any such benefits exclusively through the NECA/IBEW Family Medical Care Plan pursuant to the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Houston Electric and CERC are required to fund a portion of their obligations in accordance with rate orders. All other obligations are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.\nCenterPoint Energy, through Vectren, also maintains a postretirement benefit plan that provides health care and life insurance benefits, which are a combination of self-insured and fully insured programs, to eligible Vectren retirees on both a contributory and non-contributory basis.\nPostretirement benefits are accrued over the active service period of employees.

Under the plan, participating employees may make pre-tax or Roth contributions and, if eligible, after-tax contributions up to certain federally mandated limits. Participating Registrants provide matching contributions and, as of January 1, 2020, for certain eligible employees, non-elective contributions up to certain limits. \nThe CenterPoint Energy Savings Plan has significant holdings of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2024, \n7,136,941\n shares of Common Stock were held by the savings plan, which represented approximately \n6\n% of its investments. Given the concentration of the investments in Common Stock, the savings plan and its participants have market risk related to this investment. The savings plan limits the percentage of future contributions that can be invested in Common Stock to \n25\n% and prohibits transfers of account balances where the transfer would result in more than \n25\n% of a participant’s total account balance invested in Common Stock.\nCenterPoint Energy allocates the savings plan benefit expense to Houston Electric and CERC related to their respective employees.

Benefit payments are made from the general assets of the participating Registrants or, in the case of certain plans, from a rabbi trust that is a grantor trust and remains subject to the claims of general creditors under applicable state and federal law. \nExpenses related to other benefit plans were recorded as follows for the periods presented:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\n \n(in millions)\nDeferred compensation plans\n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nAmounts related to other benefit plans were included in Benefit Obligations in the Registrants’ accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\n \n(in millions)\nDeferred compensation plans\n$\n22\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n1\n \nSplit-dollar life insurance arrangements \n46\n \n1\n \n—\n \n46\n \n1\n \n—\n \n(j) Change in Control Agreements and Other Employee Matters \nCenterPoint Energy has a change in control plan, which was amended and restated on May 1, 2017. The plan generally provides, to the extent applicable, in the case of the occurrence of both a change in control of CenterPoint Energy and a covered \n146\ntermination of employment, for severance benefits of up to \nthree\n times annual base salary plus bonus and other benefits. Certain CenterPoint Energy officers are participants under the plan.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Registrants’ employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements as follows:\nPercentage of Employees Covered\n \nAgreement Expiration\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nIBEW Local 66\nMay 2026\n17\n \n%\n53\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nOPEIU Local 12\nDecember 2025\n2\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n2\n \n%\nGas Workers Union Local 340\nApril 2025\n5\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n12\n \n%\nIBEW Locals 1393 and USW Locals 12213 & 7441\nDecember 2026\n3\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n8\n \n%\nIBEW Locals 949\nDecember 2025\n3\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n7\n \n%\nUSW Locals 13-227 \nJune 2027\n5\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n13\n \n%\nUSW Locals 13-1\nJune 2027\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n1\n \n%\nIBEW Local 702\nJune 2025\n3\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nTeamsters Local 135/215\nSeptember 2027\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nUWUA Local 175\nOctober 2027\n1\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n4\n \n%\nTotal\n39\n \n%\n53\n \n%\n47\n \n%\nThe collective bargaining agreements with Gas Workers Union Local 340, IBEW Local 949 and OPEIU Local 12 related to CERC employees in Minnesota, as well as with IBEW Local 702 related to SIGECO employees, are scheduled to expire in April 2025, December 2025, December 2025 and June 2025, respectively, and negotiations of these agreements are expected to be completed before the respective expirations.\n(9)  \nFair Value Measurements\n \nAssets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined below and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The types of assets carried at Level 1 fair value generally are exchange-traded derivatives and equity securities.\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Fair value assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are derivatives with fair values based on inputs from actively quoted markets. A market approach is utilized to value the Registrants’ Level 2 natural gas derivative assets or liabilities. CenterPoint Energy’s Level 2 indexed debt securities derivative is valued using an option model and a discounted cash flow model, which uses projected dividends on the ZENS-Related Securities and a discount rate as observable inputs.\nLevel 3: Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs reflect the Registrants’ judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability since limited market data exists. The Registrants develop these inputs based on the best information available, including the Registrants’ own data. \nThe Registrants determine the appropriate level for each financial asset and liability on a quarterly basis and recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Registrants did not have any assets or liabilities classified as Level 3. \nThe following tables present information about the Registrants’ assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Registrants to determine such fair value:\n147\nCenterPoint Energy\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\n(in millions)\nEquity securities \n$\n561\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n561\n \n$\n541\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n541\n \nInvestments, including money market funds (1)\n22\n \n—\n \n—\n \n22\n \n31\n \n—\n \n—\n \n31\n \nNatural gas derivatives (1)\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal assets\n$\n583\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n584\n \n$\n572\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n572\n \nLiabilities\n \n \n \n \nIndexed debt securities derivative\n$\n—\n \n$\n619\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n619\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n605\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n605\n \nNatural gas derivatives (2)\n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n12\n \n—\n \n12\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n—\n \n$\n622\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n622\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n617\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n617\n \nHouston Electric\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\n(in millions)\nInvestments, including money market funds (1)\n$\n5\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n14\n \nTotal assets\n$\n5\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n14\n \nCERC\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\n(in millions)\nInvestments, including money market funds (1)\n$\n15\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n15\n \nNatural gas derivatives  (1)\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal assets\n$\n15\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n15\n \nLiabilities\n \n \n \n \nNatural gas derivatives (2)\n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n11\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n11\n \n(1)\nIncluded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the respective Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n(2)\nIncluded in Other current liabilities in the respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nAs a result of classifying the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses as held for sale, CenterPoint Energy and CERC used a market approach consisting of contractual sales price adjusted for estimated working capital and other contractual purchase price adjustments to determine the fair value of the businesses classified as held for sale, which are Level 2 inputs. Neither CenterPoint Energy nor CERC recognized any gains or losses upon classification as held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 4 for further information.\nEstimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, investments in equity securities measured at fair value and short-term borrowings under AMAs are estimated to be approximately equivalent to carrying amounts and have been excluded from the table below. The carrying amounts of non-trading derivative assets and liabilities and CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS indexed debt securities derivative are stated at fair value and are excluded from the table below. The fair value of each debt instrument is determined by multiplying the principal amount of each debt instrument by a combination of historical trading prices and \n148\ncomparable issue data. These liabilities, which are not measured at fair value in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets, but for which the fair value is disclosed, would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nCenterPoint Energy (1)\nHouston Electric (1)\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy (1)\nHouston Electric (1)\nCERC\nLong-term debt, including current maturities\n(in millions)\nCarrying amount\n$\n20,961\n \n$\n8,822\n \n$\n5,184\n \n$\n18,609\n \n$\n7,587\n \n$\n4,670\n \nFair value\n19,597\n \n7,746\n \n5,032\n \n17,804\n \n6,917\n \n4,627\n \n(1)\nIncludes Securitization Bonds, as applicable.\n(10)   \nEquity Securities and Indexed Debt Securities (ZENS) (CenterPoint Energy)\n \n(a) Equity Securities\nGains and losses on equity securities, net of transaction costs, are recorded as Gain (loss) on equity securities in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.

Each ZENS is exchangeable at the holder’s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to \n95\n% of the market value of the reference shares attributable to such note. The number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS are adjusted for certain corporate events. \nCenterPoint Energy’s reference shares for each ZENS consisted of the following as of the dates presented:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in shares)\nAT&T Common\n0.7185\n \n0.7185\n \nCharter Common\n0.061382\n \n0.061382\n \nWBD Common\n0.173817\n \n0.173817\n \nCenterPoint Energy pays interest on the ZENS at an annual rate of \n2\n% plus the amount of any quarterly cash dividends paid in respect of the reference shares attributable to the ZENS. The principal amount of the ZENS is subject to increases or decreases to the extent that the annual yield from interest and cash dividends on the reference shares attributable to the ZENS  is less than or more than \n2.309\n%. The adjusted principal amount is defined in the ZENS instrument as “contingent principal.” As of December 31, 2024, the ZENS, having an original principal amount of $\n828\n million and a contingent principal amount of $\n9\n million, were outstanding and were exchangeable, at the option of the holders, for cash equal to \n95\n% of the market value of the reference shares attributable to the ZENS. As of December 31, 2024, the market value of such shares was approximately $\n558\n million, which would provide an exchange amount of $\n640\n for each $\n1,000\n original principal amount of ZENS. At maturity of the ZENS in 2029, CenterPoint Energy will be obligated to pay in cash the higher of the contingent principal amount of the ZENS or an amount based on the then-current market value of the reference shares, which will include any additional publicly-traded securities distributed with respect to the current reference shares prior to maturity. \nThe ZENS obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component (the holder’s option to receive the appreciated value of the reference shares at maturity). The bifurcated debt component accretes through interest charges annually up to the contingent principal amount of the ZENS in 2029. Such accretion will be reduced by annual cash interest payments, as previously described. The derivative component is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative component are recorded as Gain (loss) on indexed debt securities in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income. Changes in the fair value of the ZENS-Related Securities held by CenterPoint Energy are expected to substantially offset changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the ZENS.\n150\nThe following table provides summarized financial information related to CenterPoint Energy’s investment in ZENS-Related Securities and each component of CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS obligation for the periods presented: \n \nZENS-Related \nSecurities\nDebt\nComponent\nof ZENS\nDerivative\nComponent\nof ZENS\n(in millions)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021\n$\n820\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n903\n \nAccretion of debt component of ZENS\n—\n \n17\n \n—\n \n2% interest paid\n—\n \n(\n17\n)\n—\n \nDistribution to ZENS holders\n—\n \n(\n3\n)\n—\n \nGain on indexed debt securities\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n325\n)\nLoss on ZENS-Related Securities\n(\n313\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n507\n \n7\n \n578\n \nAccretion of debt component of ZENS\n—\n \n17\n \n—\n \n2% interest paid\n—\n \n(\n17\n)\n—\n \nDistribution to ZENS holders\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \nLoss on indexed debt securities\n—\n \n—\n \n27\n \nGain on ZENS-Related Securities\n31\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n538\n \n5\n \n605\n \nAccretion of debt component of ZENS\n—\n \n16\n \n—\n \n2% interest paid\n—\n \n(\n17\n)\n—\n \nDistribution to ZENS holders\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \nLoss on indexed debt securities\n—\n \n—\n \n14\n \nGain on ZENS-Related Securities\n20\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n558\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n619\n \n(11)   \nEquity (CenterPoint Energy)\n \nDividends Declared and Paid (CenterPoint Energy)\nCenterPoint Energy’s dividends declared and dividends paid during 2024, 2023 and 2022 are presented below:\nDividends Declared Per Share\nDividends Paid Per Share\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCommon Stock\n$\n0.830\n \n$\n0.780\n \n$\n0.720\n \n$\n0.810\n \n$\n0.770\n \n$\n0.700\n \nSeries A Preferred Stock (1)\n$\n—\n \n$\n30.625\n \n$\n61.250\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n61.250\n \n$\n61.250\n \n(1)\nAll of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were redeemed during 2023 as further described below.\nCommon Stock (CenterPoint Energy)\n(a) Underwritten Offering\nOn August 9, 2024, CenterPoint Energy issued \n9,754,194\n shares of Common Stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of $\n25.36\n per share, for net proceeds of $\n247\n million after deducting issuance costs.

On or after May 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading \n156\nday immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the Convertible Notes may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at any time at the conversion rate then in effect, irrespective of the conditions. CenterPoint Energy may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date and no sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes.\nUpon conversion of the Convertible Notes, CenterPoint Energy will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at CenterPoint Energy’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of CenterPoint Energy’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is initially \n27.1278\n shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $\n36.86\n per share of Common Stock). The initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes represents a premium of approximately \n25.0\n% over the last reported sale price of the Common Stock on the NYSE on August 1, 2023. Initially, a maximum of \n33,909,700\n shares of Common Stock may be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes based on the initial maximum conversion rate of \n33.9097\n shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events (as described in the Convertible Notes Indenture) but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.\nIn addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, CenterPoint Energy will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder of Convertible Notes  who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event. If CenterPoint Energy undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture), holders of the Convertible Notes may require CenterPoint Energy to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of CenterPoint Energy and rank senior in right of payment to any of CenterPoint Energy’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to any of CenterPoint Energy’s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of CenterPoint Energy’s secured indebtedness it may incur in the future to the extent of the value of the assets securing such future secured indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables but excluding intercompany obligations and liabilities of a type not required to be reflected on a balance sheet of such subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries.\nDebt Repayments and Redemptions. \nDuring 2024, the following debt instruments were repaid at maturity or redeemed prior to maturity:\nRegistrant\nRepayment/Redemption Date\nDebt Instrument\nAggregate Principal\nInterest Rate\nMaturity Date\n(in millions)\nCenterPoint Energy\n \n(1)\nMarch 2024\nFirst Mortgage Bonds\n$\n22\n \n3.50\n%\n2024\nCenterPoint Energy\n \n(2)\nMay 2024\nSenior Notes\n350\n \nSOFR + \n0.65\n%\n2024\nCenterPoint Energy (3)\nSeptember 2024\nSenior Notes\n500\n \n2.50\n%\n2024\nTotal CenterPoint Energy\n$\n872\n \n(1)  On February 6, 2024, SIGECO provided notice of redemption and on March 1, 2024, SIGECO paid down the outstanding principal of $\n22\n million aggregate principal amount of SIGECO’s outstanding first mortgage bonds due 2024 at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the first mortgage bonds to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n(2)    On May 13, 2024, CenterPoint Energy redeemed $\n350\n million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding floating rate senior notes due 2024 at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\n(3)  In September 2024, CenterPoint Energy redeemed $\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding \n2.50\n% senior notes due 2024 at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\n157\nCenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric recorded the following losses on early extinguishment of debt, including make-whole premiums and recognition of deferred debt related costs, in Interest expense and other finance charges on their respective Statements of Consolidated Income unless specified otherwise:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nCenterPoint Energy (1)\n$\n—\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n47\n \nHouston Electric (2)\n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n(1)  The loss on early extinguishment of debt at CenterPoint Energy during 2023 was recorded as a regulatory asset.\n(2)  The loss on early extinguishment of debt at Houston Electric during 2022 was recorded as a regulatory asset.\nSecuritization Bonds. \nAs of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and SIGECO had special purpose subsidiaries including the Bond Companies and the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary, which are consolidated. The consolidated special purpose subsidiaries are wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote entities that were formed solely for the purpose of securitizing transition property or facilitating the securitization financing of qualified costs in the second quarter of 2023 associated with the completed retirement of SIGECO’s A.B. Brown coal generation facilities through the issuance of securitization bonds and activities incidental thereto. The Securitization Bonds issued by Bond Company IV are payable only through the imposition and collection of transition charges, as defined in the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act, which are irrevocable, non-bypassable charges to provide recovery of authorized qualified costs. The SIGECO Securitization Bonds are payable only through the imposition of securitization charges payable by SIGECO’s retail electric customers, which are non-bypassable charges to provide recovery of the qualified costs of SIGECO authorized by the IURC order. CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and SIGECO have no payment obligations in respect of the Securitization Bonds issued by Bond Company IV or the SIGECO Securitization Bonds other than to remit the applicable transition or securitization charges they collect as set forth in servicing agreements among Houston Electric, the Bond Companies, SIGECO, the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary and other parties. Each special purpose entity is the sole owner of the right to impose, collect and receive the applicable transition and securitization charges securing the bonds issued by that entity. Creditors of CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and SIGECO have no recourse to any assets or revenues of the Bond Companies (including the transition charges) or the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary, as applicable, and the bondholders have no recourse to the to the general credit of CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric or SIGECO.\nCredit Facilities. \nThe Registrants had the following revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2024:\nRegistrant\nExecution\n Date \nSize of\nFacility\nDraw Rate of SOFR plus (1)\nFinancial Covenant Limit on Debt for Borrowed Money to Capital Ratio \n \nDebt for Borrowed Money to Capital \nRatio as of December 31, 2024 (2)\nTermination\n Date (5)\n(in millions)\nCenterPoint Energy\nDecember 6, 2022\n$\n2,400\n \n1.500\n%\n65\n%\n(3)\n59.3\n%\nDecember 6, 2027\nCenterPoint Energy (4)\nDecember 6, 2022\n250\n \n1.125\n%\n65\n%\n44.8\n%\nDecember 6, 2027\nHouston Electric\nDecember 6, 2022\n300\n \n1.250\n%\n67.5\n%\n(3)\n53.3\n%\nDecember 6, 2027\nCERC\nDecember 6, 2022\n1,050\n \n1.125\n%\n65\n%\n41.4\n%\nDecember 6, 2027\nTotal\n$\n4,000\n \n(1)\nBased on credit ratings as of December 31, 2024.\n(2)\nAs defined in the revolving credit facility agreement, excluding Securitization Bonds.\n(3)\nFor CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric, the financial covenant limit will temporarily increase to \n70\n% if Houston Electric experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and CenterPoint Energy certifies to the administrative agent that Houston Electric has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed $\n100\n million in a consecutive \n12\n-month period, all or part of which Houston Electric intends to seek to recover through securitization financing.

The general mortgage bonds that are held in trust to secure pollution control bonds are not reflected in Houston Electric’s consolidated financial statements because of the contingent nature of the obligations. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, \n70\n% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $\n4.7\n billion of additional general mortgage bonds could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and \n70\n% of property additions. No first mortgage bonds are outstanding under the M&DOT, and Houston Electric is contractually obligated to not issue any additional first mortgage bonds under the M&DOT and is undertaking actions to release the lien of the M&DOT and terminate the M&DOT.\nAs of December 31, 2024, SIGECO had approximately $\n985\n million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding.

For tax years 2023 and 2024, the Registrants are participants in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process.\n \n(14)   \nCommitments and Contingencies\n \n(a) Purchase Obligations (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)\nCommitments include minimum purchase obligations related to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas reportable segment and CenterPoint Energy’s Electric reportable segment. Contracts with minimum payment obligations have various quantity requirements and durations and are not classified as non-trading derivative assets and liabilities in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 because these contracts meet an exception as “normal purchases contracts” or do not meet the definition of a derivative. Natural gas and coal supply commitments also include transportation contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative. \nOn February 1, 2023, Indiana Electric entered into an amended and restated BTA to purchase the \n191\n MW Posey Solar project for a fixed purchase price over the anticipated \n35-year\n life. On February 7, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a CPCN with the IURC to approve the amended BTA. With the passage of the IRA, Indiana Electric can now pursue PTCs for solar projects. Indiana Electric filed the updated CPCN with a request that project costs, net of PTCs, be recovered in rate base, through base rates or the CECA mechanism, depending on which provides more timely recovery. On September 6, 2023, the IURC issued an order approving the CPCN.  The Posey Solar project is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2025. See Note 20 for additional details.\nOn January 11, 2023, the IURC issued an order approving the settlement agreement granting Indiana Electric a CPCN to purchase and acquire the \n130\n MW Pike County solar project through a BTA and approved the estimated cost. The IURC also \n164\ndesignated the project as a clean energy project as well as approved the proposed levelized rate and associated ratemaking and accounting treatment. Due to inflationary pressures, the developer disclosed that costs exceeded the agreed upon levels in the BTA. After negotiations, Indiana Electric and the developer were not able to agree upon updated pricing. As a result, on March 15, 2024, Indiana Electric provided notice to the IURC that it was exercising its right to terminate the BTA, which terminated all further obligations of Indiana Electric with respect to the project.\nAs of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy and CERC had the following undiscounted minimum purchase obligations: \nCenterPoint Energy\nCERC\nNatural Gas Supply \nElectric Supply (1)\nOther (2)\nNatural Gas Supply\n(in millions)\n2025\n$\n635\n \n$\n83\n \n$\n95\n \n$\n631\n \n2026\n601\n \n130\n \n100\n \n597\n \n2027\n517\n \n135\n \n18\n \n513\n \n2028\n473\n \n97\n \n8\n \n470\n \n2029\n459\n \n94\n \n2\n \n456\n \nThereafter\n1,566\n \n1,303\n \n190\n \n1,544\n \nTotal\n$\n4,251\n \n$\n1,842\n \n$\n413\n \n$\n4,211\n \n(1)\nRelated to PPAs with commitments ranging from \n15\n years to \n25\n years.\n(2)\nRelated primarily to technology hardware and software agreements.\nExcluded from the table above are estimates for cash outlays from other PPAs through Indiana Electric that do not have minimum thresholds but require payment when energy is generated by the provider. Costs arising from certain of these commitments are pass-through costs, generally collected dollar-for-dollar from retail customers through regulator-approved cost recovery mechanisms.\n(b) AMAs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)\nCenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas businesses continue to utilize AMAs associated with their utility distribution service in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas. The AMAs have varying terms, the longest of which expires in 2029. Pursuant to the provisions of the agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas either sells natural gas to the asset manager and agrees to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas throughout the year at the same cost, or simply purchases its full natural gas requirements at each delivery point from the asset manager. Generally, AMAs are contracts between CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets. In these agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage, supply and delivery arrangements for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas may receive compensation from the asset manager through payments made over the life of the AMAs. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas has an obligation to purchase their winter storage requirements that have been released to the asset manager under these AMAs. For amounts outstanding under these AMAs, see Note 12.\n(c) Guarantees (CenterPoint Energy)\nCenterPoint Energy recognizes guarantee obligations at fair value. CenterPoint Energy discloses parent company guarantees of a subsidiary’s obligation when that guarantee results in the exposure of a material obligation of the parent company even if the probability of fulfilling such obligation is considered remote.\nOn May 21, 2023, CenterPoint Energy, through Vectren Energy Services, entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell Energy Systems Group. The sale closed on June 30, 2023. See Note 4 for further information. \nIn the normal course of business prior to the consummation of the transaction on June 30, 2023, CenterPoint Energy, primarily through Vectren, issued parent company level guarantees supporting \nEnergy Systems Group\n’s obligations. When Energy Systems Group was wholly-owned by CenterPoint Energy, these guarantees did not represent incremental consolidated obligations, but rather, these guarantees represented guarantees of Energy Systems Group’s obligations to allow it to conduct business without posting other forms of assurance. For those obligations where potential exposure can be estimated, management estimates the maximum exposure under these guarantees to be approximately $\n465\n million as of December 31, 2024 and expects the exposure to decrease pro rata. This exposure primarily relates to energy savings guarantees on federal \n165\nenergy savings performance contracts. Other parent company level guarantees, certain of which do not contain a cap on potential liability, were issued prior to the sale of Energy Systems Group in support of federal operations and maintenance projects for which a maximum exposure cannot be estimated based on the nature of the projects. \nUnder the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, ESG Holdings Group must generally use reasonable best efforts to replace existing CenterPoint Energy guarantees with credit support provided by a party other than CenterPoint Energy as of and after the closing of the transaction. The Equity Purchase Agreement also requires certain protections to be provided for any damages incurred by CenterPoint Energy in relation to these guarantees not released by closing. \nNo\n additional guarantees were provided by CenterPoint Energy in favor of Energy Systems Group subsequent to the closing of the sale on June 30, 2023.\nWhile there can be no assurance that performance under any of these parent company guarantees will not be required in the future, CenterPoint Energy considers the likelihood of a material amount being incurred to be remote. CenterPoint Energy believes that, from \nEnergy Systems Group\n’s inception in 1994 to the closing of the sale of Energy Systems Group on June 30, 2023, \nEnergy Systems Group\n had a history of generally meeting its performance obligations and energy savings guarantees and its installed products operated effectively. CenterPoint Energy recorded no amounts on its Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 related to its obligation under the outstanding guarantees.\n(d) Legal, Environmental and Other Matters\nLegal Matters\nLitigation Related to Hurricane Beryl.\n Various federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities, such as the Texas Governor’s office, the Texas legislature and the PUCT, have called for or are conducting inquiries and investigations into Hurricane Beryl, the efforts made by Houston Electric to prepare for, and respond to, this event, including the electric service outage issues, and the procurement of TEEEF. Moreover, additional governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities may conduct such inquiries and investigations, as well. There are significant uncertainties around these inquiries and investigations and potential results and consequences, including with respect to our recovery of costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Beryl and whether any financial penalties will be assessed or changes to Houston Electric’s system, service territories, operations and/or regulatory treatment will result therefrom. Further, on January 22, 2025, a putative shareholder of CenterPoint Energy, Donel Davidson, filed a derivative petition in Harris County District Court, Texas, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment on behalf of CenterPoint Energy against certain of its current and former directors and officers citing, in part, the topics of these inquiries and investigations. The action seeks to recover damages and other relief from the defendants on behalf of CenterPoint Energy. Additionally, on February 12, 2025, a second putative shareholder of CenterPoint Energy made a demand on the Board to investigate the same basic allegations raised in the derivative petition filed by Donel Davidson.\nCenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric are subject to current and potential future litigation and claims arising out of Hurricane Beryl, which litigation and claims could include allegations of, among other things, personal injury, property damage, various economic losses in connection with loss of power, unlawful business practices, and others. As of December 31, 2024, \nthree\n putative class actions had been filed against CenterPoint Energy and/or Houston Electric in the District Courts of Harris County, Texas, on behalf of individuals or entities who claim losses due to power outages lasting at least 48 hours as a result of Hurricane Beryl, such actions consisting of the following proposed classes: (1) all restaurants in Harris County, Galveston County, and Montgomery County; (2) all residential customers; and (3) all health, wellness, medical and beauty facilities in Harris County. These putative classes assert claims and theories of negligence, gross negligence, nuisance, fraud, and/or violation of Houston Electric’s tariff for retail delivery service, and each seeks damages in excess of $\n100\n million for, among other things, business interruption, property damage and loss, cost of repair, loss of use and market value, lost income, nuisance, extreme mental anguish and/or punitive damages. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, two individual actions had been filed in Harris County District Courts asserting claims of negligence, negligence per se and/or gross negligence against CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric. The plaintiffs in these actions allege personal injury and/or property damage from downed power lines and seek damages in excess of $\n1\n million. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric intend to vigorously defend themselves against the lawsuits. CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries have general and excess liability insurance policies that provide coverage for third party bodily injury and property damage claims. Given the nature of some allegations, it is possible that the insurers could dispute coverage for some types of claims or damages that may be alleged by plaintiffs, and CenterPoint Energy has received from two insurers denials of indemnity coverage in the putative class actions based on the failure to supply exclusion. Those insurers have also reserved their rights with respect to coverage in those actions. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric intend to continue to pursue all available insurance coverage for all of these matters. To date, there have not been demands, quantification, disclosure or discovery of damages by any party to any of the above legal matters that are sufficient to enable CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries to estimate exposure. Given that, as well as the preliminary nature of the proceedings, the numerosity of parties and complexity of issues involved, and the uncertainties of \n166\nlitigation, CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the outcome or consequences of any of the foregoing matters or to estimate a range of potential losses. For more information regarding Hurricane Beryl, see Note 7.\nLitigation Related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event.\n Various legal proceedings are still pending against numerous entities with respect to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, including against CenterPoint Energy, Utility Holding, Houston Electric, and CERC. Like other Texas energy companies and TDUs, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric have become involved in certain investigations, litigation and other regulatory and legal proceedings regarding their efforts to restore power during the storm and their compliance with NERC, ERCOT and PUCT rules and directives. Additionally, like other natural gas market participants, CERC has been named in litigation alleging gas market manipulation.\nCenterPoint Energy, Utility Holding, and Houston Electric, along with hundreds of other defendants (including ERCOT, power generation companies, other TDUs, natural gas producers, REPs, and other entities) received claims and lawsuits filed by plaintiffs alleging wrongful death, personal injury, property damage and other injuries and damages. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately \n220\n pending lawsuits that are consolidated in Texas state court in Harris County, Texas, as part of the MDL proceeding related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, and CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric, along with numerous other entities, have been named as defendants in approximately \n155\n of those lawsuits. \nOne\n of the lawsuits in the MDL is a putative class action on behalf of everyone who received electric power via the ERCOT grid and sustained a power outage between February 10, 2021 and February 28, 2021. Additionally, Utility Holding is currently named as a defendant in \none\n lawsuit in which CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric are also named as defendants. \nThe judge overseeing the MDL issued an initial case management order and stayed all proceedings and discovery. Per the case management order, the judge entertained dispositive motions in \nfive\n representative or “bellwether” cases and, in late January 2023, issued rulings on them. The judge ruled that ERCOT has sovereign immunity as a governmental entity and dismissed the suits against it. In a subsequent opinion in an unrelated matter, the Texas Supreme Court held that ERCOT is entitled to sovereign immunity. This ruling will apply to claims against ERCOT in the MDL. The MDL judge also dismissed all claims against the natural gas defendants (which list of natural gas defendants incorrectly included Utility Holding) and the REP defendants and some causes of action against the other defendants. CenterPoint Energy expects that the claims against Utility Holding will ultimately be dismissed in light of the judge’s initial rulings. As to the TDU and generator defendants, the judge dismissed some causes of action but denied the motions to dismiss claims for negligence, gross negligence, and nuisance, which denial the TDU defendants and generator defendants asked the courts of appeals to overturn. On April 2, 2024, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourteenth District of Texas issued an opinion in the TDU mandamus proceeding, granting in part and denying in part the TDUs’ mandamus request. In its opinion, the panel granted the TDUs’ mandamus request relating to the TDUs’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims for (1) negligence, (2) negligent nuisance and (3) strict liability nuisance and ordered those claims be dismissed. The panel denied the TDUs’ mandamus request relating to the TDUs’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ gross negligence and intentional nuisance claims. On May 22, 2024, the TDUs filed a mandamus petition with the Supreme Court of Texas, seeking dismissal of the remaining claims. The Supreme Court of Texas subsequently asked for briefing on the merits and, on December 20, 2024, set the TDUs’ mandamus petition for oral argument, which occurred on February 19, 2025. \nIn the generator mandamus proceeding that was pending in the Court of Appeals for the First District of Texas, a three-judge panel granted the generators’ mandamus request and ordered dismissal of all claims asserted against the generators’ defendants. The plaintiffs asked the entire First Court of Appeals to rehear the panel’s decision. On November 26, 2024, the First Court of Appeals denied that motion. The plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandamus with the Supreme Court of Texas on January 31, 2025.\nThe MDL judge allowed defendants (including Houston Electric) to file several additional motions on preliminary legal issues. These motions included the TDUs’ motion to dismiss under Chapter 150 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which was filed in one of the bellwether cases and argued that all of plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not include a sufficient certificate by a qualified engineer with their petition, as required by Texas law, as well as a motion to deny class certification in the putative class action. On November 13, 2024, the MDL Court granted the TDUs’ motion to dismiss under Chapter 150, and on December 3, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of that ruling. On January 8, 2025, the MDL Court denied class certification in the putative class action. Following issuance of the order denying class certification, a new lawsuit was filed on behalf of approximately 140 plaintiffs in Harris County District Court against hundreds of defendants, including CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric. In addition, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the denial of class certification on January 27, 2025. Aside from addressing certain additional preliminary legal issues, the cases remain stayed in the MDL Court. CenterPoint Energy, Utility Holding, and Houston Electric intend to vigorously defend themselves against the claims raised.\n167\nCenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric have also responded to inquiries from the Texas Attorney General and the Galveston County District Attorney’s Office, and various other regulatory and governmental entities also conducted inquiries, investigations and other reviews of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and the efforts made by various entities to prepare for, and respond to, the event, including the electric generation shortfall issues.\nIn February 2023, \ntwelve\n lawsuits were filed in state district court in Harris County and Tom Green County, Texas, against dozens of gas market participants in Texas, including natural gas producers, processors, pipelines, marketers, sellers, traders, gas utilities, and financial institutions. Plaintiffs named CERC as a defendant, along with “CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc.,” incorrectly identifying it as CERC’s parent company (CenterPoint Energy previously divested CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc.). \nOne\n lawsuit filed in Harris County is a putative class action on behalf of \ntwo\n classes of electric and natural gas customers (those who experienced a loss of electricity and/or natural gas, and those who were charged securitization-related surcharges on a utility bill or were otherwise charged higher rates for electricity and/or gas during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event), potentially including millions of class members. \nTwo\n other lawsuits (\none\n filed in Harris County and \none\n in Tom Green County) were brought by an entity that purports to be an assignee of the claims of tens of thousands of persons and entities. These, and \nnine\n other similar lawsuits filed in Harris County, generally allege that the defendants engaged in gas market manipulation and price gouging, including by intentionally withholding, suppressing, or diverting supplies of natural gas in connection with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, Winter Storm Elliott, and other severe weather conditions, and through financial market manipulation. Plaintiffs allege that this manipulation impacted gas supply and prices as well as the market, supply, and price of electricity in Texas and caused blackouts and other damage. Plaintiffs assert claims for tortious interference with existing contract, private nuisance, and unjust enrichment, and allege a broad array of injuries and damages, including personal injury, property damage, and harm from certain costs being securitized and passed on to ratepayers. The lawsuits do not specify the amount of damages sought, but seek broad categories of actual, compensatory, statutory, consequential economic, and punitive damages; restitution and disgorgement; pre- and post-judgment interest; costs and attorneys’ fees; and other relief. All twelve lawsuits have been tagged for transfer to the existing MDL proceeding referenced above, but only three of the cases have been served against the defendants, including CERC. These gas market cases are in addition to the \n220\n cases noted above regarding electric market issues.\nOn February 2, 2024, CERC filed pleas to the jurisdiction in the \nthree\n cases in which it was served; CERC also partially joined the other defendants’ motions to dismiss and additional pleas to the jurisdiction. On April 2, 2024, plaintiffs in the \nthree\n served cases filed amended petitions rather than responding to pleas to the jurisdiction and motions to dismiss. Among other changes, plaintiffs in these \nthree\n cases dismissed CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc., but maintained the same \nthree\n causes of action as to the remaining defendants. CERC has vigorously defended itself against the claims raised, including filing updated pleas to the jurisdiction on May 17, 2024 in response to plaintiffs’ amended petitions – and will continue to do so. On August 12, 2024, plaintiffs in the putative class action filed a motion for leave to amend to add additional plaintiffs/class representatives. Defendants opposed this motion on September 20, 2024. On September 23, 2024, the MDL judge heard oral argument on CERC’s plea to the jurisdiction and defendants’ motions to dismiss and other pleas to the jurisdiction. On November 7, 2024 and November 11, 2024, the MDL judge granted defendants’ motion to dismiss and CERC’s plea to the jurisdiction in all three cases.  As a result of these rulings, all claims against CERC were dismissed with prejudice.  Plaintiffs have appealed these rulings, and the appeals have been assigned to the Court of Appeals for the First District of Texas. On December 4, 2024, the MDL judge denied as moot plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend to add additional plaintiffs/class representatives in the putative class action case.  On January 17, 2025, the plaintiffs in the putative class action case filed an unopposed motion to dismiss their appeal, which the Court of Appeals granted on February 4, 2025, dismissing the appeal. Plaintiffs’ opening briefs in the remaining \ntwo\n cases are scheduled to be filed on March 28, 2025. \nTo date, there have not been demands, quantification, disclosure or discovery of damages by any party to any of the above legal matters that are sufficient to enable CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries to estimate exposure. Given that, as well as the preliminary nature of the proceedings, the numerosity of parties and complexity of issues involved, and the uncertainties of litigation, CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the outcome or consequences of any of the foregoing matters or to estimate a range of potential losses. CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries have general and excess liability insurance policies that provide coverage for third party bodily injury and property damage claims. As CenterPoint Energy previously noted, given the nature of certain of the plaintiffs’ allegations, insurance coverage may not be available other than for third party bodily injury and property damage claims caused by an accident, and \none\n of CenterPoint Energy’s insurers has reserved its rights with respect to coverage for plaintiffs’ intentional nuisance claims as well as plaintiffs’ claims in the gas market cases. CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries intend to continue to pursue all available insurance coverage for all of these matters.\n168\nJefferson Parish\n. Several parishes and the State of Louisiana filed \n42\n suits under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act against hundreds of oil and gas companies seeking compensatory damages for contamination and erosion of the Louisiana coastline allegedly caused by historical oil and gas operations. \nOne\n of the defendants in \none\n of the lawsuits (filed in 2013 only by the Parish of Jefferson) is Primary Fuels, Inc., a predecessor company of CenterPoint Energy, which operated in Louisiana from 1983 to 1989. All \n42\n suits were removed to Louisiana federal courts twice and were stayed for several years pending the district courts’ consideration of various motions to remand and multiple appeals of remand orders. Recently, several cases involving other parishes that had been remanded to Louisiana state court have begun to resume proceedings in state court. However, as of December 31, 2024, the federal district court had not ruled on Jefferson Parish’s motion to remand to state court the lawsuit which includes Primary Fuels among the defendants.\nBecause of the procedurally preliminary nature of the proceedings, lack of information about both the scope of and damages for Jefferson Parish’s claim against Primary Fuels, Inc., the numerosity of parties and complexity of issues involved, and the uncertainties of litigation, CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the outcome or consequences of this matter or to estimate a range of potential losses. CenterPoint Energy will continue to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised and pursue any and all available insurance coverage.\nEnvironmental Matters\nMGP Sites.\n CenterPoint Energy, CERC and their predecessors, including predecessors of Vectren, operated MGPs in the past. The costs CenterPoint Energy or CERC, as applicable, expect to incur to fulfill their respective obligations are estimated by management using assumptions based on actual costs incurred, the timing of expected future payments and inflation factors, among others. While CenterPoint Energy and CERC have recorded obligations for all costs which are probable and estimable, including amounts they are presently obligated to incur in connection with activities at these sites, it is possible that future events may require remedial activities which are not presently foreseen, and those costs may not be subject to PRP or insurance recovery. \n(i)\nMinnesota MGPs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)\n. With respect to certain Minnesota MGP sites, CenterPoint Energy and CERC have completed state-ordered remediation and continue state-ordered monitoring and water treatment. CenterPoint Energy and CERC recorded a liability as reflected in the table below for continued monitoring and any future remediation required by regulators in Minnesota. \n(ii)\nIndiana MGPs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)\n. In the Indiana Gas service territory, the existence, location and certain general characteristics of \n26\n gas manufacturing and storage sites have been identified for which CenterPoint Energy and CERC may have some remedial responsibility. A remedial investigation/feasibility study was completed at \none\n of the sites under an agreed upon order between Indiana Gas and the IDEM, and a Record of Decision was issued by the IDEM in January 2000. The remaining sites have been submitted to the IDEM’s VRP. CenterPoint Energy has also identified its involvement in \nfive\n manufactured gas plant sites in SIGECO’s service territory, all of which are currently enrolled in the IDEM’s VRP. CenterPoint Energy is currently conducting some level of remedial activities, including groundwater monitoring at certain sites.\n(iii)\nOther MGPs\n \n(CenterPoint Energy and CERC).\n In addition to the Minnesota and Indiana sites, the EPA and other regulators have investigated MGP sites that were owned or operated by CenterPoint Energy or CERC or may have been owned by one of their former affiliates.\nTotal costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time. The estimated accrued costs are limited to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s share of the remediation efforts and are therefore net of exposures of other PRPs. The estimated range of possible remediation costs for the sites for which CenterPoint Energy and CERC believe they may have responsibility was based on remediation continuing for the minimum time frame given in the table below:\nDecember 31, 2024\nCenterPoint Energy\nCERC\n(in millions, except years)\nAmount accrued for remediation\n$\n13\n \n$\n11\n \nMinimum estimated remediation costs\n8\n \n7\n \nMaximum estimated remediation costs\n47\n \n40\n \nMinimum years of remediation\n5\n5\nMaximum years of remediation\n50\n50\n169\nThe cost estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average costs for remediation of sites of similar size. The actual remediation costs will depend on the number of sites to be remediated, the participation of other PRPs, if any, and the remediation methods used. \nCenterPoint Energy and CERC do not expect the ultimate outcome of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of either CenterPoint Energy or CERC.\nAsbestos.\n \nSome facilities owned by the Registrants or their predecessors contain or have contained asbestos insulation and other asbestos-containing materials. The Registrants are from time to time named, along with numerous others, as defendants in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos, and the Registrants anticipate that additional claims may be asserted in the future. Although their ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time, the Registrants do not expect these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCCR Rule (CenterPoint Energy). \nIn April 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates ash as non-hazardous material under the RCRA. The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash, and a portion of the ash generated by Indiana Electric’s generating plants will continue to be reused. \nIndiana Electric has \nthree\n ash ponds, \ntwo\n at the F.B. Culley facility (Culley East and Culley West) and \none\n at the A.B. Brown facility. Under the CCR Rule, Indiana Electric is required to perform integrity assessments, including ground water monitoring, at its F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown generating stations. Pursuant to the CCR Rule, both the Culley East and A.B. Brown facilities were taken out of service in a timely manner per the commitments made to the EPA in the extension requests filed for both ponds. On April 24, 2019, Indiana Electric received an order from the IURC approving recovery in rates of costs associated with the closure of the Culley West pond, which has already completed closure activities. On August 14, 2019, Indiana Electric filed its petition with the IURC for recovery of costs associated with the closure of the A.B. Brown ash pond, which would include costs associated with the excavation and recycling of ponded ash. This petition was subsequently approved by the IURC on May 13, 2020. On October 28, 2020, the IURC approved Indiana Electric’s ECA proceeding, which included the initiation of recovery of the federally mandated project costs.\nOn November 1, 2022, Indiana Electric filed for a CPCN to recover federally mandated costs associated with closure of the Culley East Pond, its third and final ash pond. Indiana Electric sought accounting and ratemaking relief for the project, and on June 8, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a revised CPCN for recovery of the federally mandated ash pond costs. On February 7, 2024 the IURC approved the federally mandated costs, both incurred and projected, of $\n52\n million in capital costs, plus an estimated $\n133,000\n in annual operation and maintenance expenses, for recovery through the ECA.\nAs of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy had recorded an approximate $\n121\n million ARO, which represents the discounted value of future cash flow estimates to close the ponds at A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley. This estimate is subject to change due to the contractual arrangements; continued assessments of the ash, closure methods, and the timing of closure; implications of Indiana Electric’s generation transition plan; changing environmental regulations; and proceeds received from the settlements in a previously settled insurance proceeding. In addition to these AROs, Indiana Electric also anticipates equipment purchases of between $\n60\n million and $\n80\n million to complete the A.B. Brown closure project.\nOn April 25, 2024, the EPA released its final Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System; Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities; Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments rule (CCR Legacy Rule), which was published in the federal register in May 2024. The CCR Legacy Rule requires companies to investigate previously closed impoundments that were used historically for ash disposal or locations which have had ash placed on them in amounts set forth in the CCR Legacy Rule. The Registrants have completed their preliminary review of potential sites that will require further investigation under the CCR Legacy Rule and identified certain sites in Indiana for further evaluation. During 2024, Indiana Electric recorded an approximate $\n11\n million ARO with a corresponding increase of $\n11\n million to Property, plant and equipment for amounts recoverable for electric generation stations that are currently in service. These estimates reflect the discounted value of future estimated capping costs for an area of historic ash placement at F.B. Culley. Indiana Electric will continue to refine the assumptions, engineering analyses and resulting cost estimates associated with this ARO and such refinement could materially impact the amount of the estimated ARO.\nClean Water Act Permitting of Groundwater and Power Plant Discharges\n. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion providing that indirect discharges via groundwater or other non-point sources are subject to permitting and liability under the Clean Water Act when they are the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. On November 27, 2023, the EPA published draft guidance regarding the application of the “functional equivalent” analysis as related to permitting of certain \n170\ndischarges through groundwater to surface waters. The Registrants do not currently anticipate impacts from this guidance, but groundwater monitoring continues under the CCR Rule.\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized revisions to the existing steam electric wastewater discharge standards which set more stringent wastewater discharge limits and effectively prohibited further wet disposal of coal ash in ash ponds. In February 2019, the IURC approved Indiana Electric’s Effluent Limitation Guidelines Compliance Plan for its F.B. Culley Generating Station, which was completed in compliance with the requirements of the Effluent Limitation Guidelines. On April 25, 2024, the EPA released its final Supplemental Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Generating Point Source Category. The Registrants currently anticipate that they will be in compliance with the Supplemental ELG Guidelines at the Culley facility due to previous wastewater treatment upgrades.\nOther Environmental. \nFrom time to time, the Registrants identify the presence of environmental contaminants during operations or on property where their predecessors have conducted operations. Other such sites involving contaminants may be identified in the future. The Registrants have and expect to continue to remediate any identified sites consistent with state and federal legal obligations. From time to time, the Registrants have received notices, and may receive notices in the future, from regulatory authorities or others regarding status as a PRP in connection with sites found to require remediation due to the presence of environmental contaminants. In addition, the Registrants have been, or may be, named from time to time as defendants in litigation related to such sites. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted at this time, the Registrants do not expect these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOther Proceedings\nThe Registrants are involved in other legal, environmental, tax and regulatory proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions and governmental agencies regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, the Registrants are also defendants in legal proceedings with respect to claims brought by various plaintiffs against broad groups of participants in the energy industry. Some of these proceedings involve substantial amounts. The Registrants regularly analyze current information and, as necessary, provide accruals for probable and reasonably estimable liabilities on the eventual disposition of these matters. The Registrants do not expect the disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n(15)  \nEarnings Per Share (CenterPoint Energy)\n \nBasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Participating securities are excluded from weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the computation of basic earnings per common share. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including all potentially dilutive common shares, if the effect of such common shares is dilutive.\nDiluted earnings per common share reflects the dilutive effect of potential common shares from share-based awards. The dilutive effect of restricted stock is computed using the if-converted method, which assumes conversion of the restricted stock at the beginning of the period. The dilutive effect of restricted stock is computed using the treasury stock method, as applicable, which includes the incremental shares that would be hypothetically vested in excess of the number of shares assumed to be hypothetically repurchased with the assumed proceeds.\nDiluted earnings per common share will also reflect the dilutive effect of potential common shares from the conversion of the Convertible Notes. Convertible debt in which the principal amount must be settled in cash is excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. There would be no interest expense adjustment to the numerator for the cash-settled portion of the Convertible Notes because that portion will always be settled in cash. The conversion spread value in shares will be included in diluted earnings per common share using the if-converted method if the convertible debt is in the money. The denominator of diluted earnings per common share is determined by dividing the conversion spread value of the share-settled portion of the Convertible Notes as of the reporting date by the average share price over the reporting period. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the convertible debt was not in the money; therefore, no incremental shares were assumed converted or included in the diluted earnings per common share calculation below. For further details on the Convertible Notes, see Note 12. \n171\nThe following table reconciles numerators and denominators of CenterPoint Energy’s basic and diluted earnings per common share for the periods presented:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions, except per share and share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet income\n$\n1,019\n \n$\n917\n \n$\n1,057\n \nLess: Preferred stock dividend requirement (Note 11)\n—\n \n50\n \n49\n \nIncome available to common shareholders - basic and diluted\n$\n1,019\n \n$\n867\n \n$\n1,008\n \nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic\n643,163,000\n \n630,947,000\n \n629,415,000\n \nPlus: Incremental shares from assumed conversions:\nRestricted stock\n974,000\n \n2,232,000\n \n2,931,000\n \nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n644,137,000\n \n633,179,000\n \n632,346,000\n \nEarnings per Common Share:\nBasic \n$\n1.58\n \n$\n1.37\n \n$\n1.60\n \nDiluted \n$\n1.58\n \n$\n1.37\n \n$\n1.59\n \n(16)  \nReportable Segments \nThe Registrants’ determination of reportable segments considers the strategic operating units under which its CODM manages sales, allocates resources and assesses performance of various products and services to wholesale or retail customers in differing regulatory environments. \nAs of December 31, 2024, reportable segments by Registrant and information about each Registrant’s CODM were as follows:\nCenterPoint Energy\n•\nCenterPoint Energy’s Electric reportable segment consisted of electric transmission and distribution services in the Texas Gulf Coast area in the ERCOT region and electric transmission and distribution services primarily to southwestern Indiana and includes power generation and wholesale power operations in the MISO region.\n•\nCenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas reportable segment consists of (i) intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation and distribution for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas; and (ii) permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through CEIP. \n•\nCenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other category consists of energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services by Energy Systems Group through June 30, 2023, the date of the sale of Energy Systems Group, and corporate support operations that support all of CenterPoint Energy’s business operations. CenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other also includes office buildings and other real estate used for business operations.\nCenterPoint Energy’s CODM, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance for all of its reportable segments based on segment net income. The CODM uses segment net income to allocate resources as part of the budgeting and forecasting process as well as during periodic budget-to-actual reviews. \nHouston Electric\n•\nHouston Electric’s single reportable segment consisted of electric transmission services to transmission service customers in the ERCOT region and distribution service to REPs in the Texas Gulf Coast area that includes the city of Houston.\n172\nHouston Electric’s CODM, the President and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance for its single reportable segment based on segment net income. The CODM uses segment net income to allocate resources as part of the budgeting and forecasting process as well as during periodic budget-to-actual reviews.\nCERC\n•\nCERC’s single reportable segment following the Restructuring consisted of (i) intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation and distribution for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas; and (ii) permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through CEIP. \nCERC’s CODM, the President and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance for its single reportable segment based on segment net income. The CODM uses segment net income to allocate resources as part of the budgeting and forecasting process as well as during periodic budget-to-actual reviews.\nExpenditures for long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment.

The short-term lease agreement expired on December 31, 2022. Effective January 1, 2023, all temporary generation assets were leased under the long-term lease agreement. Expenses associated with the short-term lease, including carrying costs, are deferred to a regulatory asset and totaled $\n89\n million and $\n100\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe long-term lease agreement includes up to \n505\n MW of TEEEF, all of which was delivered as of December 31, 2022, triggering lease commencement at delivery, with an initial term ending in 2029 for all TEEEF leases. The total cash payments under the long-term lease totaled $\n664\n million, with the final $\n485\n million paid in 2022. Houston Electric derecognized the finance lease liability when the extinguishment criteria in Topic 405 - \nLiabilities\n was achieved. Per the terms of the agreement, lease payments are due and made in full by Houston Electric upon taking possession of the asset, relieving substantially all of the associated finance lease liability at that time. The remaining finance lease liability associated with the commenced long-term TEEEF agreement was not significant as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and relates to removal costs that will be incurred at the end of the lease term. As of December 31, 2024, Houston Electric had secured a first lien on the assets leased under the prepayment agreement, except for assets with lease payments totaling $\n79\n million, which is being held in an escrow account, not controlled by Houston Electric, and the funds will be released when a first lien can be secured by Houston Electric. Expenses associated with the long-term lease, including variable costs associated with the operation and maintenance of the temporary generation assets, depreciation expense on the right of use asset and carrying costs, are deferred to a regulatory asset as a recoverable cost under the 2021 Texas legislation and totaled $\n158\n million and $\n124\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For further discussion of the regulatory impacts, see Note 7.\n178\nThe components of lease cost, included in Operation and maintenance expense on the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income, are as follows for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston \nElectric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston \nElectric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston \nElectric\nCERC\n(in millions)\nOperating lease cost\n$\n6\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2\n \nShort-term lease cost\n12\n \n11\n \n—\n \n31\n \n30\n \n—\n \n167\n \n166\n \n1\n \nTotal lease cost (1)\n$\n18\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n33\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n173\n \n$\n167\n \n$\n3\n \n(1) CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric defer finance lease costs for TEEEF to Regulatory assets for recovery rather than to Depreciation and Amortization in the Statements of Consolidated Income.\nThe components of lease income were as follows for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston \nElectric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston \nElectric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston \nElectric\nCERC\n(in millions)\nOperating lease income\n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n3\n \nVariable lease income\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal lease income\n$\n8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n3\n \nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows for the periods presented:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston \nElectric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston \nElectric\nCERC\n(in millions)\nAssets:\nOperating ROU assets (1)\n$\n27\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n4\n \nFinance ROU assets (2)\n430\n \n430\n \n—\n \n526\n \n526\n \n—\n \nTotal leased assets\n$\n457\n \n$\n435\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n539\n \n$\n532\n \n$\n4\n \nLiabilities:\nCurrent operating lease liability (3)\n$\n3\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \nNon-current operating lease liability (4)\n25\n \n3\n \n14\n \n10\n \n5\n \n3\n \nTotal leased liabilities (5)\n$\n28\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n4\n \n(1)\nIncluded in \nOther assets\n in the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of accumulated amortization.\n(2)\nIncluded in \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n in the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of accumulated amortization.\n(3)\nIncluded in \nCurrent other liabilities\n in the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(4)\nIncluded in \nOther non-current liabilities\n in the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(5)\nFinance lease liabilities were not material as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for the Registrants’ finance and operating leases were as follows:\n179\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston \nElectric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston \nElectric\nCERC\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) - operating leases\n17.7\n2.9\n20.6\n4.7\n3.9\n3.1\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases\n4.92\n \n%\n4.11\n \n%\n5.03\n \n%\n4.13\n \n%\n4.09\n \n%\n3.60\n \n%\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) - finance leases\n4.5\n4.5\n— \n5.5\n5.5\n— \nWeighted-average discount rate - finance leases\n3.60\n \n%\n3.60\n \n%\n—\n \n3.60\n \n%\n3.60\n \n%\n—\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, finance lease liabilities were not significant to the Registrants.

Based on those evaluations, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, in each case, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Registrants’ internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants’ internal controls over financial reporting.\n181\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Registrants’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Registrants’ principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by CenterPoint Energy’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\nPertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Registrants;\n•\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Registrants are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Registrants; and\n•\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Registrants’ assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement has designed its internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management’s assessment included review and testing of both the design effectiveness and operating effectiveness of controls over all relevant assertions related to all significant accounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Registrants’ management, including their respective principal executive officers and principal financial officers, the Registrants conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Registrants’ evaluation under the framework in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n (2013), the Registrants’ management has concluded, in each case, that their internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, CenterPoint Energy’s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of CenterPoint Energy’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 which is set forth below. This report is not applicable to Houston Electric or CERC as they are not accelerated or large accelerated filers.\n182\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nCenterPoint Energy, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 20, 2025\n183\nItem 9B.\nOther Information\nNone.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, no director or officer of CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric or CERC \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C.  \n Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot Applicable.\nPART III\nItem 10.\nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nFor CenterPoint Energy, the information called for by Item 10, to the extent not set forth in “Information About Our Executive Officers” in Item 1 of Part I of this report, will be set forth in the definitive proxy statement relating to CenterPoint Energy’s 2025 annual meeting of shareholders pursuant to SEC Regulation 14A.
