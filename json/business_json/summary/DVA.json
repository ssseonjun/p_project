Organizations that provide charitable premium assistance may choose to withdraw from California, which would have an adverse impact on the ability of patients to afford Medicare premiums and Medicare supplemental and commercial coverage . In the past, bills similar to AB 290 have been introduced in other states, but none has become law .\n Potential impacts could cause us to incur substantial costs to oppose any such proposed requirements or measures, impact our dialysis center development plans . If passed and/or implemented, could materially reduce our revenues and increase our operating and other costs, adversely impact dialysis centers across the U.S.  making certain centers economically unviable, lead to the closure of certain centers, restrict the ability of dialysis patients to obtain and maintain optimal insurance coverage .\n Any such proposed or issued laws, requirements, rules and guidance could impact our business, including as may be described above . Failure on our part to adequately adjust to any resulting marketplace developments or regulatory compliance requirements, may, among other things, erode our patient base or reimbursement rates . We are, and may in the future be, a party to various lawsuits, demands, claims, claims and other legal matters .\n The healthcare industry is highly visible and politically charged . Any allegation against us, our personnel, representatives, vendors, or operations in such matters or matters that involve patients suffering adverse health outcomes, may harm our reputation, stock price, and it could impact our relationships and/or contracts related to our business . It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against u. e in the future .\n A substantial portion of our U.S. dialysis patient service revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payors as their primary payor . The majority of these patients have insurance policies that pay us on terms and at rates that are generally significantly higher than Medicare rates . As such our revenue and net income levels are sensitive to the number of our patients with higher-paying commercial insurance coverage .\n There are a number of factors that could drive a decline in the number or percentage of our patients covered under commercial insurance plans, including improved mortality, changes in the patient's or a family member's employment status, reduced availability of commercial health plans or reduced coverage by such plans through the ACA exchanges or otherwise due to changes to the laws, marketplace, healthcare regulatory system or otherwise .\n To the extent there are job losses in the U.S., we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under commercial plans . If we experience higher numbers of uninsured or underinsured patients, it also would result in an increase in uncollectible accounts . A material portion of both our commercial revenue and MA revenue is concentrated with a limited number of commercial payors .\n Our negotiations with commercial payors may relate to commercial fee-for-service contracts and value-based care (VBC) contracts . If we fail to maintain contracts with payors and other healthcare providers with competitive or favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows .\n In the event that our ongoing negotiations with commercial payors result in overall rate reductions in excess of overall rate increases, the cumulative effect could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . Payors have been attempting to design and implement plans that restrict or limit coverage for treatment needed by ESRD patients in the commercial market .\n The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a group health plan that limits the benefits for outpatient dialysis, but does so uniformly for all plan participants, does not violate the terms of the Medicare Secondary Payor Act . If more commercial or employer group health plans seek to implement or utilize plan designs that discourage or prevent ESRD patients from retaining their commercial coverage, it may lead to a decrease in the number of patients with commercial plans .\n Paying for coverage is a significant financial burden for many patients, and ESRD disproportionately affects the low-income population . Many patients with commercial and government insurance also rely on financial assistance from charitable organizations, such as the American Kidney Fund . Certain payors have challenged our patients' and other providers' patients' .\n If our assumptions about how kidney patients will respond to any change in financial assistance from charitable organizations are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . Our negotiations and relationships with payors may also be impacted by legislative or regulatory developments and associated legal rulings .\n Any changes by group health plans, health insurance issuers in the group and individual markets, or consumer choices resulting from these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition . Any decrease in payments we receive for services due to fewer patients being covered under commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial plans .\n Our integrated kidney care business manages patients and coordinates their care through value-based care arrangements with commercial payors and through government programs . There can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully implement our strategies . We have invested and expect to continue to invest substantial resources in the further development of our integrated care business .\n Implementing our expanded integrated kidney care strategies and value-based care initiatives at scale also increases certain execution and compliance risks associated with developing our operational, IT, billing and telehealth systems . These risks include failure to effectively maintain, operate or upgrade our information systems or those of third-party service providers upon which we rely .\n There can be no assurances that any other legislation or regulation that aligns with our strategy and investments will be extended, passed into law or enacted . The ultimate terms and conditions of any potential legislative or regulatory action impacting integrated kidney care, full capitation demonstrations or the existing CMMI payment models remain unclear . Failure on our part to adequately implement strategic initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our business .\n Our home-based dialysis services represented approximately 19% of our U.S. dialysis patient service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, and have increasingly become an important part of our overall strategy . CMS recently finalized a proposal to allow payment for acute kidney injury (AKI) renal dialysis service furnished to beneficiaries in their home .\n There is a limited number of available suppliers for certain critical home-based dialysis supplies, including key products provided by a supplier that was impacted by a severe weather event in 2024 . Any disruptions involving such supplies could materially impact our operations and require significant resources or operational changes in response . We may also be subject to associated risks related to our ability to successfully manage related operational initiatives, find, train and retain appropriate staff, contract with payors for appropriate reimbursement .\n An increased focus on home-based dialysis is also indicative of the generally evolving market for kidney care . Changes in the structure of and payment rates under the Medicare ESRD or Medicare Advantage programs or changes in state Medicaid or other non-Medicare government-based programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows .\n Under the ESRD PPS, bundled payments to a dialysis facility may be reduced by as much as 2% based on the facility's performance in specified quality measures . The bundled payment rate is also adjusted  for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index, a wage index and certain other factors . In certain instances, new injectable, intravenous or oral products may be reimbursed separately from the bundled payment .\n Uncertainty about future payment rates remains a material risk to our business . There is also risk that commercial insurers could seek to incorporate requirements or limitations associated with LCDs or CMS guidance into their contracted terms with dialysis providers, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue . We expect operating costs to continue to increase due to inflationary factors, such as increases in labor and supply costs .\n As a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) and subsequent legislation, an annual reduction (currently 2%) to Medicare payments took effect on April 1, 2013, and has been extended into 2032 . Failure to adequately develop and maintain our clinical or other operational systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows .\n Our MA business presents similar operating, clinical and financial risks as those related to the bundled payment system . We also contract with commercial payors that administer MA plans to provide their members with Medicare Part A, Part B and/or Part D benefits . CMS publishes a final rule for MA program rates each year and uncertainty about future payment rates remains a material risk .\n The number of our patients with primary Medicare coverage may be subject to change, particularly with the effectiveness of the Cures Act, which allows Medicare-eligible individuals with ESRD to enroll in MA managed care plans . Increased political pressures to reduce government spending, including potential cuts to Medicare funding, may create additional risks to payment rates .\n In 2019, we entered into a Nationwide Dialysis Services contract with the VA that includes five separate one-year renewal periods throughout the term of the contract . Since we are a non-VA provider, these reimbursements are tied to a percentage of Medicare reimbursement, and we have exposure to any dialysis reimbursement changes made by CMS . The current contract expires at the end of September 2025 .\n State Medicaid programs are increasingly adopting Medicare-like bundled payment systems, but sometimes these payment systems are poorly defined and are implemented without any claims processing infrastructure, or patient or facility adjusters . Medicaid payment and enrollment changes, along with similar changes to other non-Medicare government programs, could reduce the rates paid by these programs for dialysis and related services .\n We face increasing labor costs generally, and in particular, we continue to face increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring skilled clinical personnel, including nurses, due to a nationwide shortage of such personnel . The current labor market is challenging and continues to experience volatility, uncertainty and labor supply shortages, particularly in healthcare . We have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased labor cost, including through elevated compensation levels .\n The ongoing nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations . We compete for nurses with hospitals and other healthcare providers . We also face competition in attracting and retaining talent for key leadership positions that are responsible for developing and executing the Company's business strategy and operational initiatives . Political or other efforts at the national or local level could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows .\n Our industry has also experienced increased union organizing activities . Union petitions have been filed in nine of our clinics in California and eight of these petitions are in different stages of the voting process . If a significant portion of our teammates were to become unionized, we could experience, among other things, potential additional work stoppages or other business disruptions .\n We must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and privacy of PHI . In the U.S., these regulations include, without limitation, HIPAA and its implementing privacy, security, and related regulations . We are also required to report known breaches of PHI and other certain personal information consistent with applicable breach reporting requirements .\n If we fail to comply with privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, it could harm our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . Data protection laws are evolving globally, and may continue to add additional compliance costs and legal risks to our international operations . At the federal level, this includes proposed updates to the HIPAA Security Rule .\n New state laws, regulations may add additional costs to U.S. operations . Cybersecurity risks have increased in part because of the use of new technologies . New laws governing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies may also add costs to our operations . We could be subject to damage awards in private litigation or penalties that, in some cases, would have a material adverse impact .\n Our business and operations rely on the secure and continuous processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks . The increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including, among others, foreign state agents, have become more relevant and important given the information security issues and risks .\n CHC has publicly reported online and in notices to affected individuals that it identified protected health information (PHI), or personally identifiable information (PII), from users of the CHC systems . CHC informed the Company that a small number of patients had certain PHI exposed as a result of this breach and CHC is taking responsibility for notifying these patients .\n Cybersecurity requires ongoing investment and diligence against evolving threats, says CEO . \"Self-learning or \"artificial intelligence\" features into information technology capabilities may intensify the cybersecurity and reputational risks we face given its novel and untested nature . Emerging and advanced security threats, including, without limitation, coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security .\n Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems (including our networks) and data, or to defend against cybersecurity attacks, could subject us to m\n As malicious cyber activity escalates, including activity that originates outside of the U.S., and as we continue with certain remote work arrangements and a broadened technology footprint, the risks we face relating to transmission of data and our use of service providers outside of our network . There have been increased international, federal and state and other privacy, data protection and security enforcement efforts and we expect this trend to continue .\n We are also subject to the risk associated with our increased reliance on third party service providers . A substantial portion of our total vendor spend concentrated with a limited number of third party suppliers . We rely on these third-party suppliers and service providers to provide the products or services we require, and this reliance subjects us to risks arising from the loss of control over these services .\n liers and service providers do not meet our needs for the products and services they supply, including in the event of supply chain disruptions due to global events, geopolitical instability, trade disputes, natural disasters or severe weather events . We are not able to find adequate alternative sources for these products or services on a timely or cost-effective basis . Technology related to the products critical to the services we provide is subject to new developments .\n Current macroeconomic conditions also have resulted in global supply chain challenges, as described in the risk factor under the heading \"risk factor\" External conditions, including those related to general economic, marketplace and global health conditions, are also a risk factor for PD dialysis . PD's home-based dialysis business in 2024 and early portion of 2025 will be slowed .\n Medicare bundles certain pharmaceuticals into the ESRD PPS payment rate at industry average doses and prices . Variations above the industry average may be subject to partial reimbursement through the PPS outlier reimbursement policy . Physician practice patterns, including their independent determinations as to appropriate pharmaceuticals and dosing, are subject to change .\n Increased utilization of certain pharmaceuticals whose costs are included in a bundled reimbursement rate could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows . Drivers of these risks include, among other things, the risk that CMS may not provide adequate funding in the Medicare Part B ESRD payment in the transitional or post-transitional period .\n We cannot predict, at this time, whether CMS' TDAPA amounts for oral phosphate binders will adequately account for the inclusion of these oral medications and the additional costs associated with dialysis providers having to supply such drugs . If the government or other payors implement other new requirements or protocols for patients to receive the drug and include pricing in the bundle, we could experience significant fluctuations in our associated levels of operating income .\n Failure to prepare, develop and implement processes that provide for appropriate availability and use in our clinics in compliance with applicable laws, including those related to controlled substances, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . Failure to successfully contract with manufacturers for competitive pricing, failure to  contract with the government or other payors for appropriate reimbursement, could result in significant legal expense .\n Operating in this market requires us to build or retain our patient population through acquisition or referrals, or that develop and maintain our relationships with physicians and hospitals in both the dialysis and pre-dialysis space . Our largest competitor, Fresenius Medical Care, manufactures a full line of dialysis supplies and equipment in addition to owning and operating dialysis centers .\n Medicare regulations require medical directors for each of our Medicare certified dialysis centers . The aging of the nephrologist population and opportunities presented by our competitors or other hospitals and other healthcare providers may negatively impact a medical director's decision to enter into or extend his or her agreement with us . If we are unable to obtain qualified medical directors to provide supervision of the  centers, we may be unable to satisfy the federal Medicare requirements associated with medical directors and to operate our centers .\n If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to law, rule or regulation, new competition, a perceived decrease in the quality of service levels at our centers or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . As we continue to expand our offerings across the kidney care continuum, our ability to enter into and maintain integrated kidney care relationships with payors, physicians and other providers may have an impact .\n If we are unable to successfully adapt to these dynamics, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . Emerging entrants are pursuing opportunities to participate in the CMMI payment models or establish value-based care programs . The decline in annual growth rate of ESKD dialysis patient population was 0.4% from 2021 to 2022 .\n Any decrease in growth rates for the ESRD patient population could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . We face ongoing competition from large and medium-sized providers, among others, for acquisition targets in those markets . We have continued efforts to seek growth opportunities, such as by expanding our business into various international markets .\n If we are not able to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . If we experience significant patient attrition either as a result of new business activities in the dialysis or pre-dialysis space by our existing competitors, other market participants, new entrants, new technology or other forms of competition, it could materially adversely affect our business .\n Our U.S. integrated kidney care and . other ancillary services are subject to many of the same risks, regulations and laws, as described in the risk factors related to our dialysis business . ancial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted and we may have to write off our investment and incur other exit costs ."
