  "item1_summary": " Aircraft fleet renewal is an important component of our environmental sustainability strategy, which will continue to require extensive capital investment in future periods . The project cost approximately $4.2 billion and was funded through debt issuance, existing cash and a Port Authority contribution of approximately $500 million . We entered into loan agreements to fund a portion of the construction, which are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (\"balance sheets\") as debt .\n A substantial majority of the project costs were funded through the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation (\"RAIC\"), a California public benefit corporation, using a revolving credit facility . Loans made under the credit facility are being repaid with the proceeds from the City of Los Angeles' purchase of completed project assets . In 2024, we had cash outflows of approximately $4.0 billion related to repayments of our debt and finance leases, including approximately $1.1 billion of early repayments .\n Fitch and S&P Global upgraded their credit ratings of Delta to BBB-, an investment grade rating . The principal amount of our debt and finance leases was $16.2 billion at December 31, 2024 . We have now achieved investment-grade ratings across the major credit rating agencies, including Moody's .\n Board of Directors approved and we will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on March 20, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 27, 2025 . Total dividend payments during the year ended December 31, 2024 were $321 million . Delta Air Lines was in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements at December 31, 2024 .\n The SkyMiles program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations . The aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the program was $8.8 billion at December 31, 2024 . A hypothetical 10% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs .\n Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies, such as credit card, ridesharing, retail, car rental and hotel companies . Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period . A hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of the ETV of a mile would have decreased total operating revenue by less than 1% for the year ended December 31, 2024 .\n Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K: We sell miles to American Express which are then provided to their customers under the co-brand credit card program and the Membership Rewards program . Cardholders earn miles for making purchases using co-branded cards, and certain cardholders may also receive baggage fee waivers, lounge access, priority boarding and other benefits while traveling on Delta .\n Revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight is recognized as travel-related services in passenger revenue . The timing of mile redemptions can vary widely; however, the majority of new miles have historically been redeemed within two years of being earned . For tickets that we sell on behalf of other airlines, we reduce the air traffic liability .\n At December 31, 2024, the aggregate air traffic liability balance was $7.1 billion . Ticket breakage estimates are primarily based on historical experience, ticket contract terms and customers’ travel behavior . A hypothetical 10% change in the amount of tickets estimated to expire unused would result in an impact of less than 1% of total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 .\n The key assumptions in our impairment tests include forecasted revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) current discount rates, (3) observable market transactions and (4) anticipated changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., changes in slot access and/or availability, additional Open Skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals)\n Changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinite-lived to definite-lived . Factors which could cause impairment include (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs, (3) lower passenger demand as a result of weakened U.S. and global economies or other factors .\n As of December 31, 2024, the funded status for these plans recorded on our balance sheets was $938 million . The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations, plan assets, net periodic cost/(benefit) are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy of plan participants .\n The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a long-term return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target . This is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity, fixed income, real assets, hedge funds and other assets and instruments . We review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually .\n Our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by ERISA and any additional applicable legislation . Under current legislation, any required funding would be amortized over a rolling 15-year period . Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets, statutory requirements and demographic data for participants .\n Delta Air Lines, Inc. adopted this standard effective January 1, 2024 . The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" The standard requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items by reportable segment .

Reconciliations below may not calculate exactly due to rounding . The company recorded adjustments to other benefit-related items of approximately $130 million .\n The volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance . The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs . The adjusted profit sharing adjustment provides a more meaningful comparison of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry . Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K: Shareholders should be able to view the results of the company's financial results .\n The following table shows a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities (a GAAP measure) to free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) Free cash flow is presented because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for use for debt service or corporate initiatives .\n Delta Air Lines, Inc. cted for airport construction, to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow that is core to our operations . The amount of operating cost incurred per ASM during a reporting period is also referred to as \"unit cost\" CASM-Ex is \"CASM\" and \"Ex\" is \"Unit cost\"\n The amount of passenger revenue earned per ASM is also referred to as \"passenger unit revenue\" One revenue-paying passenger transported one mile is one RPM . The number of revenue passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the number of miles flown by those passengers during that period . The actual results of this sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel .\n At December 31, 2024, Monroe Airways had $14.5 billion of fixed-rate debt, $0.9 billion of variable-rate debt and $0.4 billion leaves . An increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by $620 million . Foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue, expense and equity investments denominated in foreign currencies .\n At December 31, 2024, our investments denominated in foreign currencies (AirFrance-KLM, China Eastern, Hanjin-KAL and LATAM) were recorded at a fair value of $1.6 billion .
