Through our Reinvention Services we bring together our capabilities across strategy, consulting, technology, operations, Song and Industry X with our deep industry expertise to create and deliver solutions and services for our clients. Our purpose is to deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity, and we measure our success by the 360° value we create for all our stakeholders.\nFiscal 2025 Highlights\nWe serve clients and manage our business through three geographic markets: Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific. These markets bring together all of our Reinvention Services with both local and global talent and solutions.\nWe go to market by industry, leveraging our deep expertise across our five industry groups—Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources. We deliver two types of work: Consulting and Managed Services. \n$69.7B\n \nin revenues\nOur revenues are derived primarily from Forbes Global 2000 companies, governments and government agencies. Today, we work across every major market with more than 9,000 clients, including the world’s largest companies; three quarters of the Fortune Global 100 and 500. \nAs of August 31, 2025, we employed approximately\n779,000\n \npeople. \nWe have long-term relationships and have partnered with \n195\n \nof our top \n200\n clients for \n10+\n \nyears.\nFiscal 2025 Investments\n$1.5B\n$0.8B\n$1.0B\nacross 23 strategic acquisitions\nin research and development\nin learning and professional development\nDuring fiscal 2025, we continued to make significant investments—in strategic acquisitions, in research and development (R&D) in our assets, platforms and industry and functional solutions, in patents and pending patents and in attracting, retaining and developing people. These investments help us to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness in the marketplace. Our disciplined acquisition strategy, which is an engine to fuel organic growth, is focused on scaling our business in high-growth areas; adding skills and capabilities in new areas; and deepening our industry and functional expertise. In fiscal 2025, we invested $1.5 billion across 23 strategic acquisitions, $0.8 billion in R&D, and approximately $1.0 billion in learning and professional development, including approximately 47 million training hours.\nTable of Contents\nACCENTURE\n 2025 FORM 10-K\nItem 1. Business\n3\nWe also use our investment capacity to drive early leadership in areas of growth. For example, our early and decisive decision in fiscal 2023 to invest significantly to become a leader in generative AI with a $3 billion multi-year investment has positioned us to capture this new area of spend for our clients.\nGeographic Markets\nOur three geographic markets—Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific—bring together our Reinvention Services in teams, which typically consist of industry and functional experts, AI, data and technology specialists and professionals with local market knowledge and experience, to meet client needs. The geographic markets have primary responsibility for building and sustaining long-term client relationships; bringing together our expertise from around the globe and collaborating across our business to sell and deliver our full range of solutions and services; ensuring client satisfaction; and achieving revenue and profitability objectives.\nWhile we serve clients in locally relevant ways, our global footprint and scale in every major country give us the ability to leverage our experience and people from around the world to accelerate outcomes for our clients. \nOur three geographic markets are our reporting segments. The percent of our revenues represented by each market is shown at right.\n \nReinvention Services \nEffective September 1, 2025, we brought all of our services, which are described below, together into a single, integrated business unit called Reinvention Services. With this change, our client-focused growth model is bringing together all our capabilities across strategy, consulting, technology, operations, Song and Industry X, including deep industry and functional expertise across these capabilities, plus our technology ecosystem partnerships, to create more leading solutions faster and embed AI and data more easily into creating and delivering our solutions and services. As the reinvention partner of choice for our clients, we are building the digital core and helping reinvent nearly every part of the enterprise, everything from functions that are common across industries like HR and Finance, to industry-specific functions like manufacturing and capital projects. With the majority of our large deals today already involving capabilities across multiple areas, the full rollout of our model is designed to make it faster and simpler to sell and deliver everything Accenture offers across our client base, while embedding more AI and data and equipping our people.\nStrategy and Consulting\nWe work with C-suite executives, leaders and boards of the world’s leading organizations, helping them reinvent nearly every part of their enterprise to set their strategic priorities, build their digital core, reinvent processes and reimagine their workforce to drive greater growth, enhance competitiveness, and deliver sustainable 360° stakeholder value. Our deep industry and functional expertise is supported by proprietary assets and platforms that help organizations transform faster and become more resilient. Underpinned by technology, data, analytics, AI, change management, talent, learning and sustainability, these capabilities help architect and accelerate all aspects of an organization’s reinvention.

We help organizations with reinvented operations, enabled by SynOps, our proprietary AI-powered, cloud-enabled platform that empowers people with data, processes, automation and a broad ecosystem of technology partners to transform enterprise operations at speed and scale. Our experience from operations also informs our strategy and consulting capabilities to better serve our clients.\nS\nong\nWe help our clients create new, hyper-personalized experiences and services that are intelligently designed to foster loyalty and drive growth by making customer interactions more compelling, useful, and simple from initial interaction through ongoing customer service. We also build the strong digital core that supports the customer agenda. Our suite of solutions and services spans design, digital products, marketing, sales, commerce, and customer service.

We have expanded our capabilities over the last few years to include helping our clients to digitally transform how their capital projects are planned, managed and executed, from plant and asset construction to public infrastructure, power grids and data centers. We collaborate closely with our technology ecosystem partners to help our clients achieve compressed transformations by redefining how their products are designed and engineered, tested, sourced and supplied, manufactured, and serviced, returned and renewed. Our solutions and services include the use of data and transformative technologies such as advanced AI, artificial reality/virtual reality, advanced robotics and digital twins.\nEcosystem Partner Relationships\nOur successful strategy for more than a decade has been to be the number-one partner for the technology ecosystem. As technology is front and center for every client, we are the number-one partner for all of our top 10 ecosystem partners. These partners are among the world’s largest technology companies by revenue, and they are seeking deeper partnerships with us as they look for help to turn their technology into business outcomes and scale the adoption of AI. In fiscal 2025, we expanded our partnerships beyond the top 10 in AI and data and created new ones with companies that are becoming critical to many of our clients, which also want us to help them scale their client and customer relationships. \nClients\nWe continue to be the reinvention partner of choice, serving approximately 9,000 clients including a significant portion of the Fortune Global 100 and 500. We believe our global footprint and breadth of capabilities mean we can serve more of our clients’ needs for large-scale transformations than any other player in the industry. Our deep and long-standing relationships mean we know our clients and their industries thoroughly. We have long-term relationships and have partnered with\n 195 of our top 200 \nclients for 10 or more years, and have 305 Diamond clients, our largest client relationships.\nIndustry Groups  \nWe believe the depth and breadth of our industry expertise is a key competitive advantage which allows us to bring client-specific industry solutions and services to our clients to accelerate reinvention and value creation. Our industry focus gives us an understanding of industry evolution, business issues and trends, industry operating models, capabilities and processes and new and emerging technologies. The breadth of our industry expertise enables us to create solutions that are informed by cross industry experience.

Cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving, becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and maintaining effective security measures and protocols.\n \nCybersecurity Governance\nOur enterprise risk management program is an annual and ongoing process designed to identify, assess and manage Accenture’s risk exposures over multiple time horizons. Our enterprise risk management program and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to appropriately escalate key risks to the Board of Directors, as well as to analyze potential risks for disclosure\n. \nAs part of our Board of Directors’ role in overseeing the Company’s enterprise risk management program, the Board devotes time and attention to cybersecurity and data privacy-related risks, with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors responsible for overseeing information technology risk exposures, including cybersecurity, data privacy and data security.\n \nThe Audit Committee receives reports on cybersecurity and data privacy matters and related risk exposures from management, including our chief information security officer (“CISO”), at least twice a year and more frequently as applicable. In addition, the Audit Committee’s quarterly enterprise risk management updates include developments regarding IT security and data protection. Recent topics included integrated third-party risk management, the evolving AI security governance and innovation landscape and client data protection. The Audit Committee regularly updates the Board on such matters and \nthe Board also periodically receives reports from management directly.\n We have protocols by which cybersecurity incidents that meet established reporting thresholds are escalated within the company and, where appropriate, reported promptly to the Board.\n \nOur CISO leads all aspects of Accenture’s global cybersecurity program, including security operations, client data protection, cyber risk reduction strategies, incident response, cybersecurity integration of acquisitions and our industry-leading behavioral change program\n.\n \nOur CISO joined Accenture in 1995. Prior to being appointed CISO in 2020, he helped create Accenture’s information security capability and led the implementation of information security technology. Previously, he managed large technology transformations for Accenture and for clients in the United States, Japan and Australia. Our CISO reports to our Chief Operating Officer and is supported by a team of over 1,000 people with expertise in technical architecture and security operations; governance, risk and compliance; client data protection; behavioral change; and cyber incident response, many of whom hold cybersecurity certifications and possess deep technical knowledge and experience.\nOur information security team maintains an extensive governance network, including formal relationships with other organizations within Accenture through our Situation and Action Committee, which includes representatives from our markets and services and the legal, information technology, corporate services and sustainability, data privacy and business resilience services teams. In addition, our cyber incident response efforts are overseen by a cross-functional leadership team including our CISO, our General Counsel and our Chief Marketing Officer."
