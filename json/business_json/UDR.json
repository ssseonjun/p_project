    "item1": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nUDR is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, disposes of, and manages multifamily apartment communities in targeted markets located in the United States. At December 31, 2024, our consolidated real estate portfolio consisted of 169 communities located in 21 markets, consisting of 55,696 completed apartment homes, which are held directly or through our subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we have an ownership interest in 10,860 completed or to-be-completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships, including 6,436 apartment homes owned by entities in which we hold preferred equity investments. At December 31, 2024, the Company was not developing any communities, although the Company was incurring and capitalizing costs directly related to predevelopment activities in preparation of future development commencements. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company completed the development of two communities located in Tampa, Florida and Addison, Texas, with a total of 415 apartment homes.\nUDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as the “Code.” To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. In 2024, we declared total distributions of $1.70 per common share and paid dividends of $1.695 per common share.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDividends\n    \nDividends\n​\n​\nDeclared in\n​\nPaid in\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2024\nFirst Quarter\n​\n$\n 0.4250\n​\n$\n 0.4200\nSecond Quarter\n​\n \n 0.4250\n​\n \n 0.4250\nThird Quarter\n​\n \n 0.4250\n​\n \n 0.4250\nFourth Quarter\n​\n \n 0.4250\n​\n \n 0.4250\nTotal\n​\n$\n 1.7000\n​\n$\n 1.6950\n​\nUDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. Our website is \nwww.udr.com\n. The information contained on our website, including any information referred to in this Report as being available on our website, is not a part of or incorporated into this Report.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were 189.8 million units in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) outstanding, of which 176.6 million OP Units (including 0.1 million of general partnership units), or 93.0%, were owned by UDR and 13.2 million OP Units, or 7.0%, were owned by outside limited partners. As of December 31, 2024, there were 32.4 million units in the DownREIT Partnership (“DownREIT Units”) outstanding, of which 23.0 million, or 71.0%, were owned by UDR and its subsidiaries and 9.4 million, or 29.0%, were owned by outside limited partners. The consolidated financial statements of UDR include the noncontrolling interests of the unitholders in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership.\nHuman Capital Management\n​\nWe strive to attract and retain high-performing talent. As of December 31, 2024, our Company had 1,419 full-time associates and 13 part-time associates, all of whom are dedicated to the success of our organization. Within this workforce, 1,007 associates are focused on roles directly associated with our communities, while the remaining associates contribute to various corporate functions. Our commitment extends to the entire employee lifecycle, encompassing recruitment, onboarding, development, engagement, and retention. Our overarching objective is to enhance the associate experience, foster diversity, and maintain a motivated and committed workforce that fuels our growth and talent retention. This dedication to our UDR culture, values, and behaviors directly influences improved engagement, productivity, and the overall success of our organization.\n \n​\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe strive to create a culture focused on a philosophy of collaboration, trust, and innovation where every individual feels welcomed, valued, proud, and empowered to do their best work. By prioritizing and enhancing the associate experience, we aim to enhance engagement levels, leading to increased customer satisfaction, higher employee retention, and superior results. We report to our Board of Directors at least annually with respect to our human capital initiatives, including evaluations and analyses.\n \n​\nAssociate Compensation\n \n​\nAttracting, nurturing, and retaining top-tier, diverse talent across our organization is essential to our long-term success. An integral part of this process is our commitment to fair and attractive compensation practices. We continue to utilize general market, as well as industry and geographically specific public compensation data to make informed decisions and adjust our salary ranges accordingly, so we can remain competitive and attract and retain top talent. We seek to stay up to date with the latest trends in the job market in order to provide fair and competitive compensation packages for our associates. Our compensation programs are designed to include performance-driven bonuses. These metrics are presented annually to our executive leadership and our Board of Directors for oversight purposes.\n \n​\nAssociate Growth and Development\n \n​\nWe firmly believe that ongoing development is essential for associate job satisfaction, effectiveness, career progression, and retention. New associates participate in a comprehensive two-day onboarding process that covers our culture, values, mission, and administrative procedures. In 2024, we piloted a new onboarding roadmap to support onboarding new operations associates and decrease time to productivity. In addition, we offer a wide range of training opportunities tailored to individual needs.\n \n​\nThroughout 2024, the talent development team assessed the current training curriculum, audited the quality of existing content, and began documenting opportunities for improvement. As we look to the future, our long-term strategy will focus on UDR-developed content that supports the enhancement of skills and competencies at all levels and emphasizes personalized learning paths, ongoing development opportunities, and career progression. \n​\nDuring 2024, we introduced two digital customer experience service training courses and subsequent leader guides to approximately 1,200 associates to improve overall customer service skills and increase resident satisfaction and loyalty. In addition, more than 450 UDR associates completed a DiSC assessment, which is a personality tool that measures preferences and tendencies, not skill or ability. Finally, in 2024 more than 400 leaders across the Company participated in in-person experiential training, leveraging hands-on learning activities to improve team effectiveness, trust, communication, and collaboration.\n​\nIn total, over 6,000 training courses are available to our associates, spanning topics such as leasing skills, property maintenance, customer service, project management, and leadership development. In 2024, our associates collectively invested 38,225 hours in training, averaging 27 hours per full time associate. By the end of 2024, 90% of associates had completed annual IT security training, fair housing, harassment, workplace violence, diversity and inclusion, and business ethics training.\n \n​\nCertifications play a crucial role in career progression in the apartment industry. We actively encourage our associates to pursue professional certifications that align with their interests and benefit the Company. These certifications range from master's degree programs to certified property manager programs or technical licenses. We offer partial tuition reimbursement to support associates in attaining these certifications. \n \n​\nAdditionally, in 2024, the Company put greater focus on organizational development and succession planning to help ensure UDR has the right talent in the right positions to drive success and growth, as well as business continuity during leadership transitions.\n \n​\nDiversity and Inclusion\n \n​\nWe prioritize respect, fairness, and the promotion of diverse perspectives, which contribute to our Company's growth and success. Our commitment extends to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace environment that facilitates the development and advancement of all associates.\n \n​\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024, our workforce is comprised of 61% male and 39% female associates, with an ethnic composition of 51% White, 27% Hispanic/Latino, 13% Black, 3% Asian, and 6% Other. Our management team (including resident services managers and more senior job classifications) reflects a gender balance of 59% male and 41% female, with an ethnic breakdown of 60% White and 40% non-White. Over the three-year period ending December 31, 2024, 533 promotions occurred, with 45% of those promoted to resident services manager, director, or more senior job classifications being female and 42% non-White.\n \n​\nOur commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion remains as we strive to create a healthy and diverse work environment and attract candidates from all backgrounds, ethnicities, and genders.\n \n​\nAssociate Engagement and Outreach\n \n​\nThroughout 2024, we listened to our associates through quarterly pulse surveys, and leveraging associate feedback implemented several measures aimed at improving communication, making data-driven decisions, and promoting collaboration between our operations and corporate teams. We will continue to enhance our active listening strategy to drive continuous improvement across our business. \n \n​\nWe believe that our associates should be active in their communities, and we support their efforts. In 2024, we introduced an enhanced volunteer policy that continues to provide associates with up to eight paid hours annually for volunteer activities. Previously, volunteer opportunities were limited to one or two company-sponsored events per year with designated organizations. The updated policy now allows associates the flexibility to volunteer at any time throughout the year with a charitable organization of their choice. Through the policy, UDR provided 1,050 hours of paid time off to associates for volunteer work with over 30 local organizations. We also organized food, clothing, and blood drives, as well as initiatives to promote non-profit organizations and causes, fostering a culture of giving back.\n \n​\nEmployee Health, Wellness and Benefits\n \n​\nThe health, wellness, and safety of our associates are paramount to UDR. We maintain an inclusive culture by prioritizing the well-being of our associates. \n \n​\nIn 2024, we upgraded our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and increased enrollment by 10%. Our EAP includes counseling services, educational resources, and tools, including workshops and seminars on stress management, nutrition, and well-being for associates, partners, and teen-aged dependents. We also invested in virtual and in-person wellness fairs aimed at providing associates learning opportunities on topics ranging from stress management and mental health to financial fitness. We continue to leverage our Lifestyle Spending Account, which provides associates with $1,000 annually to spend as they choose bolstering associate wellness and satisfaction.\n \n​\nOur commitment to associate benefits is underscored by a third-party benefits survey, conducted in 2024, where 84% of respondents stated they understood their benefits and 64% believed that UDR offered a benefit package that is satisfactory relative to other companies in the industry.\n​\nReporting Segments\nWe report in two segments: \nSame-Store Communities\n and \nNon-Mature Communities/Other\n.\nOur S\name-Store Communities\n segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to January 1, 2023, and held as of December 31, 2024. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.\nOur \nNon-Mature Communities/Other \nsegment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in \nSame-Store Communities, \nincluding, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our operating segments, see Note 16, \nReportable Segments\n, in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Objectives \nOur principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities in a sustainable manner to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:\n●\nown and operate a diversified portfolio of apartments in targeted markets in the United States, which are characterized by strong total income growth, high working age population growth, relatively robust rental versus single-family home affordability and favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders;\n●\nmanage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities;\n●\nempower our associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively to improve resident satisfaction;\n●\nmeasure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and\n●\nmanage our capital structure with the intent of lowering our relative cost of capital to enhance profitability and predictability of liquidity, earnings and dividends.\n2024 Highlights\nCommitment to Shareholders\n●\n \nIn July 2024, the Company marked its 52\nnd\n year as a REIT and, in October 2024, paid its 208\nth\n consecutive quarterly dividend. The Company’s annualized declared 2024 dividend of $1.70 represented a 1.2% increase over the previous year.\nEarnings Results\n·\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $84.8 million as compared to $439.5 million in the prior year. The primary drivers for the decrease were lower gains from dispositions of real estate as we sold fewer assets in 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, and lower interest income and other income/(expense) primarily driven by a $37.3 million non-cash loan reserve partially offset by higher notes receivable balances. These were partially offset by higher total net operating income (“NOI”).\n●\nTotal revenues increased 2.7% over the prior year primarily due to overall market rent growth and communities acquired and completion of developments during 2024 and 2023, partially offset by dispositions of real estate in 2024 and 2023.\n·\n \nWe achieved Same-Store revenue growth of 2.3% and Same-Store NOI growth of 1.5%.\nInvesting and Developments\n·\nWe completed the development of two communities located in Tampa, Florida and Addison, Texas, with a total of 415 apartment homes.\n·\nWe recognized a gain of $16.9 million from the sale of an operating community located in Arlington, Virginia.\n·\nWe received distributions totaling $102.4 million from the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships. \n●\nWe contributed $35.0 million to four joint ventures that own and operate four operating communities with a total of 818 apartment homes.\n·\nWe funded an additional $32.2 million to two of our notes receivable investments\n.\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBalance Sheet\n·\nWe issued $300.0 million of 5.125% medium-term notes due September 1, 2034.\n \nThe net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under our commercial paper program.\n·\nWe amended our Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date to August 31, 2028, with two six-month extension options and amended our Term Loan to include a twelve-month extension option.\n·\nWe amended our Working Capital Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from January 12, 2025, to January 12, 2026.\nESG Report \nWe published our 2024 ESG Report on our website, which discloses our environmental and social initiatives, programs, and performance. The report’s ESG disclosures were, to the extent applicable, prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (core), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards, and the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) framework.\n​\nRefer to Item 7, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\n for further information on the Company’s activities in 2024.\n​\nOur Strategic Vision \nOur strategic vision is to be the multifamily public REIT of choice for investors. We intend to realize this vision by executing on our strategic objectives, which are:\n1.\nMaintaining a Diversified Portfolio and Allocating Capital to Accretive Investment Opportunities\n2.\nMaintaining a Strong Balance Sheet\n3.\nConsistently Driving Operating Excellence\n4.\nAdvancing a Strong Corporate Culture and Striving for High Resident Satisfaction\nMaintaining a Diversified Portfolio and Allocating Capital to Accretive Investment Opportunities\nWe believe greater portfolio diversification, as defined by geographic concentration, location within a market (i.e., urban or suburban) and property quality (i.e., A or B), reduces the volatility of our same-store growth throughout the real estate cycle, appeals to a wider renter and investor audience, lessens the market risk associated with owning a homogenous portfolio, and provides more opportunities for accretive external growth when appropriate. Diversified characteristics of our portfolio include:\n●\nour consolidated apartment portfolio includes 169 communities located in 21 markets throughout the U.S., including both coastal and sunbelt locations;\n●\nour communities that are located proximate to each other within a market provide enhanced economics; and\n●\nour mix of urban/suburban communities is approximately 30%/70% and our mix of A/B quality properties is approximately 44%/56%.\nWe are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation and income growth, high propensity to rent, strong relative affordability for rental versus homeownership, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. Portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions \nWhen evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider a wide variety of factors, including:\n●\nhigh working age population growth, relatively robust rental versus single-family home affordability, measured long-term new supply growth, overall potential for strong total income growth;\n●\nthe tax and regulatory environment of the market in which the property is located;\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\ngeographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale;\n●\nour climate assessments for the market and sub-market in which the property is located;\n●\nconstruction quality, condition, design and sustainability features of, or the potential to implement sustainability initiatives at, the property;\n●\ncurrent and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;\n●\nability of the property’s projected returns to exceed our cost of capital;\n●\npotential for capital appreciation of the property;\n●\nability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment;\n●\nterms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;\n●\noccupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity;\n●\nprospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property; and\n●\ncompetition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area.\nWe regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include:\n●\nwhether it is in a market targeted for divestment or a reduction in investment;\n●\ncurrent market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset;\n●\npotential increases in new construction in the market area;\n●\nareas with low job growth prospects;\n●\nnear- and long-term capital expenditure needs for the asset; and\n●\noperating efficiencies.\nThe following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated year-end ownership position for the past five years (\ndollars in thousands\n):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\n    \n2021\n    \n2020\nHomes acquired\n \n​\n 173\n(a)\n​\n 1,889\n​\n​\n 433\n \n​\n 5,426\n \n​\n 1,642\nHomes disposed \n \n​\n 214\n​\n​\n 1,604\n(b)\n​\n 90\n \n​\n 651\n \n​\n 599\nHomes owned at December 31, \n \n​\n 55,696\n \n​\n 55,550\n \n​\n 54,999\n \n​\n 53,229\n \n​\n 48,283\nTotal real estate owned, at cost\n​\n$\n 16,213,363\n​\n$\n 16,023,859\n​\n$\n 15,570,072\n​\n$\n 14,740,803\n​\n$\n 13,071,472\n(a)\nIn January 2024, the Company acquired its joint venture partner’s common equity interest in a 173 apartment home operating community. The community was previously owned by a consolidated joint venture of the Company.\n(b)\nIncludes 1,328 apartment homes from the partial sale of four operating communities to a newly formed joint venture.\nDevelopment Activities\nOur objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. How demographic trends, economic drivers, and multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the long-term \n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nand our portfolio strategy generally govern our review process on where and when to allocate development capital. At December 31, 2024, the Company was not developing any communities, although the Company was incurring and capitalizing costs directly related to predevelopment activities in preparation of future development commencements. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company completed the development of two communities located in Tampa, Florida and Addison, Texas, with a total of 415 apartment homes.\nRedevelopment Activities\nOur objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $51.4 million in major renovations, which included major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. As of December 31, 2024, the Company\n had no communities at which it was conducting substantial redevelopment activities\n.\nJoint Venture and Partnership Activities\nWe have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.\nMaintaining a Strong Balance Sheet\nWe maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. We have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate.\nAs part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities.\nConsistently Driving Operational Excellence\nInvestment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and helps us to better meet the changing needs of our business and our residents. Our residents can conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including completing online leasing applications and renewals and submitting maintenance or other requests throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal or, increasingly, a smart-device application.\nAs a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents’ satisfaction has improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. Web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes.\nAdvancing a Strong Corporate Culture and Ensuring High Resident Satisfaction\nRefer to \nHuman Capital Management\n section above\n,\n for further information on the Company’s corporate culture.\n​\nCompetitive Conditions\nCompetition for new residents is generally intense across our markets. Some competing communities offer amenities that our communities do not have. Competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors, including sub-market supply and \n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndemand. In addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do.\nWe believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:\n●\na fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise;\n●\nscalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet-based marketing efforts;\n●\naccess to diversified sources of capital;\n●\ngeographic diversification with a presence in 21 markets across the country; and\n●\nsignificant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert.\nMoving forward, we will continue to improve lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with metrics that impact our bottom-line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside.\nCommunities\nAt December 31, 2024, our consolidated real estate portfolio included 169 communities with a total of 55,696 completed apartment homes. The overall quality of our portfolio relative to other properties generally enables us to charge higher rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company was not developing any communities, although the Company was incurring and capitalizing costs directly related to predevelopment activities in preparation of future development commencements. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company completed the development of two communities located in Tampa, Florida and Addison, Texas, with a total of 415 apartment homes.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company \nhad no communities at which it was conducting substantial redevelopment activities\n.\nSame-Store Community Comparison\nWe believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our \nSame-Store Communities’\n NOI, which is total rental revenue, less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management. Our \nSame-Store Community\n population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $84.8 million as compared to $439.5 million in the prior year. The primary drivers for the decrease were lower gains from dispositions of real estate as we sold fewer assets in 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, and lower interest income and other income/(expense) primarily driven by a $37.3 million non-cash loan reserve partially offset by higher notes receivable balances. These were partially offset by higher total net operating income (“NOI”).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, our Same-Store NOI increased by $15.3 million compared to the prior year. Our \nSame-Store Community\n properties provided 92.4% of our total NOI for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in NOI for the 51,428 Same-Store apartment homes, or 92.3% of our portfolio, was primarily driven by an increase in market rental rates and an increase in reimbursement, ancillary and fee income, partially offset by higher personnel costs, higher repair and maintenance expense, higher utilities expense, higher administration and marketing costs, and higher real estate tax expense.\n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRevenue growth in 2025 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy, inclusive of economic conditions as a result of a recession, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.\nTax Matters\nUDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.\nWe may utilize our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) to engage in activities that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Our TRS generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes.\nInflation\nInflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and repair and maintenance costs. In addition, inflation could also impact our general and administrative expenses, the interest on our debt if variable or refinanced in a high-inflationary environment, our cost of capital, and our cost of development, redevelopment, maintenance or other operating activities. However, the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, which in an inflationary environment, and absent other factors such as increased supply, generally enables us to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an extreme or sustained escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this had a material impact on our results for the year ended December 31, 2024\n.\nEnvironmental Matters\nVarious environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party.\nTo date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.\nFederal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities.\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nInsurance\nWe carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability we believe to be customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability we believe to be customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage on a replacement cost basis, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.\nSupplemental U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\n​\nThe following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the prospectus dated February 14, 2023, contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on February 14, 2023. Capitalized terms herein that are not otherwise defined shall have the same meaning as when used in such disclosures.\n​\n●\nThe second bullet in the second paragraph under the heading “Taxation of UDR - Income Tests” is clarified to acknowledge an exception to the related party tenant test for a tenant that is a taxable REIT subsidiary and either (i) at least 90% of the total leased space of the property is leased to unrelated tenants and the rent paid by the taxable REIT subsidiary is substantially comparable to the rent paid by the unrelated tenants for comparable space, or (ii) the property leased to the taxable REIT subsidiary is a lodging facility or a health care facility and certain other requirements are satisfied.\n●\nT\nhe third prong of the definition of “hedging transaction” in the fourth paragraph under the heading “Taxation of UDR - Income Tests” is hereby clarified to establish that in order to qualify as a “hedging transaction” that will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests, a new transaction entered into to hedge the income or loss from prior hedging transactions where the property or indebtedness which was the subject of the prior hedging transaction was extinguished or disposed of must be clearly identified as specified in Treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into.\n●\nThe penultimate paragraph under the heading “Taxation of UDR - Asset Tests” is clarified to acknowledge that the cure provision for de minimis violations applies to violations of the 5% asset test as well.\n●\nThe second sentence of the third paragraph under the heading “Taxation of Stockholders - Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders - Capital Gains Dividends” and the entirety of the fourth paragraph under the heading “Taxation of Stockholders - Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders - Dispositions of UDR Stock” are hereby clarified to establish that the exemption from FIRPTA for a “qualified foreign pension fund” also may apply to a “qualified controlled entity,” but in each case only if the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity satisfies certain requirements to be a “qualified holder.” Moreover, Treasury regulations provide that a foreign partnership of which all of the interests are held by qualified holders, including through one or more partnerships, may certify its status as such and will generally not be treated as a non-U.S. person for purposes of withholding under FIRPTA.\n●\nThe second and third sentences of first paragraph under the heading “Taxation of Stockholders -Taxation of Tax-Exempt Stockholders” are hereby clarified to establish that dividend distributions from a REIT to a U.S. tax-exempt entity generally should not give rise to UBTI unless, (i) the tax-exempt entity hold its shares in the REIT as “debt-financed property,” or (ii) the tax-exempt entity is a “qualified trust” that holds more than 10% by value of the interests in the REIT and the REIT is a “pension-held REIT.” Additionally, income from the sale of our stock generally shall not give rise to UBTI unless the tax-exempt entity holds \n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\nour stock as (i) “debt-financed property” or (ii) inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.\n●\nThe second paragraph under the heading “Taxation of Stockholders - Taxation of Tax-Exempt Stockholders” is hereby revised to apply to just tax-exempt stockholders that are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under Sections 501(c) (7), (c)(9) and (c)(17) of the Code.\nAvailable Information\nWe file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

    "item1a": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS \nThere are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the Company, some of which are beyond its control. The following is a description of important factors that may cause the Company’s actual results in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this Report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. Forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. These risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur.\nRisks Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Our Operations\nUnfavorable Apartment Market and Economic Conditions Could Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels, Rental Revenues and the Value of Our Real Estate Assets.\n Unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate or unfavorable economic conditions generally, may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. Our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by increases in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, debt levels, housing markets, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. Our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline. We would expect that declines in our occupancy levels and rental and other revenues would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities. Factors that have in the past and may in the future affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others:\n●\ndownturns in global, national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment;\n●\ndeclines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing options more affordable;\n●\ngovernment or builder incentives with respect to home ownership, making alternative housing options more attractive;\n●\nlocal real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes;\n●\ndeclines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;\n●\nchanges in market rental rates;\n●\nour ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms;\n●\nthe timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations;\n●\nchanges in household formation; and\n●\nrent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating or impacting rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs or otherwise impact us.\nThe Geographic Concentration of Our Communities in Certain Markets Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Operations if a Particular Market is Adversely Impacted by Economic or Other Conditions. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 73.1% of our total NOI was generated from communities located in Metropolitan D.C. (15.4%), Boston, MA (11.7%), Orange County, CA (10.9%), the San Francisco Bay Area, CA (8.4%), Dallas, TX (8.3%), New York, NY (6.5%), Seattle, WA (6.2%) and Tampa, FL (5.7%). As a result, if any one or more of these markets is adversely impacted by regional or local economic conditions or real estate market conditions, including new supply, such \nconditions may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse. In addition, if one or more of these markets is adversely affected by changes in regional or local regulations, including those related to rent control or stabilization, such regulations may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Apartment Units as Leases Expire, or the Terms of Renewals or New Leases May Be Less Favorable Than Current Leases. \nWhen our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because their leases are not renewed or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. Even if leases are renewed or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable to us than the expiring lease terms. Furthermore, because the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition may be and have in the past been, adversely affected. If residents do not experience increases in their income or if they experience decreases in their income or job losses, we may be unable to increase or maintain rent and/or delinquencies may increase.\nWe Face Certain Risks Related to Our Retail and Commercial Space. \nCertain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties. The long-term nature of our retail and commercial leases (generally five to ten years with market-based or fixed-price renewal options) and the characteristics of many of our tenants (small and/or local businesses) may subject us to certain risks. The longer-term leases could result in below market lease rates over time, particularly in an inflationary environment. We may require guarantees and other credit support which may prove to be inadequate or uncollectable, and the failure rate of small and/or local businesses may be higher than average. We may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates. Also, when leases for our retail or commercial space terminate either at the end of the lease or because a tenant leaves early, the space may take, and spaces have taken in the past, longer than expected to relet, may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than the prior lease terms, or we may incur additional expenses related to modifications of the spaces in order to satisfy new tenants. Our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space. The presence of competitive alternatives may adversely affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. Our retail or commercial tenants may experience financial distress or bankruptcy, or may fail to comply with their contractual obligations, and may seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations, all of which has happened in the past and may occur again in the future, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n​\nWe Face Risks Related to Inflation/Deflation.\n Substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. The U.S. economy has during certain periods over the last few years experienced high rates of inflation, which has increased our operating expenses due to higher third party vendor costs and increased our interest expense due to higher interest rates on our variable rate debt. Although the short-term nature of our apartment leases may, absent other factors, enable us to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes, an extreme or sustained escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases. The general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt, general and administrative expenses, materials costs, labor costs, and other expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. \nWe Are Subject to Certain Risks Associated with Selling Apartment Communities, Which Could Limit Our Operational and Financial Flexibility.\n We periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions, among other factors, may make it difficult to sell apartment communities we own. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser or to close the sale of a property. Furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold or the purchase price may be reduced to cover any cost of correcting defects or making improvements. These conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio in order to meet our strategic objectives, which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or our ability to fund other activities in which we may want to engage such as the purchase of properties, development or redevelopment, or funding the Debt and Preferred Equity Program. We are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities, among others:\n●\na significant portion of the proceeds from some property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for such sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the “Code,” so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\nfederal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities or interests in communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable or when we may otherwise desire to sell.\nCompetition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease Apartment Homes or Increase or Maintain Rents.\n Our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in a particular area, including new supply, could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of Past or Future Acquisitions, and the Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel Successfully Could Create Inefficiencies.\n We have acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks, among others:\n●\nwe may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential acquisitions;\n●\nif we seek and are able to finance an acquisition with debt, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the debt used to finance the acquisition;\n●\neven if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may not complete the acquisition for a variety of reasons after incurring certain acquisition-related costs;\n●\nwe may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we subsequently do not complete;\n●\nwhen we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability;\n●\nthe expected occupancy rates, rental rates and expenses may differ from actual results; and\n●\nwe may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could materially and adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability.\nCompetition Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Acquire Properties. \nIn the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may limit attractive investment opportunities, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns.\nDevelopment and Construction Risks Could Impact Our Profitability.\n In the past we have pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. Development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. Our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks, among others:\n●\nif we seek construction financing we may be unable to obtain such financing for development activities on favorable terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments;\n●\nwe may experience supply chain constraints, which could result in increased development costs or delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community;\n●\nwe may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental or quasi-governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations;\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\ncosts may be higher or yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget, defaults by our counterparties, and/or higher than expected concessions for lease-up and lower rents than expected;\n●\nwe may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may be unable to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such development opportunities;\n●\nwe may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or we may incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs;\n●\noccupancy rates, rents and concessions at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our expected return on our investment and our overall profitability goals; and\n●\nwhen we sell communities or properties that we developed or renovated to third parties, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance.\nAn Epidemic, Pandemic or Other Health Crisis, and Measures Intended to Prevent the Spread of Such an Event, Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on our Business, Results of Operations, Cash Flows and Financial Condition. \nWe face risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, which in the past have impacted, and in the future could impact, the markets in which we operate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The impact of an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, and measures to prevent the spread of such an event, could materially and adversely affect our business in a number of ways. Our rental revenue and operating results depend significantly on the occupancy levels at our properties and the ability of our residents and retail and commercial tenants to meet their rent obligations to us, which have in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by, among other things, job losses, furloughs, store closures, lower incomes, uncertainty about the future as a result of an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis and related governmental actions such as eviction moratoriums, shelter-in-place orders, prohibitions or limits on charging certain fees, and limitations on collections and or rent increases. Such government actions have affected, and may again in the future affect, our ability to collect rent or enforce legal or contractual remedies for the failure to pay rent, which has in turn negatively impacted, and may in the future negatively impact, our ability to remove residents or retail and commercial tenants who are not paying rent and our ability to rent their units or other space to new residents or retail and commercial tenants, respectively. \n \n​\nState, local, and federal governments also have increased, and may in the future increase, property taxes or other taxes or fees, or may enact new taxes or fees, in order to increase revenue in connection with an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis or otherwise, which has in the past increased, and may in the future increase, our expenses. Our development and construction projects, including those in our Debt and Preferred Equity Program, also have been and could in the future be adversely affected by factors related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis. An epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, or related impacts thereof also could adversely affect the businesses and financial conditions of our counterparties, including our joint venture partners, participants in the Debt and Preferred Equity Program, and general contractors and their subcontractors, and their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and to complete transactions or projects with us as intended. \n​\nBankruptcy or Defaults of Our Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Our Performance. \nWe have relationships with and we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities, borrowers, or joint venture partners, among others. As a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties or their subcontractors have resulted in, and in the future could result in, services not being provided as expected, projects not being completed on time, on budget, or at all, or contractual obligations to us not being satisfied. Further, volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended. Either circumstance could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nProperty Ownership Through Partnerships and Joint Ventures May Limit Our Ability to Act Exclusively in Our Interest.\n We have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties through partnerships and joint ventures, including those in which we own a preferred interest or debt, with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. As of December 31, 2024, we had active unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships, including our preferred equity investments, with a total equity investment of $917.5 million. We have in the past, and could in the future, become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which could adversely impact us. Moreover, our partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our \n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nobjectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. In some instances, our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. Also, our partners have in the past failed and may in the future fail to make capital contributions when due and our partners or the project may otherwise not act or perform as expected, or the property may not be operated in the manner in which we would operate it, any of which may require us to contribute additional capital, acquire our partner’s interest or other property, or take other actions that may negatively impact the project or our return. In addition, we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. In general, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell or other similar arrangement, which arrangement or other factors could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner’s interest or other property, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner’s interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process and could cause us to recognize unanticipated capital gains or losses or the loss of fee income.\nWe may also be subject to other risks in connection with partnerships or joint ventures, including (i) a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions (which could result in litigation or disposing of an asset at a time at which we otherwise would not sell the asset), (ii) limitations on our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner, and (iii) requirements to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture.\nWe May Not be Permitted to Dispose of Certain Properties or Pay Down the Indebtedness Associated with Those Properties When We Might Otherwise Desire to Do so Without Incurring Additional Costs. \nIn connection with certain property acquisitions, we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers or dispose of the property in a transaction in which a gain is not recognized for federal income tax purposes by such sellers, and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions. These agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance. However, subject to certain conditions, we generally retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers.\nWe Could Incur Significant Insurance Costs and Some Potential Losses May Not Be Adequately Covered by Insurance Reserves.\n We have a comprehensive insurance program covering our properties and operating activities with limits of liability, deductibles and self-insured retentions that we believe are comparable to similarly situated companies, including within the multifamily industry. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses that may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. In addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage.\nIf an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the future revenue from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. Material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. If one or more of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Such events could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost of insuring our apartment communities and our operations is a component of expense. Insurance premiums and the terms and conditions of insurance policies are subject to significant fluctuations and changes, including recent increases in premiums, which are generally outside of our control. We insure our properties and our operations with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating and financial profile at the time our policies are put into effect. The financial condition of one or more insurance companies that insure us may be negatively impacted, which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. Their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. In addition, the failure, or exit or partial exit from an insurance market, of one or more insurance companies or other changes in insurance markets in general may affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage in the amounts that we seek, or at all, increase the costs to renew or replace our insurance policies, cause us to self-insure a larger portion of the risk, or increase the cost of insuring properties.\nFailure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our Growth.\n We have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if opportunities we believe are appropriate arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing \n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmarkets. Entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. These risks include, among others:\n●\ninability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies;\n●\ninability to hire and retain key personnel;\n●\nlack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and\n●\ninability to achieve budgeted financial results.\nFailure to Succeed with New Initiatives May Limit Our Ability to Grow NOI\n. We have in the past developed and may in the future develop initiatives or processes that are intended to drive operating efficiencies and grow NOI, including smart home technologies and self-service options that are accessible to residents through smart devices or otherwise. Such initiatives in the past have involved and in the future may involve our associates having new or different responsibilities and processes. We may incur significant costs and divert resources in connection with such initiatives or processes, and these initiatives or processes may not perform as projected, which could adversely affect our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\n​\nPotential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could Result in Substantial Costs.\n Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. In addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination or we could be required to incur additional costs to change how the property is constructed or operated due to presence of such substances. These costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property.\nIn addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. Noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. Changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. For example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or ACM, or other hazardous substances. Environmental, health and safety laws require that ACM and other hazardous substances be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements.\nThese requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if ACM would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. In addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to ACM or other hazardous substances or releases of ACM or other hazardous substances into the environment.\nWe cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental or building condition issues will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Properties May Contain or Develop Harmful Mold or Suffer from Other Indoor Air Quality Issues, Which Could Lead to Liability for Adverse Health Effects or Property Damage or Cost for Remediation.\n When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. \n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others for property damage or personal injury.\nCompliance or Failure to Comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or Other Safety Regulations and Requirements Could Result in Substantial Costs.\n The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the “Americans with Disabilities Act”) generally requires that public buildings, including our properties and other public facing functions related to our business, including our website, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. Claims have been asserted, and in the future claims may be asserted, against us with respect to some of our properties or operations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties or otherwise related to our operations, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if claims arise, we may expend resources and incur costs in investigating and resolving such claims even if we or our property was in compliance with the law.\nOur properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements and federal, state and local accessibility requirements in addition to those imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Adoption of, or Changes to, Rent Control, Rent Stabilization, Eviction, Tenants’ Rights and Similar Laws and Regulations in Our Markets Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Results of Operations and Property Values. \nVarious state and local governments as well as the federal government have enacted and may continue to enact rent control, rent stabilization, or limitations, and similar laws, regulations and policies, including laws or court orders, that could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees which could have a retroactive effect. For example, in June 2019, the State of New York enacted new rent control regulations known as the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, in October of 2019, the State of California enacted the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, and in September 2024, the City of Salinas California, passed a rent stabilization ordinance. In some cases the increases in rents allowed by such regulations may not offset increases in expenses, whether such increases in expenses are due to inflation or otherwise. We have seen a recent increase in governments enacting or considering, or being urged to consider, such laws and regulations. Federal, state and local governments or courts also have made, and may make in the future, changes to laws related to allowable fees and rents, eviction and other tenants’ rights laws and regulations (including changes that apply retroactively) that could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our properties. Laws and regulations regarding rent control, rent stabilization, eviction, tenants’ rights, allowable fees, and other matters, as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such laws and regulations, may limit our ability to charge market rents, increase rents, evict delinquent tenants or charge fees, or recover increases in our operating expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of our properties. In addition, the increases in regulations applicable to our business in general may increase our costs of compliance and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. \nCompliance with or Changes in Real Estate Tax and Other Laws and Regulations Could Adversely Affect Our Funds from Operations and Our Ability to Make Distributions to Stockholders.\n We are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances at locations where we operate regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. Generally, we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes to tenants under leases. These costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, (ii) laws and regulations regulating housing, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, or (iii) employment related laws, among others, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change may result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and also may require us to spend more on our new development communities \n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nwithout a corresponding increase in revenue. In addition, existing laws could be interpreted in a manner that restricts our ability to use systems that we currently use in our operations and we may face litigation or regulatory risk in connection with such laws. Future compliance with new laws of general applicability, laws applicable to companies in our industry, or laws applicable to public companies generally could increase our costs and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. \nRisk of Litigation\n. From time to time, we are, and would expect to be in the future, involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims with respect to our properties or operations. For example, we are currently a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit and lawsuits filed by the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland involving RealPage, which is one of our vendors.\n \nAn unfavorable resolution of any litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, being involved in litigation, whether the result is favorable or unfavorable, could negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, litigation, whether the result is favorable or unfavorable, has in the past and may in the future result in substantial costs and expenses and could significantly divert the attention of management.\nRisk of Damage from Catastrophic Weather and Natural Events.\n Our communities are located in areas that have experienced, and in the future may experience, catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, deep freezes, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. These adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk of Potential Climate Change\n. To the extent significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located occur, we may experience extreme weather conditions and changes in precipitation and temperature or water levels, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas or communities that are otherwise affected by these changes. Should the impact of such climate changes be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisk of Earthquake Damage. \nSome of our communities are located in areas subject to earthquakes, including in the general vicinity of earthquake faults. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. We may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. As a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical.\nRisk of Accidental Death or Injury Due to Fire, Natural Disasters or Other Hazards. \nThe accidental death or injury of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters, other hazards, or acts or omissions of third parties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nActual or Threatened Terrorist Attacks and Other Acts of Violence, Destruction or War May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business and Operating Results and Could Decrease the Value of Our Assets.\n Actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, destruction or war could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Attacks or other similar actions that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. Further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack or similar events. In addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMezzanine Loan or Other Loan Assets Involve Greater Risks of Loss than Senior Loans Secured by Income-Producing Properties. \nWe have originated in the past and may in the future originate mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property, which may be under development, or subordinated loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property, which may \n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbe under development, or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property, which may be under development, or loans that are not secured. Mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than a senior mortgage secured by real property, because the security for the loan may lose all or substantially all of its value as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. Unsecured loans involve higher risk by virtue of being unsecured. In the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. If a borrower defaults on our loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine or other loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. As a result, we may not recover some of or all our investment. In addition, mezzanine loans typically have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. Further, foreclosing on our security interest may be delayed or otherwise impacted by the existence of the senior loan, the senior lender’s decision regarding whether to enforce its remedies, or the timing of the senior lender’s foreclosure or enforcement of other remedies with respect to such loan. If there is a default on the senior debt or an inability to refinance the senior debt, we may contribute additional capital or take other actions that we would not otherwise pursue absent such default or failure. In addition, in the event of a default or other changes in the circumstances of an investment, including a change in the value of the applicable property, we may be, and have been in the past, required to change the manner in which the investment is accounted for, including our ability to recognize earnings, or to recognize an allowance for loan loss or a loss on consolidation.\nRisk Related to Preferred Equity Investments. \nWe have made in the past and may in the future make preferred equity investments in corporations, limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of directly or indirectly acquiring, developing and/or managing real property. Generally, we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity, and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors, managers, general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations. Although we have sought and would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives, our partners may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent that are inconsistent with our interests. Further, if our partners were to fail to invest additional capital in the entity when required, which has happened in the past, or otherwise do not perform as expected, we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment. Our partners have in the past failed, and may in the future fail, to develop or operate the real property, operate the entity, refinance property indebtedness or sell the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest or at all. Further, the entity may need to refinance third-party debt on terms that are inconsistent with our interests or are terms on which we would not elect to incur debt, or the entity may default on third-party debt. To the extent the entity defaults on third-party debt or is unable to refinance such debt or a portion thereof, we may acquire such debt or otherwise take action, including contributing additional capital, to protect our position that we would not take absent the default or inability to refinance. Such activities have in the past involved and may in the future involve foreclosing on the security interest in the property secured by such debt, seeking a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or similar remedy or removing our partner, and such activities may involve costs or delays or create other risks, including the risk of claims from our partners. In the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations, defaults on its debt, or becomes insolvent or the investment or the underlying property otherwise does not perform as expected, we may lose all or part of our investment in the entity, be delayed in recovering our investment or the expected returns or directly or indirectly take over the property or the management thereof at a time at which we would not done so absent the failure to meet expectations or the default. In addition, in the event of a default or other changes in the circumstances of an investment, including a change in the value of the applicable property, we may be, and have been in the past, required to change the manner in which the investment is accounted for, including our ability to recognize earnings, or recognize an impairment or a loss on consolidation.\nRisks Related to Ground Leases. \nWe have entered into in the past and may in the future enter into, as either landlord or tenant, a long-term ground lease with respect to a property or a portion thereof. Such ground leases may contain a rent reset provision that requires both parties to agree to a new rent or is based upon factors, for example fair market rent, that are not objective and are not within our control. We may not be able to agree with the counterparty to a revised rental rate, or the revised rental rate may be set by external factors, which could result in a different rental rate than we forecasted. In the past we have had disagreements with respect to revised rental rates and certain of such disagreements have gone to arbitration (for resolution as provided in the applicable lease agreement) and have been resolved in a manner adverse to us. In addition, the other party may not perform as expected under the ground lease or there may be a dispute with the other party to the ground lease. Any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe May Experience a Decline in the Fair Value of Our Assets and Be Forced to Recognize Impairment Charges, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Financial Condition, Liquidity and Results of Operations and the Market Price of Our Common Stock.\n A decline in the fair value of our assets may require us, and has in the past required us, to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the United States (“GAAP”) if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. If we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nAny Material Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Market Price of Our Common Stock.\n Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we have one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nA Breach of Information Technology Systems On Which We Rely Could Materially and Adversely Impact Our Business, Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Reputation.\n We rely on information technology systems, including the internet and networks and systems and software developed, maintained and controlled by third party vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes. Third party vendors may collect and hold personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our tenants, prospective tenants and employees. We also maintain such information and financial and business information regarding us and persons and entities with which we do business on our information technology systems. While we take steps, and generally require third party vendors to take steps, to protect the security of the information maintained in our and third party vendors’ information technology systems, including associate training and testing and the use of commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing of the information, it is possible that our or our third party vendors’ security measures will not be able to prevent human error or the systems’ or software’s improper functioning, or the loss, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of personally identifiable information or other confidential or sensitive information, including information about our tenants and employees. Cybersecurity breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware, phishing scams, attacks by hackers, breaches due to employee error or misconduct, and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized access to information maintained on our information technology systems or the information technology systems of our third party vendors or other third parties or otherwise cause disruption or negative impacts to occur to our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cybersecurity breaches, there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cybersecurity breach or other occurrence or that such insurance will continue to be available at rates that we consider reasonable or at all. We have in the past experienced cybersecurity breaches on our information technology systems or relating to software or third party vendor systems that we utilize, and, while none to date have been material to us, we expect such breaches may occur in the future. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems become more varied and sophisticated and the occurrence of such breaches becomes more frequent, we and our third party vendors and other third parties may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques or breaches or implement appropriate preventative measures. Any failure to prevent cybersecurity breaches and maintain the proper function, security and availability of our or our third party vendors’ and other third parties’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation and brand, damage our competitive position, make it difficult for us to attract and retain residents or other tenants, and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur Business and Operations Would Suffer in the Event of Information Technology System Failures.\n Despite system redundancy and the existence of disaster recovery plans for our information technology systems, our information technology systems and the information technology systems maintained by our third party vendors are vulnerable to damage arising from any number of sources beyond our or our third party vendors’ control, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. Any failure to maintain proper function and availability of our or third parties’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA Failure to Keep Pace with Developments in Technology Could Impair our Operations or Competitive Position.\n Our business continues and will continue to demand the use of sophisticated systems, software and technology, including artificial intelligence. These systems, software and technologies must be refined, updated and replaced on a regular basis in order for us to meet our business requirements, our residents’ demands and expectations, and regulatory requirements. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or at a reasonable cost, or fail to do so, our business could suffer. Also, we may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system, software or technology, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could adversely affect our results of operations.    \nSocial Media Presents Risks. \nThe use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure. Negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation. Further, employees or others may disclose non-public information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As social media evolves, we will be presented with new risks and challenges.\nOur Success Depends on Our Senior Management.\n Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. We may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. Accounting Standards May Materially and Adversely Affect Our Reported Results of Operations. \nAccounting for public companies in the United States is in accordance with GAAP, which is established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the SEC as authoritative for publicly held companies. Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the FASB and the SEC, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for U.S. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements.\nThird-Party Expectations Relating to Environmental, Social and Governance Factors May Impose Additional Costs and Expose Us to New Risks\n. There is a focus from certain investors, tenants, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance factors. In addition, there has been increased focus on such matters by various regulatory authorities, including the SEC and the state of California and other states or jurisdictions, and the activities and expense required to comply with new laws, regulations or standards may be significant. Some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. Third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased in number, resulting in varied and in some cases inconsistent standards. In addition, the criteria by which companies’ corporate responsibility practices are assessed and the regulations applicable thereto are evolving, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives or activities to satisfy such new criteria or regulations. Further, if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific third-party provider or investor, some investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. Furthermore, if our competitors’ corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest in our competitors instead. In addition, we have communicated certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental, social and governance matters, and we may in the future communicate revised or additional initiatives or goals. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. In addition, certain locations have enacted and others may in the future enact sustainability regulations pertaining to buildings, including \n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nexisting buildings. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, tenants and other stakeholders, our initiatives are not executed as planned, we are unable to comply with regulations or we do not satisfy our goals, our reputation and financial results could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financings\nChanging Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and Adversely Affect Our Cash Flows and the Market Price of Our Common Stock.\n We currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt, including unsecured commercial paper, at rates that vary with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $501.3 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 8.6% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date, and we have from time to time experienced increases in the interest rates on such indebtedness, which has increased our interest expense and adversely impacted our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, as a result of higher interest rates, the costs of hedging transactions have increased significantly and may continue to increase. Continued increases in interest rates would further increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt, including unsecured commercial paper. The effect of any prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to service our indebtedness, make distributions to security holders, make acquisitions and develop properties. \nInsufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and Create Refinancing Risk.\n We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, could restrict or limit our ability to incur additional debt, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required debt payments and satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, the amounts under our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. We are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressure to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. In addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nFailure to Generate Sufficient Income Could Impair Debt Service Payments and Distributions to Stockholders.\n If our apartment communities do not generate sufficient revenue to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt and to pay dividends or distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may affect the income generated by our apartment communities:\n●\nthe national and local economies;\n●\nlocal real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply or increasing supply of apartment homes;\n●\ntenants’ or prospective tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located;\n●\nour ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance;\n●\nrental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities;\n●\ncompetition from other apartment communities or alternative housing options;\n●\nchanges in interest rates and the availability of financing;\n●\nchanges in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and\n●\nchanges in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing.\nExpenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance, labor costs and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenue from that community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.\n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur Debt Level May Be Increased.\n Our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.\nFinancing May Not Be Available and Could Be Dilutive.\n Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit, construction loans and other forms of secured debt, commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. We and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time, including due to disruptions and uncertainty in the equity and credit markets and regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets, for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the Basel III capital requirements and the associated “High Volatility Commercial Real Estate” designation, which has adversely impacted the availability of loans, including construction loans, and the proceeds of and the interest rates thereon. Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. If we issue additional equity securities, including under our ATM program, instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted.\nFailure To Maintain Our Current Credit Ratings Could Adversely Affect Our Cost of Funds, Related Margins, Liquidity, and Access to Capital Markets.\n Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt, commercial paper program and preferred stock. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flows and earnings. Due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets, including our ability to access the commercial paper market.\nDisruptions in Financial Markets May Adversely Impact the Availability and Cost of Credit and Have Other Adverse Effects on Us and the Market Price of Our Common Stock.\n Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. \nThe global equity and credit markets have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, periods of extraordinary turmoil and volatility. \nThese circumstances may materially and adversely impact liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive or in some cases unavailable. Disruptions and uncertainty in the equity and credit markets, including as a result of bank failures and uncertainty in the banking sector generally, may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of our common stock. \nWe also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility and other credit facilities. If these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility. \nIf we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. A prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. These events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common or preferred stock.\nA Change in U.S. Government Policy or Support Regarding Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Business. \nWhile in recent years we have decreased our borrowings from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing markets including potential purchasers of our properties. Potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the U.S. have been, and may in the future be, suggested that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are able to provide, limitations on the loans that the agencies may make, which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties, or the phase out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Should Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac discontinue providing liquidity to our sector, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally, it may adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and, as a result, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Soundness of Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us.\n We have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions or counterparties or could lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Disruptions and uncertainty with respect to financial institutions, including as a result of bank failures and liquidity concerns, may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects our financial institutions or other counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nInterest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May Result in Material Charges.\n From time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. If the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. In addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.\nRisks Related to Tax Laws\nWe Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if We Failed to Qualify as a REIT.\n We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. Our qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We intend that our current organization and method of operation will enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. In addition, U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or adversely affect our stockholders.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. Also, unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a REIT. The additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as REITs under the Code, and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year.\nDividends Paid by REITs Generally Do Not Qualify for Reduced Tax Rates.\n In general, qualified dividends paid to individual U.S. stockholders are eligible for a reduced 20% U.S. federal income tax rate. However, unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a REIT, our regular dividends (i.e., dividends other than capital gain dividends) paid to individual U.S. stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates on qualified dividends and are instead taxed at ordinary income rates. However, individual U.S. stockholders generally may deduct 20% of our regular \n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndividends under Section 199A of the Code, reducing the effective tax rate applicable to such dividends (although such provision will expire after December 31, 2025 absent future legislation).\nWe Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable REIT Subsidiaries, Which Are Subject to Certain Tax Risks.\n We have established or invested in and conduct a portion of our business through taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite our qualification as a REIT, taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. In addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in taxable REIT subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for certain of these tests. While we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with taxable REIT subsidiaries will not adversely affect our REIT qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax or taxable REIT subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with taxable REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected.\nREIT Distribution Requirements Limit Our Available Cash.\n As a REIT, we are subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code. However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash and/or nondeductible expenditures, could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code. To the extent we distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our net REIT taxable income we will be subject to tax at regular corporate tax rates on the retained portion.\nCertain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain Attributable to the Transaction.\n From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. If the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nChanges to the U.S. Federal Income Tax Laws, including the Enactment of Certain Tax Reform Measures, Could Have an Adverse Impact on Our Business and Financial Results. \nIn recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate and REITs, and it is possible that additional legislation may be enacted in the future. There can be no assurance that future changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws or regulatory changes will not be proposed or enacted that could impact our business and financial results. The REIT rules are regularly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department, which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes. If enacted, certain of such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe cannot predict whether, when or to what extent any new U.S. federal income tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will impact the real estate investment industry or REITs. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential future changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws on an investment in our shares.\nWe May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in State and Local Tax Laws and May Become Subject to Tax Audits from Time to Time.\n Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income tax, but we are subject to certain state and local tax. From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and local jurisdictions in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to our stockholders. In the normal course of business, we or our affiliates (including entities through which we own real estate) may also become subject to federal, \n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nstate or local tax audits. If we (or such entities) become subject to federal, state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership Intend to Qualify as Partnerships, but Cannot Guarantee That They Will Qualify.\n The Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes, and we intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes. If classified as partnerships, the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability. However, the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were “publicly traded partnerships,” unless at least 90% of their income was qualifying income as defined in the Code. A “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). Although neither the Operating Partnership’s nor the DownREIT Partnership’s partnership units are traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption rights of their limited partners, the Operating Partnership’s and DownREIT Partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations. Qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. The income requirements applicable to REITs and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. The Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. If either the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, such partnership would incur substantial tax liabilities, and we would then fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. In addition, even if the 90% test were met if the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership were a publicly traded partnership, there could be adverse tax impacts for certain limited partners.\nQualifying as a REIT Involves Highly Technical and Complex Provisions of the Code.\n Our qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the REIT income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. In addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Ownership of Our Stock\nChanges in Market Conditions and Volatility of Stock Prices Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common Stock.\n The stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), on which we list our common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our common stock has been, and in the future could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition to the risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of our common stock, including:\n●\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n●\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends or our payment of dividends in shares of our stock;\n●\nchanges in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;\n●\ndifficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt;\n●\ndecreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations;\n●\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\npublication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;\n●\nthe general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies);\n●\ngeneral stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;\n●\na change in analyst ratings;\n●\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n●\nadverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;\n●\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n●\nterrorist activity, geopolitical events or armed conflicts (including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the military conflict in Israel and Gaza), which may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending;\n●\nfailure to qualify as a REIT;\n●\nstrategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n●\nfailure to satisfy listing requirements of the NYSE;\n●\ngovernmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and\n●\nthe issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under our at-the-market equity distribution program.\nMany of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.\nWe May Change the Dividend Policy for Our Common Stock in the Future.\n The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. Any change in our dividend policy could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nMaryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in Our Stockholders\n’\n Best Interests.\n Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to various Maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our Company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests. The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote.\nLimitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability of Our Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company Restrict the Transferability of Our Stock and May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to Our Stockholders.\n One of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, \n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nincluding entities specified in the Code, during the last half of any taxable year. Our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other REIT ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten our REIT status. These restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. Absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of our stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the Code for REITs, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. These provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’ best interests\n.",

    "item1c": "Item 1C. Cybersecurity \nGiven the prevalence of cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity represents a critical component of the Company’s overall approach to risk management. The Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards and practices are \nintegrated\n into the Company’s enterprise risk management (“ERM”) approach, and cybersecurity risks are among the core enterprise risks that are subject to oversight by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards and practices are derived from recognized frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) and other applicable industry standards, and the Company is working to obtain NIST certification. Many members of the Company’s cybersecurity team are certified by and have received training from the International Information Security Consortium (“IISC”). The Company generally approaches cybersecurity threats through a cross-functional, multilayered approach, with specific the goals of: (i) identifying, attempting to prevent and mitigating cybersecurity threats to the Company; (ii) preserving the confidentiality, security and availability of the information that we collect and store to use in our business; (iii) protecting the Company’s intellectual property; (iv) protecting personally identifiable data and maintaining the confidence of our customers, clients and business partners; and (v) providing appropriate public disclosure of cybersecurity risks and incidents when required.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nConsistent with overall ERM policies and practices, the Company’s cybersecurity program focuses on the following areas:\n●\nVigilance:\n The Company operates cybersecurity threat functions 24/7 with the specific goal of identifying, attempting to prevent and mitigating cybersecurity threats and responding to cybersecurity incidents in accordance with our established incident response and recovery plans.\n●\nSystems Safeguards:\n The Company deploys systems safeguards that are designed to protect the Company’s information systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality and access controls, which are evaluated and improved through ongoing vulnerability assessments and cybersecurity threat intelligence.\n●\nCollaboration:\n The Company utilizes collaboration mechanisms established with public and private entities, including intelligence and enforcement agencies, industry\n \ngroups and third-party service providers, to identify, assess and respond to cybersecurity risks.\n●\nThird-Party Risk Management:\n The Company maintains a risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing cybersecurity risks presented by \nthird parties\n, including vendors, service providers and other external users of the Company’s systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems. Third-party vendors are \nassessed\n against a standardized vendor risk assessment process before being engaged and the Company requests vendors to \n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nannually recertify that their security controls comply with established industry standards and applicable legal requirements.\n●\nInsider Threat Management:\n In order to try to mitigate cybersecurity threats to our systems, the Company attempts to provide associates with the minimum access to our systems required in order for a given associate to perform his or her assigned duties. We also perform reviews of access to both our administrative and financial systems as part of our annual compliance procedures, and, when duties and resources allow, rotate job responsibilities.\n●\nTraining: \nUpon employment and at least annually thereafter the Company provides mandatory training for our associates regarding cybersecurity threats, which reinforces the Company’s information security policies, standards and practices, and such training is scaled to reflect the roles, responsibilities, and information systems access of such personnel. The Company’s cybersecurity team performs regular phishing tests for associates and provides remedial training for associates who fail such tests. In addition, members of our cybersecurity team received specialized cybersecurity training.\n●\nIncident Response and Recovery Planning: \nThe Company has established and maintains incident response and recovery plans that address the Company’s response to a cybersecurity incident and the recovery from a cybersecurity incident, and such plans are assessed and evaluated on a regular basis. All meaningful cybersecurity incidents are reported to the Company’s legal department by our cybersecurity team.\n●\nGovernance, Communication, Coordination and Disclosure: \nThe Company utilizes a cross-functional approach to address the risk from cybersecurity threats, involving management personnel from the Company’s technology, operations, legal, risk management, internal audit and other key business functions, third-party vendors and consultants, as well as the members of the Board and the Audit and Risk Management Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”) in an ongoing dialogue regarding cybersecurity threats and incidents, while also implementing controls and procedures for the escalation of cybersecurity incidents when appropriate so that decisions regarding the disclosure and reporting of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner. Our Senior Vice President – Chief Technology Officer reports on our cybersecurity posture to the Audit Committee quarterly and the Board is updated at least annually.\nA key part of the Company’s strategy for managing risks from cybersecurity threats is the ongoing assessment and testing of the Company’s processes and practices through auditing, assessments, tabletop exercises, vulnerability testing and other exercises focused on evaluating the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures. The Company engages third parties, including legal counsel, to perform assessments on our cybersecurity measures, including information security maturity assessments, penetration testing inclusive of our resident facing apps and devices, audits and independent reviews of our information security control environment and operating effectiveness. The material results of such assessments, audits and reviews are reported to the Audit Committee and the Board, and the Company adapts its cybersecurity policies, standards, processes, and practices as necessary based on the information provided by the assessments, audits, and reviews.\n \nIn addition, in 2024 and 2023, outside legal counsel conducted an exercise regarding preparation for cyber events attended by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Investment Officer and Chief Financial Officer and other members of senior management.\nGovernance\nThe Board, in coordination with the Audit Committee\n, oversees the management of risks from cybersecurity threats, including the policies, standards, processes and practices that the Company’s management implements to address risks from cybersecurity threats. \nThe Board and the Audit Committee each receive presentations and reports on cybersecurity risks, which address a wide range of topics including, for example, recent developments, evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, third-party and independent reviews, the threat environment, new tools and vendors being used by the Company related to cybersecurity, technological trends and information security considerations arising with respect to the Company’s peers and third parties. The Board and the Audit Committee also receive information regarding any cybersecurity incident when appropriate, as well as ongoing updates regarding such incident until it has been addressed. At least once each year the Board and the Audit Committee at least quarterly discuss the Company’s approach to cybersecurity risk management with the Company’s Chief Technology Officer.\nThe Company’s Chief Technology Officer is the member of the Company’s management that is principally \nresponsible\n for overseeing the Company’s cybersecurity risk management program, in partnership with other business \n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nleaders across the Company. \nThe Chief Technology Officer and our Vice President, Information Security work in coordination with the other members of the Information Security Management System Committee (“ISMS”), which includes department heads and IT personnel.\n The Chief Technology Officer also provides monthly reports regarding information technology including cybersecurity to our senior management including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Investment Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Senior Vice President – Chief Accounting Officer, Senior Vice President – Investments, and Senior Vice President – General Counsel. \nThe Company’s Chief Technology Officer has served in various roles in information technology and information security for over 24 years. The Chief Technology Officer holds an undergraduate degree in computer science and a master’s degree in business administration. The Company’s Vice President, Information Security holds an undergraduate degree in computer science and management science, has attained a professional certification of Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) from the IISC and has served in various roles in information technology and information security for over 15 years. In addition, our Vice President, Information Security is a member of InfraGard.\n \nThe Company’s Chief Technology Officer and Vice President, Information Security, in coordination with the ISMS, work collaboratively across the Company to implement a program designed to protect the Company’s information systems from cybersecurity threats and to promptly respond to any cybersecurity incidents. To facilitate the success of this program, our IT security team and, when necessary, multidisciplinary teams throughout the Company are deployed to address cybersecurity threats and to respond to cybersecurity incidents in accordance with the Company’s incident response and recovery plans. Through the ongoing communications from these teams, the Chief Technology Officer and the Vice President, Information Security monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, and \nreport\n such incidents to the ISMS and other members of management and the Audit Committee or the Board when appropriate.\nTo date, the Company has \nno\nt been materially affected by a cybersecurity incident or cybersecurity threat and no incident has occurred that is reasonably likely to affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents"
