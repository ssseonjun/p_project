  "item1_summary": " Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties . Future revenue growth depends on the growth of supply and demand for listings on our platform and the development and adoption of new offerings and initiatives . A softening of supply or demand for our current or future offerings, whether caused by events outside of our control, challenging macroeconomic and political conditions, changes in host and guest preferences, public health crises such as pandemics, may result in decreased revenue .\n Our business success is heavily reliant on both hosts and guests engaging with our platform . Hosts must maintain and enhance their listings by offering a variety of desirable, competitively priced, and high-quality stays and experiences . If hosts fail to meet expectations, or if they choose to cross-list or list exclusively with competitors, our revenue and business operations could be adversely affected .\n Our new offerings and initiatives have a high degree of risk, as they may involve unproven businesses with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience . There can be no assurance that our hosts and guests will adopt or respond positively to such offerings . Our growth relies on delivering high-quality support to our community, which requires significant investment in staffing, technology, infrastructure, and training .\n 58% of our revenue was generated from listings outside of the United States . We expect to continue to make investments to expand our international operations . Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming, and expensive, and requires significant management attention and careful prioritization . The cost of maintaining robust community support is expected to rise, and efforts to reduce support requests may not offset these costs .\n We are vulnerable to changes in search engine algorithms and consumer behavior, which can reduce our platform's prominence . If we cannot effectively grow traffic without increasing performance marketing, our results of operations could be affected . If major platforms like Google or Apple favor their own services, our ability to engage users via mobile app or search could be impacted .\n Host, guest, or third-party actions that are criminal, violent, inappropriate, dangerous, or fraudulent may undermine the safety or perception of safety on our platform . Incidents involving alleged fatalities, injuries, sexual violence, fraud, privacy invasion, property damage, and discrimination have occurred and may occur in the future, potentially leading to legal liabilities and reputational damage .\n We have faced civil litigation, regulatory investigations, and inquiries involving allegations related to unsafe listings, discriminatory practices, and other misconduct . Despite efforts to enhance trust and safety, we may not fully succeed, impacting public perception and platform adoption . We have not in the past and may in the future undertake to independently verify the location, safety, or suitability of experiences for individual guests .\n We have obtained some third-party insurance, which is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to bookings on our platform . As we expand our offerings, or if the quantity or severity of incidents increases, our insurance rates and our financial exposure will grow, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition .\n Our internal systems have limitations, and changes in tracking methods could lead to unexpected metric variations . Errors in these systems may result in inaccurate data reporting . Inaccurate metrics or perceptions of inaccuracy could harm our reputation, affect our stock price, lead to litigation, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition .\n When a guest books and pays for a stay or experience on our platform, we hold the total amount the guest has paid until check-in, at which time we recognize our service fee as revenue . In certain jurisdictions, we are required to either safeguard customer funds in bankruptcy-remote bank accounts, or hold such funds in eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in such jurisdictions, equal to 100% of the aggregate amount held on behalf of customers .\n Airbnb uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to manage the exposures related to our business operations . Insurance coverage afforded by or available from our insurers may be inadequate for the needs of our business . Losses under our damage protection program could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition .\n Our costs for obtaining insurance policies will continue to increase as our business grows and continues to evolve . Increased frequency and severity and increased fraud could result in greater payouts, increased investigation costs, premium increases, and/or difficulty securing insurance coverage . We may experience difficulty in obtaining insurance coverage for new and evolving offerings, which could require us to incur greater costs .\n If these providers become unable or unwilling to offer services on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be disrupted . Transitioning to new providers would demand significant resources and might not be well-received by users . Software and services from these providers may fail to meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages .\n Credit card transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through debit cards . Any material increase in interchange fees in the United States or other geographies could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and other investments, with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad .\n In March 2021, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 . In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses and be required to make payments to hosts and/or refunds to guests out of our own funds .\n On October 31, 2022, we entered into a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with $1.0 billion of initial commitments from a group of lenders . As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility . We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs . Our ability to make payments under or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance .\n The failure to successfully execute and integrate acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . We have acquired multiple businesses and we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions . We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, which indebtedness could result in restrictions on our business and significant use of available cash to make payments of interest and principal .\n Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in integrating and managing the combined operations, technology platforms, or offerings of the acquired companies . Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . We may not be successful in integrating acquisitions, or the businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect .\n The failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies . The accounting for our business is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model . To the extent our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we have recognized an expense to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value .\n It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles and accounting policies over financial reporting . Adoption of a change in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the adoption of such change . Our founders and other members of our senior management team, as well as other employees, may terminate their employment with us at any time .\n In 2022, we adopted our Live and Work Anywhere policy, which permits the majority of our employees to work remotely . Remote working subjects us to operational challenges and risks . The increase in remote working could have adverse tax implications, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . We are also exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote workers, including compliance with local laws and regulations .\n Our transition to full or predominantly remote work environments presents significant challenges to maintaining compliance with country and state requirements . Foreign tax authorities may assert that certain of our entities have created permanent establishment in their countries, which could result in additional corporate income taxes and employee payroll withholding obligations . Our financial performance is dependent on the strength of the travel and hospitality industries, which can be significantly impacted by events beyond our control .\n Hosts have numerous options for listing their spaces and experiences, both online and offline, and often cross-list their offerings . We compete for hosts based on factors like booking volume, platform usability, service fees, host protections, and brand and reputation . Future downturns could similarly decrease demand for our platform, leading to lower bookings, increased cancellations, and reduced revenue .\n Our competitors include OTAs, search engines, listing and meta-search websites, hotel chains, property management companies, and online experience platforms . Many competitors have advantages such as greater brand recognition, larger marketing budgets, and more resources . Failure to offer or deploy new technologies as effectively as our competitors could adversely affect our business .\n Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of certain such events, as well as contribute to chronic changes that may also impact the behaviors of guests and hosts . Growing awareness of climate and other environmental or social pressures, including over-tourism, has also prompted responses by various actors in society, which may adversely impact the travel and hospitality industries .\n Our results of operations can vary significantly and are not necessarily indicative of future performance due to seasonal fluctuations and other factors . Revenue is recognized upon check-in, and as our business evolves, seasonal trends may change . Other factors include reduced travel and cancellations due to health concerns, natural disasters, wars, political instability, regional hostilities or law enforcement demands, and other regulatory actions .\n A significant portion of our bookings and revenue are denominated in foreign currencies, and our financial results are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates . A strong U.S. dollar can negatively impact our revenue, as approximately 54% of our revenue in 2024 was in non-U.S.-dollar currencies . We use a foreign exchange cash flow hedging program to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations .\n Airbnb is subject to evolving global tax regimes, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition . The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax and an excise tax on stock repurchases in the year ended December 31, 2024 . In December 2023, without admitting any liability, Airbnb Ireland signed an agreement with the Italian Revenue Agency in settlement of the 2017-2021 audit periods for an aggregate payment of $621 million .\n Airbnb’s subsidiary in Italy and Airbnb Ireland continue to be, or could in the future be, subject to tax audits in Italy . Such audits could result in the imposition of additional potentially significant prior and future tax obligations . The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD) is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies .\n The tax laws applicable to our business, including those of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation . Certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Airbnb . The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate .\n In January 2022, we entered into an administrative dispute process with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals . An acceptable outcome was not reached with IRS Appeals, and in May 2024, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency from the IRS related to the aforementioned valuation of our international intellectual property . The Notice claims that we owe $1.3 billion in tax, plus penalties and interest . We will continue to pursue all available remedies to resolve this dispute .\n New or revised tax laws could increase our tax liabilities and operational costs, potentially leading to penalties for non-compliance . Application of indirect taxes to e-commerce activities such as ours and to our hosts or guests is a complex and evolving issue . These taxes could raise costs for hosts and guests, discourage platform use, and reduce revenue .\n There is a risk that some of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits could expire unused . If a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders over a three-year period .\n Hosts list, and guests search for, stays and experiences on our platform in more than 220 countries and regions across the globe . There are national, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations in jurisdictions that relate to or affect our business . These regulations may expose our users or us to regulatory inquiries, litigation, and/or other disputes .\n Compliance with diverse and evolving laws across jurisdictions is costly and complex, increasing our operational expenses and potential liabilities . Environmental, health, and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent . The complexity of our platform and changes required to comply with the large number of varying  requirements can lead to constraints on supply as well as compliance gaps .\n Host listings may also be limited by night caps, density restrictions, onerous permitting requirements, primary residence or host presence requirements, permit caps, minimum night stays, and/or discretionary permitting or lottery systems . Additional regulations could necessitate significant platform changes, discouraging use and increasing scrutiny and liability . Violation of these laws could subject the company to fines and penalties, including criminal penalties .\n In some jurisdictions, regulations imposing restrictions on short-term rentals are increasingly fragmented at the local level, leading to increased compliance burden . These efforts, along with existing and potential new laws, could restrict short term rentals, impose registration requirements and other limits to hosts’ ability to list, and lead to significant fines and liabilities .\n We face litigation, inquiries, investigations, audits, and proceedings with governments and other entities over regulations affecting short-term rentals and platform liability . Changes in legal interpretations could further impact our operations . We are subject to claims related to incidents at listings, such as personal injuries, cancellations and refunds, as well as class action lawsuits and government inquiries .\n Adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may result in significant financial penalties, changes to business practices, increased costs and reputational damage . As we expand, we anticipate continued legal challenges that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . We offer travel insurance products to guests, which subject us and our business to extensive laws, regulations, and supervision .\n Travel insurance products subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we transact business by state insurance departments . Noncompliance with any of such state statutes may subject us to regulatory action by the relevant state insurance regulator, and, in certain states, private litigation . Failure to comply with applicable state and foreign laws and regulations could result in fines, investigations and/or civil or criminal proceedings against us .\n Our payments operations are subject to extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing government regulation and oversight . Failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . We regularly assess our compliance programs and may identify gaps requiring costly enhancements to our policies and controls .\n Airbnb Ireland Unlimited Company and Airbnb UK Services Limited operate as an “appointed representative” and utilize the license of regulated third parties (“principal firms”) The complexity of global regulations may trigger overlapping investigations by multiple authorities . Maintaining robust internal controls is essential to comply with these regulations . Failure to do so could result in reputational damage and substantial penalties .\n Airbnb Payments is regulated as a “Money Services Business” by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in the U.S. Compliance involves handling customer funds, record-keeping, and reporting, with potential licensing needs in unlicensed states due to regulatory changes . Compliance with EEA and UK regulations involves complex and potentially onerous requirements, including operational and payment security and strong customer authentication .\n In unclear regulatory environments, we partner with local banks and processors, but may face restrictions from local regulators or need additional licenses or approvals . Obtaining and maintaining compliance with global licensing and regulatory requirements incurs significant costs and operational changes . Violations of consumer protection laws could lead to fines, penalties, and changes in business practices .\n We are subject to various AML and CTF laws and regulations around the world, including the BSA and the UK Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017 (as amended) Non-compliance could result in financial penalties . We also issue gift cards in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and many other jurisdictions .\n The EU has agreed and adopted a comprehensive package of measures to reform the primary AML, CTF legislation across all EU 27 Member States . Non-compliance with local laws implementing EU directives could result in fines up to 10% of APLux’s annual revenue . Failure to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations could subject us to liability and negatively affect our business .\n We must comply with economic and trade sanctions from governments where we operate . Future sanctions in key business areas could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition . We maintain and regularly update internal controls and report to OFAC, OFSI, and Luxembourg authorities on blocked or rejected payments and potential violations . As we grow and as regulations evolve, we may need to invest further in our internal controls or adjust our operations .\n Compliance demands significant resources and ongoing attention, and any system failures could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . Non-compliance with payment card network rules could breach our contracts with payment processors, leading to fines, penalties, and potential loss of card processing capabilities . Failure to comply with these standards could result in losing our payment card acceptance privileges .\n Airbnb is not engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities . We do, however, make minority investments in companies and acquire other financial instruments from time to time that may be deemed investment securities . There is no guarantee that we will continue to be exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act without taking actions that may adversely affect our operations .\n Many ESG initiatives (including related metrics and targets) are based on methodologies, standards, and data that are still evolving or are subject to variable interpretation . The regulatory landscape for ESG issues is also rapidly evolving, and various policymakers have adopted (or are considering adopting) requirements for climate- or other ESG-related disclosures .\n The Internet and technology industries frequently face litigation over intellectual property rights, including allegations of infringement or misappropriation . The EU's Omnibus Simplification Package introduces further complexity and uncertainty in the European Union . Compliance involves significant expenses and resources, with risks of errors in implementing necessary changes . These requirements are not uniform and may not be interpreted or applied uniformly, which may increase the cost and complexity of compliance .\n We receive communications from third parties, including practicing and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed, misused, or otherwise misappropriated their intellectual property rights . As we expand our offerings or acquire new businesses, our exposure to intellectual property claims may increase . Third parties may assert infringement claims related to newly acquired technologies or business areas .\n Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant . The company will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law . The Company may also advance expenses, as incurred, to our employees and agents in connection with defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition, contingent on their agreement to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification .\n We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other laws in the United States and elsewhere . We are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees, and agents . We may not retroactively amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws to reduce our indemnification obligations relating to any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment or repeal . We have operations in and deal with countries known to experience corruption.\n Existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective . Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations may result in extensive internal or external investigations as well as significant financial penalties and reputational harm . Compliance requirements may require us to revise or expand compliance programs, including procedures we use to monitor international and domestic transactions .\n We process personal data, such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, nationality, location information, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, and identity verification information . Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data processing practices, potentially increasing compliance costs or adversely affecting our business . We and our vendors must comply with various state, federal, and foreign data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements .\n Our technology platform incorporates the use of AI and ML Technologies, for example, for fraud detection, search, enabling customized features and enhancing community support . In addition, certain existing legal regimes, including those relating to data privacy and consumer protection, regulate certain aspects of AI . In the U.S. in 2024, California enacted seventeen new laws in 2024 that further regulate the use .\n The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the “EU AI Act”) entered into force in August 2024, and establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market . The majority of the substantive requirements will apply from August 2026 . Many large geographies in which we operate, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, and South Korea have passed or are in the process of passing robust data privacy and security legislation .\n In relation to cross-border transfers of personal data outside of Europe, we expect the existing legal complexity and uncertainty regarding international personal data transfers to continue . The European Commission approval of the current EU-US Data Privacy Framework may be challenged, which could also lead to challenges to, or impact, the effectiveness of, other data transfer mechanisms .\n There are numerous U.S. data privacy and security laws governing the collection, maintenance, disclosure and processing of personal data . To date, we have not received any fines in respect of statutory inquiries . We have in place an internal process to review and process such inquiries to ensure we respond appropriately and update our privacy compliance with any findings .\n Several states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the processing of state residents’ personal data . The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides enhanced data privacy rights to California residents . The enactment of the CCPA prompted a wave of similar legislative developments in other states, which creates a patchwork of overlapping but different laws .\n Recent European court and regulator decisions are driving increased attention to cookies and similar tracking technologies, which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure . Failure to comply with the DSA can result in fines of up to 6% of total annual worldwide turnover and recipients of services have the right to seek compensation from providers in respect of damage or loss suffered due to infringement .\n Failure to comply with the OSA can result in fines of up to 10% of total annual worldwide turnover or £18 million (whichever is greater) Compliance with numerous and often contradictory requirements of different jurisdictions is particularly difficult for an online business such as ours, which collects personal information from hosts, guests, and other individuals in multiple jurisdictions .\n To help improve the trust and safety on our platform, we conduct certain verification procedures aimed at our hosts, guests, and listings in certain jurisdictions . These types of activities expose us to requirements of other laws and regulations, and to the risk of regulatory engagement and/or enforcement from privacy regulators, consumer protection agencies, consumer credit reporting agencies, and civil litigation .\n As we are subject to both the EU and the UK GDPR, we could be fined under each regime independently in respect of the same breach . Penalties for certain breaches are up to the greater of €20 million or £17.5 million, or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater .\n ogy infrastructure, and online sites and networks for both internal and external operations that are critical to our business . We own and manage some of these IT Systems but also rely on third-party IT Systems for certain operations, including payment processing and accounting . We have experienced IT System failures from time to time . Our reliance on the Internet and mobile networks could also lead to disruptions in access .\n If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and our data, then our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected . This includes registered domain names, registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks, and copyrights, patents, and patent applications, patent applications . In the future, we may acquire or license additional patents or patent portfolios .\n There are significant risks involved in adopting, developing, maintaining, and deploying these technologies, and there can be no assurance that the usage of these technologies will enhance our products or services . The rapid evolution of AI and ML Technologies will continue to require the application of significant resources to adopt, develop, test, integrate, and maintain AI and . maintain AI . technologies included in our offerings .\n AI and ML Technologies may be incorrectly designed or implemented; may be trained or reliant on incomplete, inadequate, inaccurate, biased, or otherwise poor quality data . We could incur liability and costs resulting from the actual or perceived violation of laws or contracts to which we are a party or civil claims . We may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, consumer complaints, legal liability, and other adverse consequences .\n Development, maintenance and operation of AI and ML Technologies requires additional investment in the development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models, and systems to monitor and test for accuracy, bias, and other variables . Developing, testing, and deploying AI andML Technologies also increase associated computing costs . We cannot control the quality, availability or pricing of such third-party software and infrastructure .\n We face competition from other companies in our industry with respect to the development and deployment of AI and ML Technologies to enhance our competitive offerings . We cannot predict how future legislation and regulation will impact our ability to offer and protect products or services that we develop which leverage AI . We may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations .\n AI and ML Technologies are expected to continue to be proposed and enacted in the United States and globally . Any actual or perceived failure by us or our vendors to comply may result in significant liability, litigation or other legal action against us, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and/or result in regulatory scrutiny, fines and penalties .\n Airbnb could face liability for information or content on or accessible through our platform . Content on our platform is typically generated by third parties, and not by us . Claims of defamation, disparagement, negligence, warranty, personal harm, intellectual property infringement, or other alleged damages could be asserted against us . New regulations could increase our liability and compliance costs, impacting our business .\n The EU's Consumer Rights Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive impose strict consumer protection requirements, with potential fines for non-compliance . Compliance with these evolving regulations may increase operational costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . Despite our investments, we cannot guarantee these measures will be successful .\n Airbnb is subject to payment-related fraud, and an increase in or failure to deal effectively with fraud, fraudulent activities, fictitious transactions, or illegal transactions would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . We process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis . The capabilities of criminal fraudsters and the susceptibility of individuals to fraud pose ongoing risks .\n We incorporate certain open-source software into our code base as we continue to develop our platform and services . Failure to reduce fraud could result in fines, higher fees, or loss of payment card network access, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition . Open sourcing our own software requires us to make the source code publicly available, which limits our ability to protect our intellectual property rights .\n There is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses . The company could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software .\n We own and manage some IT Systems but also rely on third parties for a range of IT Systems and related products and services . We face evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our and our third-party providers’ IT Systems . As we expand our technology use and collaborate with third parties, managing these threats becomes more challenging .\n We encrypt certain data in transit and at rest, but advances in hacking and AI and machine learning may challenge our defenses . Acquisitions of companies with vulnerable IT Systems further expose us to cybersecurity risks . Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques that circumvent controls, evade detection and remove forensic evidence .\n We rely primarily on Amazon Web Services in the United States and abroad to host and deliver our platform . Third parties provide services to key aspects of our operations, including Internet connections and networking, messaging, data storage and processing . We do not control the operation, physical security, or data security of any of these third-party providers . There can be no assurance that our service providers will anticipate or prevent all types of attacks .\n Our service providers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events . Third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations . Our systems currently do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing or payment processing, and business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective .\n The market price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations . Our long-term strategies, such as enhancing platform trust and safety, improving community support, investing in relationships, and adapting to regulations, may not result in the long term benefits that we expect . Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected .\n The economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry; . ections we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;  financial expectations of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our Company, or . any major change in our board of directors, . management, or key personnel;                 : major change in board of . directors, management, . key personnel, or major changes in the application of existing laws that impact our business, hosts, and/or guests, including changes in short-term occupancy and tax laws .\n Our multi-series structure may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock . In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of stock volatility . If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business .\n Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors . The manner, timing and amount of any share repurchased may fluctuate and will be determined by us based on a variety of factors . Our share repurchase programs may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time .\n Under our restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 2,000,000 shares of Class C common stock . Any future issuance may have the effect of further concentrating voting control in the holders of our Class B common stock, including our founders, and may discourage potential acquisitions of our business . The Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), is not convertible into any other capital stock .\n This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us that stockholders may otherwise support . If we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, such issuances would have a dilutive effect on the economic interests of our Class A and Class B common stock .\n There has been increased volatility in the financial and securities markets, which has generally made access to capital less certain and increased the cost of obtaining new capital . If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our ability to continue to support our business and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected .\n Our Class A common stock has one vote per share . Our founders hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock . The holders of our Class B common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power . This concentrated control limits or precludes other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future .\n Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Class B holder into one share of Class A common stock . This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that stockholders may believe are in their best interest . Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A .\n Anti-takeover provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could impair a takeover attempt . Delaware law contains provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors . Each outstanding share of Class H common stock will convert into a share of a Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis .\n The ability of our board of directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval . The board could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror . Stockholders may adopt, amend, or repeal bylaws only with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all our then-outstanding shares of capital stock .\n Delaware law prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our common stock . Federal district courts of the U.S. of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting   of directors then in office or the chairperson of our board .\n A cause of action under the Securities Act could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees . The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (b) any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder to the Company .\n Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), from bringing such claims in federal court . Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause us irreparable harm, and we will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance .\n There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act . The choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees, agents, or stockholders .\n There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and confidential information . We have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition .\n Our management team is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats . The team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program . Management updates the Audit Committee, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential . The management team has over 20 years of cybersecurity technology leadership experience ."
