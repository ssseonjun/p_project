In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \nChange in estimated useful life of tower assets - Refer to Notes 1, 3, 4, and 5 to the financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets, effective as of January 1, 2024. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets should be changed from 20 years to 30 years. Additionally, consistent with the useful life of the tower assets, the Company changed the useful life of certain intangible assets as well as lease terms used to measure the right of use assets and lease liabilities.\nThe Company accounted for the change in useful life as a change in accounting estimate and applied the change on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Company began depreciating its tower assets and amortizing certain intangible assets over the extended useful life. The change in useful life resulted in (i) a $515 million increase to the right of use assets and related lease liabilities as of January 1, 2024 and (ii) an estimated $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nWe identified the change in estimated useful life of tower assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support the useful life of the tower assets. There was a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating \nF-2\nTable of Contents\n \nmanagement’s assumptions and estimates and required the assistance of valuation specialists to validate the appropriateness of assumptions made by management.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \nOur audit procedures related to the change in estimated useful life of tower assets included the following, among others: \n•\nWe inquired of management and operations and engineering personnel to understand the process to build, inspect, and maintain tower assets.\n•\nWe inquired of management’s independent consultant to understand the processes and procedures that were used to develop the revised estimates of useful life.\n•\nWe utilized our fair value specialists that possess relevant engineering expertise to assist us with:\n◦\nAssessing the technical specifications of the Company’s towers and the Company’s operating procedures, as those specifications and procedures impact the useful life of the towers.\n◦\nPerforming independent research on the useful life of towers.\n•\nFor a selection of countries, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the tower data used by the Company in supporting the change in estimated useful life.\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the development of the estimates of the useful life of the tower assets and the controls over measuring and recognizing the financial statement impacts of the change in estimate. \n•\nWith the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in lease accounting, we evaluated the Company’s conclusions regarding the accounting for the impact of the change in estimated useful life of the tower assets on the right of use assets and operating lease liabilities.\n/s/

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \n1.    \nBUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness\n—American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “ATC” or the “Company”) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company’s primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company refers to this business, inclusive of its data center business discussed below, as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services in the United States, which the Company refers to as its services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting (“AZP”), structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support the Company’s site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The Company’s customers include its tenants, licensees and other payers.\nThe Company’s portfolio primarily consists of towers that it owns and towers that it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that it leases primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators and holds a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that the Company provides for the leasing of space primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\nAmerican Tower Corporation is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. ATC’s principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures. \nThe Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, the Company generally is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers and in its data centers, as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that offsets its REIT taxable income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, the Company’s international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\nThe use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of its U.S. DAS networks business, its Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of its operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain and Uganda.\n \nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\n—The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity method or as investments in equity securities, depending upon the Company’s ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company holds (i) a \n52\n% controlling interest in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of the Company’s operations in France, Germany and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, “ATC Europe”) (Allianz and CDPQ (each as defined in note 15) hold the noncontrolling interests), (ii) a \n51\n% controlling interest in a joint venture whose holdings consist of the Company’s operations in Bangladesh (Confidence Tower Holdings Ltd. (“Confidence Group”) holds the noncontrolling interest) and (iii) a controlling common equity interest of approximately \n72\n% in the Company’s U.S. data center business (Stonepeak (as defined and further discussed in note 15) holds approximately \n28\n% of the outstanding common equity and \n100\n% of the outstanding mandatorily convertible preferred equity). As of December 31, 2024, ATC Europe holds an \n87\n% and an \n83\n% controlling interest in subsidiaries that consist of the Company’s operations in Germany and Spain, respectively (PGGM holds the noncontrolling interests). See note 15 for a discussion of changes to the Company’s noncontrolling interests during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nATC TIPL Transaction—\nOn September 12, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its subsidiary ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”), which held the Company’s operations in India (the “ATC TIPL Transaction”). The divestiture qualified for presentation as discontinued operations. See note 22 for further discussion. Prior to the divestiture and classification as discontinued operations, ATC TIPL’s operating results were included within the Asia-Pacific property segment. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the operating results of ATC TIPL as discontinued operations for all periods presented. \nAustralia & New Zealand—\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company, through its subsidiary, ATC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., entered into agreements to sell \n100\n% of the ownership interests in its subsidiaries in Australia (“ATC Australia”) and New Zealand (“ATC New Zealand”). On November 11, 2024, the Company completed the sale of ATC Australia for total consideration of \n63.4\n million Australian Dollars (approximately $\n41.2\n million at the date of closing). On December 11, 2024, the Company completed the sale of ATC New Zealand for total consideration of \n62.5\n million New Zealand Dollars (approximately $\n36.4\n million at the date of closing). The Company recorded a gain on the sales of ATC Australia and ATC New Zealand of $\n8.5\n million, which is included in \nOther operating expenses\n in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the divestitures, ATC Australia and ATC New Zealand’s operating results were included within the Africa & APAC property segment. The divestitures did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.\nChange in Reportable Segments—\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its reportable segments. The Company’s Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) property segment and its Africa property segment were combined into the Africa & APAC property segment. As a result, the Company has \nsix\n reportable segments: U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company’s data center facilities and related assets), Africa & APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services, which are discussed further in note 20. The change in reportable segments had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. \nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in \nseven\n segments: U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include impairment of long-lived assets (including goodwill), revenue recognition, rent expense and lease accounting, income taxes and accounting for business combinations and acquisitions of assets. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued as additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure.\nAssets Held for Sale\n—The Company considers long-lived assets to be “held for sale” upon satisfaction of the following criteria: (a) management commits to a plan to sell an asset (or group of assets), (b) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets, (c) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated, (d) the sale of the asset is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year, (e) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and (f) actions required to  complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Typically, these criteria are all met when the relevant assets are under contract, significant non-refundable deposits have been made by the potential buyer, the assets are immediately available for transfer and there are no contingencies related to the sale that may prevent the transaction from closing.\nAssets classified as held for sale are reported at the lesser of the carrying value, or estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell and are not depreciated. The Company reassesses the fair value less costs to sell of assets held for sale in each reporting period in which they are classified as held for sale. Gains (losses) on held for sale assets are recorded in Other operating income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n \nDiscontinued Operations\n—The Company classifies the results of operations related to a disposal of assets and liabilities (“the disposal group”) in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations if all of the following criteria are met: (a) the operations and cash flows of the disposal group can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Company, (b) the \nF-10\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \ndisposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale (as described above) or has been sold or disposed of by other means and (c) the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results.\nThe results of operations classified as discontinued operations are reported in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Historical financial information included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements is adjusted to reflect the classification of results of operations as discontinued operations.\n See note 22 for a discussion of the results of operations classified as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2024.\nAccounts Receivable and Deferred Rent Asset\n—The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of customers in the telecommunications industry, and \n60\n% of its current-year revenues are derived from \nfour\n customers. \nThe Company’s deferred rent asset is associated with non-cancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable lease for which revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its customers. In recognizing customer revenue, the Company assesses the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes customer credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, revenue recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and are subsequently determined to present a risk of collection are reserved as bad debt expense included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounts receivable is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a customer’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. These allowances are generally estimated based on payment patterns, days past due and collection history, and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends, such as customers in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowances or reserves when they are determined to be uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account.\n \nChanges in the allowances were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance as of January 1,\n$\n325.2\n \n$\n217.8\n \n$\n232.5\n \nCurrent year increases\n130.5\n \n66.5\n \n59.9\n \nWrite-offs, recoveries and other\n(\n51.6\n)\n40.9\n \n(\n74.6\n)\nBalance as of December 31,\n$\n404.1\n \n$\n325.2\n \n$\n217.8\n \nFunctional Currency\n—The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is normally the respective local currency, except for Argentina, Costa Rica, Ghana and Nigeria, where the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. All foreign currency assets and liabilities held by the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reflected in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. \nGains and losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. However, the effect from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany debt for which repayment is not anticipated in the foreseeable future is reflected in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income.\n \nF-11\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nThe Company recorded the following net foreign currency (gains) losses:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nForeign currency losses (gains) recorded in AOCL\n$\n660.8\n \n$\n(\n103.9\n)\n$\n336.7\n \nForeign currency (gains) losses recorded in Other expense\n(\n308.3\n)\n330.6\n \n(\n451.4\n)\nTotal foreign currency losses (gains)\n$\n352.5\n \n$\n226.7\n \n$\n(\n114.7\n)\nAdoption of Highly Inflationary Accounting in Ghana and Nigeria—\nThe Ghanaian economy was deemed to be highly inflationary and, as a result, the Company adopted highly inflationary accounting as of January 1, 2024 for its subsidiary in Ghana. Under highly inflationary accounting, the functional currency of its subsidiary in Ghana became the U.S. Dollar. All monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at the U.S. Dollar to Ghanaian Cedis exchange rate of 1 to \n11.95\n as of December 31, 2023. These amounts became the new basis for those assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2024. Non-monetary assets and liabilities, as well as the corresponding income statement activities such as depreciation, amortization and equity, will continue to be measured at the historical exchange rate on December 31, 2023. \nThe Nigerian economy was deemed to be highly inflationary and, as a result, the Company adopted highly inflationary accounting as of October 1, 2024 for its subsidiary in Nigeria. Under highly inflationary accounting, the functional currency of its subsidiary in Nigeria became the U.S. Dollar. All monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at the U.S. Dollar to Nigerian Naira exchange rate of 1 to \n1,669\n as of September 30, 2024. These amounts became the new basis for those assets and liabilities as of October 1, 2024. Non-monetary assets and liabilities, as well as the corresponding income statement activities such as depreciation, amortization and equity, will continue to be measured at the historical exchange rate on September 30, 2024. \nGains and losses on foreign currency arising in connection with the remeasurement of local currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities for foreign operating subsidiaries in economies that are deemed to be highly inflationary are reflected in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. These changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements, as Ghana’s assets and revenue are approximately \n1\n% and \n1\n% of consolidated assets and revenue, respectively, and Nigeria’s assets and revenue are approximately \n1\n% and \n4\n% of consolidated assets and revenue, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n—Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its deposits at high-quality financial institutions and monitors the credit ratings of those institutions.\nRestricted Cash—\nRestricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral to secure obligations and all cash whose use is otherwise limited by contractual provisions.\nThe reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the applicable balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows is as follows: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,999.6\n \n$\n1,753.7\n \n$\n1,548.9\n \nRestricted cash\n108.6\n \n119.7\n \n111.1\n \nCash and cash equivalents included in assets of discontinued operations\n—\n \n219.6\n \n479.5\n \nRestricted cash included in assets of discontinued operations\n—\n \n0.4\n1.2\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n2,108.2\n \n$\n2,093.4\n \n$\n2,140.7\n \nProperty and Equipment\n—Property and equipment is recorded at cost or, in the case of acquired properties, at estimated fair value on the date acquired. Cost for self-constructed sites includes direct materials and labor and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the site, such as transportation costs, employee benefits and payroll taxes. The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site, and continues to capitalize costs until the site is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a customer. Labor and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n67.4\n million, $\n62.1\n million and $\n62.4\n million, respectively. \nF-12\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives. The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over \n20\n years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating experience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be \n20\n years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is \n30\n years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company’s intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 \nAccounting Changes and Error Corrections\n, which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the extended useful life and residual value. The extension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approximately $\n515\n million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $\n730\n million ($\n649\n million after tax, or an increase of $\n1.39\n per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding \nthirty years\n.\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n—The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company’s goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n322.0\n million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company’s Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n80.0\n million. The goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no other goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nIntangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from \ntwo\n to \nthirty years\n and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nThe Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, the customer’s ability to meet its contractual obligations, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair value, as compared to the asset’s carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\nFair Value Measurements\n—The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n \nAsset Retirement Obligations\n—When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its assets and remediate the leased space upon which certain of its assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with remediation costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible asset. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of asset removals; cost of asset removals; timing and number of site lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.\nThe Company finalized its review of the estimated settlement dates for its asset retirement obligations during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over \n20\n years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimated settlement dates based on its historical operating experience, management’s intent with respect to the assets, and the assets’ estimated useful lives. Based on its review and analysis, the Company concluded that a revision in the estimated settlement dates for its asset retirement obligations was appropriate. The Company accounted for the change in estimated settlement dates as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 \nAccounting Changes and Error Corrections\n, which was recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. The extension in the estimated settlement dates (i) resulted in a $\n470\n million increase in the asset retirement obligation liability, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible asset and an $\n875\n million increase in the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations, and (ii) resulted in an estimated $\n75\n million decrease in accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n \nIncome Taxes\n—As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nThe Company estimates the liabilities from uncertain tax positions, which are recorded in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense and interest income from tax refunds as a component of the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n—Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consisted of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments, reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges and other items.\n The AOCL balance included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $\n6.0\n billion, $\n5.7\n billion and $\n5.7\n billion as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nDistributions\n—As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, the Company has distributed, and expects to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”). \nThe amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company’s control, including the Company’s financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in the Company’s existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, the Company’s ability to utilize NOLs to offset the Company’s distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nAcquisitions\n—For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All other acquisitions are accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill. The purchase price is not subsequently adjusted. \nThe fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life and productive capacity of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must estimate the timing and amount of future cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition, and apply the applicable discount rate.\n \nRevenue\n—The Company’s revenue is derived from leasing the right to use its communications sites, the land on which the sites are located, the land underlying its customers’ sites and the space in its data center facilities (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company in operating the communications sites and data center facilities and supporting its customers’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of the Company’s revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, the Company separately determines the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Revenue related to DAS networks and fiber and other related assets results from agreements with customers that are generally not accounted for as leases. \nThe Company’s revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index (“CPI”), or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Company’s tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n277.6\n million, $\n465.4\n million and $\n508.5\n million, respectively. \nNon-lease property revenue—\nNon-lease property revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from DAS networks, fiber and other property related revenue. DAS networks and fiber arrangements generally require that the Company provide the tenant the right to use available capacity on the applicable communications infrastructure. Performance obligations are satisfied \nF-15\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nover time for the duration of the arrangements. Non-lease property revenue also includes revenue generated from interconnection offerings in the Company’s data center facilities. Interconnection offerings are generally contracted on a month-to-month basis and are cancellable by the Company or the data center customer at any time. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Other property related revenue streams, which include site inspections, are not material on either an individual or consolidated basis.\nServices revenue—\nThe Company offers tower-related services in the United States. These services include AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management. There is a single performance obligation related to AZP and construction management, and revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs expected to be incurred. Structural and mount analyses services may have more than one performance obligation, contingent upon the number of contracted services. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the services are completed.\nSome of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is typically based on the price charged to customers in a stand-alone transaction. \nSince most of the Company’s contracts are leases, costs to enter into lease arrangements are capitalized under the applicable lease accounting guidance. Costs incurred to obtain non-lease contracts that are capitalized primarily relate to DAS networks and are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has excluded sales tax, value added tax and similar taxes from non-lease revenue. \nRevenue is disaggregated by geography in a manner consistent with the Company’s business segments, which are discussed further in note 20.

Long-term unearned revenue is included in Other non-current liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $\n116.8\n million of revenue that was previously included in the contract liabilities balances, primarily arising from balances as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company records unbilled receivables, which are included in Prepaids and other current assets, when it has completed a performance obligation prior to its ability to bill under the customer arrangement. Other contract assets are included in Notes receivable and other non-current assets. The Company recorded an immaterial change in unbilled receivables attributable to non-lease property revenue recognized during each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The changes in contract assets attributable to revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were immaterial. \nThe Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for agreements (i) with an original expected length of one year or less or (ii) for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.\n \nLease Accounting and Rent Expense\n—The Company accounts for leases using a right-of-use model, which recognizes that, at the date of commencement, a lessee has a financial obligation to make lease payments to the lessor for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term. The lessee also recognizes a corresponding right-of-use asset related to this right. \nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, as part of its asset portfolio. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\nThe calculation of the lease liability requires the Company to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, the Company considers the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to the Company and the lessor. The Company determines the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term.\nMany of the leases underlying the Company’s sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the Company over time. In addition, certain of the Company’s tenant leases require the Company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. The Company’s calculation of the lease liability includes the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the Company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured.\nThe straight-line component of ground rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n46.8\n million, $\n24.4\n million and $\n34.0\n million, respectively. \nSelling, General, Administrative and Development Expense\n—Selling, general and administrative expense consists of overhead expenses related to the Company’s property and services operations and corporate overhead costs not specifically allocable to any of the Company’s individual business operations. Development expense consists of costs related to the Company’s acquisition efforts, costs associated with new business initiatives and project cancellation costs.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nStock-Based Compensation\n—Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as an expense over the service period, which typically represents the vesting period. The Company provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employee’s death or permanent disability, or upon an employee’s qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) over the shorter of (i) the vesting period or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such benefits due to death, disability or qualified retirement, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized includes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. Equity awards typically vest ratably. Awards of RSUs and stock options granted prior to March 10, 2023 generally vest over \nfour years\n. In December 2022, the Company’s Compensation Committee changed the terms of its awards to generally vest over \nthree years\n. The change in vesting terms is applicable for new awards granted beginning on March 10, 2023 and does not change the vesting terms applicable to grants awarded prior to March 10, 2023.\nThe Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) to its executive officers. Threshold, target and maximum parameters are established for a \nthree-year\n performance period at the time of grant. The metrics are used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when the awards vest, which may range from \nzero\n to \n200\n% of the target amounts. The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs over the \nthree-year\n vesting period, subject to adjustment based on the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement benefits as well as performance relative to grant parameters. The Company’s PSUs granted in 2024 also include a market condition component. \nThe fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. For the component of the PSUs subject to a market condition, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. The Company recognizes all stock-based compensation expense in Selling, general, administrative and development expense. \nIn connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, the Company withholds from issuance a number of shares of common stock to satisfy certain employee tax withholding obligations arising from such vesting. The shares withheld are considered constructively retired. The Company recognizes the fair value of the shares withheld in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.\n As of December 31, 2024, the Company has withheld from issuance an aggregate of \n3.3\n million shares, including \n0.3\n million shares related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nLitigation Costs\n—The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. The Company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss. The Company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss, or possible range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those liabilities may be required. The Company also incurs legal costs in connection with these matters and records estimates of these expenses, which are reflected in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nEarnings Per Common Share\n—\nBasic and Diluted\n—Basic net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including (A) shares issuable upon the vesting of RSUs and exercise of stock options and (B) shares expected to be earned upon the achievement of the parameters established for PSUs, each to the extent not anti-dilutive. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of its outstanding RSUs, PSUs and stock options.\n \nRetirement Plan\n—The Company has a 401(k) plan covering nearly all eligible employees who meet certain age and employment requirements.\n For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company matched \n100\n% of the first \n5\n% of a participant's contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company contributed $\n15.0\n million, $\n15.6\n million and $\n15.8\n million to the plan, respectively.\nStonepeak Development Partnership— \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Stonepeak (as defined in note 15) to form a joint venture to construct a new data center in Denver, CO (the “Stonepeak Development Partnership”). At formation, the Company contributed assets with a value of $\n14.6\n million to the Stonepeak Development Partnership and acquired a minority ownership interest (Stonepeak holds the controlling interests). The Company accounts for the Stonepeak Development Partnership as an equity method investment. Under this method, investments are \nF-18\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nrecorded at cost, and are adjusted for the Company’s share of the entities’ income or loss and for distributions and contributions. The investment is recorded in Other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAccounting Standards Updates\n—In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through additional disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance which requires public entities to provide enhanced income tax disclosures on an annual basis. The new guidance requires an expanded rate reconciliation and the disaggregation of cash taxes paid by U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance which is intended to improve the disclosures about a public business entity’s expenses, primarily through additional disclosures about the types of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion) included in each relevant expense caption presented on the face of the income statement within continuing operations. The guidance is effective on a prospective basis, with the option for retrospective application, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n2.    \nPREPAID AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS \nPrepaid and other current assets consisted of the following:   \nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nPrepaid assets\n$\n82.6\n \n$\n90.7\n \nPrepaid income tax\n77.2\n \n62.7\n \nUnbilled receivables\n189.3\n \n185.9\n \nValue added tax and other consumption tax receivables\n55.5\n \n79.8\n \nOther miscellaneous current assets\n126.0\n \n140.4\n \nPrepaid and other current assets\n$\n530.6\n \n$\n559.5\n \n3.    \nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  \nProperty and equipment (including assets held under finance leases) consisted of the following:\n \nEstimated \nUseful Lives (years)\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nTowers (1)\nUp to \n30\n$\n15,745.0\n \n$\n15,499.9\n \nEquipment (2)\n3\n - \n20\n4,921.8\n \n4,480.5\n \nBuildings and improvements\nUp to \n40\n3,786.3\n \n3,775.1\n \nLand and improvements (3)\nUp to \n30\n4,311.0\n \n4,265.4\n \nConstruction-in-progress\n1,298.4\n \n1,355.4\n \nTotal\n30,062.5\n \n29,376.3\n \nLess accumulated depreciation \n(\n11,005.7\n)\n(\n10,513.1\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n19,056.8\n \n$\n18,863.2\n \n_______________\n(1)    Beginning on January 1, 2024, towers are amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account residual value, generally up to \n30\n years.

The Company considers an arrangement to be a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of the communications infrastructure or ground space underneath communications infrastructure for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company is both a lessor and a lessee.\nLessor\n—The Company is a lessor in most of its revenue arrangements, as property revenue is derived from tenant leases of specifically-identified, physically distinct space on or in the Company’s communications real estate assets. The Company’s lease arrangements with its tenants for its communications sites vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant and generally have initial non-cancellable terms of \nfive\n to \nten years\n with multiple renewal terms. The leases also contain provisions that periodically increase the rent due, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage or an inflationary index, or a combination of both. The Company structures its leases to include financial penalties if a tenant terminates the lease, which serve to disincentivize tenants from terminating the lease prior to the expiration of the lease term. \nThe Company’s leasing arrangements outside of the United States may require that the Company provide power to the communications site through an electrical grid connection, diesel fuel generators or other sources and permit the Company to pass through the costs of, or otherwise charge for, these services. Many arrangements require that the communications site has power for a specified percentage of time. In most cases, if delivery of power falls below the specified service level, a corresponding reduction in revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. In addition, the Company provides power to its data center customers, which is passed through, or otherwise charged, to customers pursuant to the terms of the customer power arrangement. Customer power arrangements are coterminous with such customer’s underlying lease and have the same pattern of transfer over the lease term. This performance obligation is generally satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. Fixed power revenue is recognized each month over the term of the lease. For variable power arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue each month as the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved.\nThe Company typically has more than \none\n tenant on a site and, by performing ordinary course repair and maintenance work, can often lease a site, either through renewing existing agreements or leasing to new tenants, for periods beyond the existing tenant lease term. Accordingly, the Company has minimal risk with respect to the residual value of its leased assets. \nF-20\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nCommunications infrastructure assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which generally do not exceed \nthirty years\n.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessor. To the extent there are any intercompany leases, these are eliminated in consolidation.\nHistorically, the Company has been able to successfully renew its applicable leases as needed to ensure continuation of its revenue. Accordingly, the Company assumes that it will have access to the communications infrastructure or ground space underlying its sites when calculating future minimum rental receipts through the end of the respective terms. \nFuture minimum rental receipts expected under non-cancellable operating lease agreements as of December 31, 2024, were as follows:\nFiscal Year\n Amount (1) (2)\n2025\n$\n7,749.4\n \n2026\n7,345.2\n \n2027\n7,196.5\n \n2028\n5,888.8\n \n2029\n5,536.1\n \nThereafter\n20,040.7\n \nTotal\n$\n53,756.7\n \n_______________\n(1)    Balances are translated at the applicable period-end exchange rate, which may impact comparability between periods.    \n(2)    Balances represent contractual amounts owned with no adjustments made for expected collectibility.\n \nThe Company generally does not enter into sales-type leases or direct financing leases. If incentives are present in the Company’s leases, they are evaluated to determine proper treatment and, to the extent present, are recorded in Other current assets and Other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized on a straight line basis over the corresponding lease term as a non-cash reduction to revenue. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company’s lease incentives wa\ns \n10\n years\n. As of December 31, 2024, Other current assets and Other non-current assets include $\n36.7\n million and $\n328.7\n million, respectively, for lease incentives. In addition, the Company’s leases do not include any lessee purchase options.\nLessee\n—The Company enters into arrangements as a lessee primarily for ground space underneath its communications sites. These arrangements are typically long-term lease agreements with initial non-cancellable terms of approximately \nfive\n to \nten years\n with \none\n or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods and specified increases in lease payments upon renewal. The Company typically exercises its ground lease renewal options in order to utilize the assets used and provide ongoing tenant space on or in its communications sites through the end of the tenant lease term. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to CPI or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lease term of the applicable lease as a component of rent expense. Additionally, the escalations tied to CPI or another inflation-based index are considered variable lease payments. In certain circumstances, the Company enters into revenue sharing arrangements with the ground space owner, which results in variability in lease payments. In most markets outside of the United States, in the event there are no tenants on the communications site, the Company generally has unilateral termination rights and in certain situations, the lease is structured to allow for termination by the Company with minimal or no penalties. Ground lease arrangements usually include annual escalations and do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictions on dividends, other financial obligations or other similar terms. The Company has entered into certain transactions whereby at the end of a lease, sublease or similar arrangement, the Company has the option to purchase the corresponding communications sites. These transactions are further described in note 18. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, as a result of the change in estimated useful lives of its assets as described in note 1, the Company reviewed its lease portfolio to determine whether additional renewal options were likely to be exercised. The Company concluded that these incremental renewals were lease modifications and has accounted for them accordingly. The extension of the asset lives resulted in an approximately $\n515\n million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability.\nThe Company’s lease liability is the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments to be made over the remaining lease term, including renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company also considers termination options and factors those into the determination of lease payments when appropriate. To determine the lease term, the Company considers all renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised, taking into consideration all economic factors, including the \nF-21\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \ncommunications site’s estimated economic life (generally \nthirty years\n) and the respective lease terms of the Company’s tenants under the existing lease arrangements on such site.\nThe Company assesses its right-of-use asset and other lease-related assets for impairment, as described in note 1. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $\n0.8\n million, $\n6.7\n million and $\n8.1\n million, respectively, of impairment expense related to these assets. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessee. The Company does not have any sale-leaseback arrangements as lessee and typically does not enter into leveraged leases.\nThe Company leases certain land, buildings, equipment and office space under operating leases and land and improvements, towers, equipment and vehicles under finance leases.

As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n80.0\n million. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis included current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The reduction in the fair value of the Spain reporting unit was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital. The goodwill impairment charge is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company’s other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following: \n \n \nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\n \nEstimated Useful\nLives (years) (1)\nGross\nCarrying\nValue\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet Book\nValue\nGross\nCarrying\nValue\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet Book\nValue\nAcquired network location intangibles (2)\nUp to \n30\n$\n5,365.4\n \n$\n(\n2,659.8\n)\n$\n2,705.6\n \n$\n5,584.9\n \n$\n(\n2,622.8\n)\n$\n2,962.1\n \nAcquired tenant-related intangibles\nUp to \n30\n17,666.0\n \n(\n6,823.7\n)\n10,842.3\n \n18,328.3\n \n(\n6,477.1\n)\n11,851.2\n \nAcquired licenses and other intangibles\n2\n-\n30\n1,406.8\n \n(\n480.4\n)\n926.4\n \n1,560.7\n \n(\n441.7\n)\n1,119.0\n \nTotal other intangible assets\n$\n24,438.2\n \n$\n(\n9,963.9\n)\n$\n14,474.3\n \n$\n25,473.9\n \n$\n(\n9,541.6\n)\n$\n15,932.3\n \n_______________\n(1)    As of December 31, 2024, reflects the change in estimated useful lives as described in note 1.\n(2)    Beginning January 1, 2024, acquired network location intangibles are amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account residual value, generally up to \n30\n years, as the Company considers these intangibles to be directly related to the tower assets. Prior to January 1, 2024, acquired network location intangibles were amortized over the shorter of the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value, or the estimated useful life of the tower, generally up to \n20\n years.\n    \nThe acquired network location intangibles represent the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth that could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired tower communications infrastructure. The acquired tenant-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of tenant contracts and relationships in place at the time of an \nF-24\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nacquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals. Other intangibles represent the value of acquired licenses, trade name and in place leases. In place lease value represents the fair value of costs avoided in securing data center customers, including vacancy periods, legal costs and commissions. In place lease value also includes assumptions on similar costs avoided upon the renewal or extension of existing leases on a basis consistent with occupancy assumptions used in the fair value of other assets.\nThe Company amortizes its acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company’s intangible assets wa\ns \n20\n years\n. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n892.0\n million, $\n1.4\n billion and $\n1.6\n billion, respectively. \nBased on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense as follows over the next five years:\nFiscal Year\nAmount\n2025\n$\n847.1\n \n2026\n812.6\n \n2027\n797.0\n \n2028\n788.0\n \n2029\n771.4\n \n6.    \nACQUISITIONS\nThe Company evaluates each of its acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed, with no recognition of goodwill. For those transactions treated as business combinations, the estimates of the fair value of the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the particular acquisition date). \nThe fair value of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While the Company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it evaluates any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period for those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date. \nImpact of current year acquisitions\n—The Company typically acquires communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites and related assets into its existing portfolio of communications sites and related assets. In the United States, acquisitions may also include data center facilities and related assets. The financial results of the Company’s acquisitions have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 from the date of the respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may depend on, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. Communications sites acquired from communications service providers may never have been operated as a business and may instead have been utilized solely by the seller as a component of its network infrastructure. An acquisition may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees. \nFor those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company recognizes acquisition and merger related expenses in the period in which they are incurred and services are received; for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price. Acquisition, disposition and merger related costs may include finder’s fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees and general administrative costs directly related to completing the transaction. Integration costs include incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data and systems, retain employees and otherwise enable the Company to operate acquired businesses or assets efficiently. The Company records acquisition, disposition and merger related expenses not subject to capitalization, as well as integration costs for all transactions, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nF-25\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded acquisition, disposition and merger related expenses for business combinations, dispositions and non-capitalized asset acquisition costs and integration costs as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAcquisition, disposition and merger related expenses\n$\n3.3\n \n$\n16.9\n \n$\n57.0\n \nIntegration costs\n$\n8.9\n \n$\n16.3\n \n$\n45.0\n \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded net benefits of $\n23.4\n million, $\n10.3\n million and $\n11.9\n million related to pre-acquisition contingencies and settlements, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2022 included acquisition and merger related costs associated with the Stonepeak Transaction (as defined in note 15).\n2024 Transactions\nThe estimated aggregate impact of the acquisitions completed in 2024 on the Company’s revenues and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 was not material to the Company’s operating results. Acquisitions completed in 2024 were included in the Company’s U.S. & Canada and Europe property segments.\nOther Acquisitions—\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company acquired a total of \n55\n communications sites, as well as other communications infrastructure assets, in the United States, Canada and France for an aggregate purchase price of $\n51.5\n million. Of the aggregate purchase price, $\n11.9\n million, inclusive of value-added tax, is reflected as a payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. These acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions and are included in the table below in “Other.” \nThe following table summarizes the allocations of the purchase prices for the fiscal year 2024 acquisitions based upon their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition:\nOther\nCurrent assets\n$\n2.7\n \nProperty and equipment\n24.5\n \nIntangible assets (1):\n     Tenant-related intangible assets\n18.2\n \n     Network location intangible assets\n4.6\n \nOther non-current assets\n3.3\n \nCurrent liabilities\n(\n0.5\n)\nOther non-current liabilities\n(\n1.3\n)\nNet assets acquired\n51.5\n \nFair value of net assets acquired\n51.5\n \nPurchase price\n$\n51.5\n \n______________\n(1)    Tenant-related intangible assets and network location intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nIn addition to the acquisitions discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company purchased \n80\n towers in connection with the AT&T transaction described in note 18 for an aggregate purchase price of $\n59.1\n million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company made \n88.6\n million EUR (approximately $\n92.8\n million) of deferred payments, including post-closing adjustments, associated with the Company’s

unamortized discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs. \n(2)    Accrued and unpaid interest on USD denominated notes is payable in USD semi-annually in arrears and will be computed from the issue date on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest on EUR denominated notes is payable in EUR annually in arrears and will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the notes, beginning on the issue date.\n(3)    The Company may redeem the notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If the Company redeems the notes on or after the par call date, the Company will not be required to pay a make-whole premium. \n(4)    Notes are denominated in EUR.   \n(5)    The original issue date for the initial \n3.100\n% Notes was June 3, 2020.

In addition, if the Company undergoes a change of control and corresponding ratings decline, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture for the notes, the Company may be required to repurchase all of the applicable notes at a purchase price equal to \n101\n% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The notes rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s other senior unsecured debt obligations and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of its subsidiaries. \nEach applicable supplemental indenture for the notes contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and its (together with its subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that the Company and its subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens does not exceed \n3.5\nx Adjusted EBITDA, \nF-32\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nas defined in the applicable supplemental indenture. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants.\nAmerican Tower Subsidiary Debt\nSecuritizations\nThe Company has several securitizations in place. Cash flows generated by the communications sites that secure the securitized debt of the Company are only available for payment of such debt and are not available to pay the Company’s other obligations or the claims of its creditors. However, subject to certain restrictions, the Company holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to service the securitized debt and other obligations arising out of the securitizations. The securitized debt is the obligation of the issuers thereof or borrowers thereunder, as applicable, and their subsidiaries, and not of the Company or its other subsidiaries.\nAmerican Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A and Series 2015-2, Class A\n—In May 2015, GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”), one of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, refinanced existing debt with cash on hand and proceeds from a private issuance (the “2015 Securitization”) of $\n350.0\n million of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A, which were subsequently repaid on the June 2020 payment date, and $\n525.0\n million of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes”). \nThe Series 2015-2 Notes were issued by GTP Acquisition Partners pursuant to a Third Amended and Restated Indenture and related series supplements, each dated as of May 29, 2015 (collectively, the “2015 Indenture”), between GTP Acquisition Partners and its subsidiaries (the “GTP Entities”) and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. The effective weighted average life and interest rate of the 2015 Notes was \n8.1\n years and \n3.029\n%, respectively, as of the date of issuance.\nThe outstanding Series 2015-2 Notes are secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the \n3,338\n communications sites (the “2015 Secured Sites”) owned by the GTP Entities and their operating cash flows, (ii) a security interest in substantially all of the personal property and fixtures of the GTP Entities, including GTP Acquisition Partners’ equity interests in its subsidiaries and (iii) the rights of the GTP Entities under a management agreement. American Tower Holding Sub II, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners, has guaranteed repayment of the Series 2015-2 Notes and pledged its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners as security for such payment obligations.\nSecured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2023-1, Subclass A and Series 2023-1, Subclass R, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Series 2018-1, Subclass R\n—On March 13, 2023, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the “2023 Securitization”), in which American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”) issued $\n1.3\n billion aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2023-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2023-1A Securities”). To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act” and, such requirements, the “Risk Retention Rules”), the Trust issued, and one of the Company’s affiliates purchased, $\n68.5\n million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2023-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2023-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2023-1A Securities, the “2023 Securities”) to retain an “eligible horizontal residual interest” (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2023 Securities.\nOn March 29, 2018, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the “2018 Securitization,” and, together with the 2023 Securitization, the “Trust Securitizations”), in which the Trust issued $\n500.0\n million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”). To satisfy the Risk Retention Rules, the Trust issued, and one of the Company’s affiliates purchased, $\n26.4\n million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) to retain an “eligible horizontal residual interest” (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Securities. \nThe assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan broken into components or “componentized” (the “Loan”), which secures each of the 2018 Securities and the 2023 Securities. The AMT Asset Subs are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the AMT Asset Subs’ interests in \n5,029\n broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets (the “Trust Sites”).\nThe 2023 Securities correspond to components of the Loan made to the AMT Asset Subs pursuant to the Second Supplement and Amendment dated as of March 13, 2023 (the “2023 Supplement”) to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 29, 2018 (the “Loan Agreement,” which continues to govern the 2018 Securities, and collectively, the “Trust Loan Agreement”).\nF-33\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nThe 2023 Securities (a) represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2023 Securities and (b) have an expected life of approximately \nfive years\n with a final repayment date in March 2053. The Series 2023-1A Securities and the Series 2023-1R Securities have interest rates of \n5.490\n% and \n5.735\n%, respectively. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made on the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2023 Securities prior to the monthly payment date in March 2028, which is the anticipated repayment date for those components.\nThe 2018 Securities (a) represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities and (b) have an expected life of approximately \nten years\n with a final repayment date in March 2048. The Series 2018-1A Securities have an interest rate of \n3.652\n% and the Series 2018-1R Securities have an interest rate of \n4.459\n%. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made on the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities prior to the monthly payment date in March 2028, which is the anticipated repayment date for such components. \nThe AMT Asset Subs are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Loan. The debt service on the Loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated from the operation of the Trust Sites held by the AMT Asset Subs. \nThe Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Trust Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the AMT Asset Subs’ personal property and fixtures and (3) the AMT Asset Subs’ rights under that certain management agreement among the AMT Asset Subs and SpectraSite Communications, LLC entered into in March 2013. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the “Guarantor”), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the AMT Asset Subs, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations.\nUnder the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable, including interest payments, subject to the conditions described below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company. \nIn order to distribute any excess cash flow to the Company, the AMT Asset Subs and GTP Acquisition Partners must each maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (the “DSCR”), which is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding \n12\n months on the principal amount of the Loan or the 2015 Notes, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. If the DSCR were equal to or below \n1.30\nx (the “Cash Trap DSCR”) for any quarter, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable. The funds in the Cash Trap Reserve Account will not be released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, unless the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for \ntwo\n consecutive calendar quarters. \nAdditionally, an “amortization period” commences if, as of the end of any calendar quarter, the DSCR is equal to or below \n1.15\nx (the “Minimum DSCR”) and will continue to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. With respect to the Trust Securities, an “amortization period” also commences if, on the anticipated repayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Trust Securities has not been repaid in full, provided that such amortization period shall apply with respect to such component that has not been repaid in full. If the Series 2015-2 Notes have not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Series 2015-2 Notes, and such notes will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, as applicable, on each monthly payment date.\nThe Loan and the Series 2015-2 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within (i) \n18\n months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, (ii) \n36\n months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2018 Securities, and (iii) 12 months of the anticipated repayment date for the 2023 Securities, no prepayment consideration is due.\nF-34\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nThe Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities, as applicable, are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture, as applicable). The organizational documents of the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that they maintain independent directors. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture also contain certain covenants that require the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, to provide the respective trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify such trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Trust Sites or the 2015 Indenture and other agreements related to the 2015 Secured Sites, as applicable, and allow the applicable trustee reasonable access to the sites, including the right to conduct site investigations.\nA failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture could prevent the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, from distributing excess cash flow to the Company. Furthermore, if the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners were to default on the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, in which case the Company could lose the revenue and cash flows associated with those assets. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than \n50\n% of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare such notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. \nFurther, under the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, respectively, are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and, under the 2015 Indenture and in certain circumstances under the Loan Agreement, to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Trust Sites. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the applicable trustee and then released. The $\n53.9\n million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the Trust Securitizations and the $\n6.9\n million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the 2015 Securitization as of December 31, 2024 are classified as Restricted cash on the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  \nOther Subsidiary Debt\n—As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s other subsidiary debt included drawn letters of credit in Nigeria (the “Nigeria Letters of Credit”).\nAmounts outstanding and key terms of other subsidiary debt consisted of the following as of December 31, (in millions, except percentages):   \nCarrying Value \n(Denominated Currency)\nCarrying Value\n (USD)\nInterest Rate\nMaturity Date\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNigeria Letters of Credit (1)\n$\n—\n \n$\n3.4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3.4\n \nVarious\nVarious\n_______________\n(1)    Denominated in USD. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we drew on letters of credit in Nigeria. The drawn amounts bear interest at a rate equal to the SOFR at the time of drawing plus a spread. Amounts are due \n270\n days from the date of drawing.\nEach of the agreements governing the other subsidiary debt contains contractual covenants and other restrictions. Failure to comply with certain of the financial and operating covenants could constitute a default under the applicable debt agreement, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.\nF-35\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nFinance Lease Obligations\n—The Company’s finance lease obligations appro\nximated $\n16.6\n million and $\n20.6\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respective\nly.

These adjustments were determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the subject assets utilizing projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the long-lived assets to the asset’s carrying value. \nThe significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of the individual tower and acquired network location intangible assets subject to impairment in 2024 and 2023 included the following: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nRange\nWeighted Average\nRange\nWeighted Average\nTerminal growth rates on cash flows (1)\n2\n% to \n8\n%\n3\n%\n2\n% to \n7\n%\n3\n%\nWeighted average cost of capital (2)\n6\n% to \n56\n%\n10\n%\n6\n% to \n46\n%\n10\n%\n_______________\n(1)\nOn a local currency basis.\n(2)\nSpecific to the country of each impaired asset.

As part of this process, the Company received indications of value from third parties, which were less than the carrying value of the India reporting unit. The Company incorporated this information as a significant input used to determine the fair value of the India reporting unit during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment of $\n322.0\n million, as discussed further in note 22.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 and determined that the carrying amount of the Spain reporting unit exceeded its fair value, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows. \nThe significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of the Spain reporting until as of December 31, 2023 included the following: \n2023\nTerminal growth rates on cash flows\n2\n%\nWeighted average cost of capital\n7\n%\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment of $\n80.0\n million related to Spain, as discussed further in note 5.\nThere were no other items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nF-38\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n—The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying value reasonably approximates fair value at December 31, 2024 and 2023 include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Company’s estimates of fair value of its long-term obligations, including the current portion, are based primarily upon reported market values. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair value is estimated using either indicative price quotes or a discounted cash flow analysis using rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $\n36.5\n billion and $\n34.6\n billion, respectively, of which $\n31.3\n billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $\n3.3\n billion was measured using Level 2 inputs. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, and amounts presented as discontinued operations, were $\n38.9\n billion and $\n36.7\n billion, respectively, of which $\n30.0\n billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $\n6.7\n billion was measured using Level 2 inputs.\n12.    \nINCOME TAXES \nBeginning in the taxable year ended December 31, 2012, the Company has filed, and intends to continue to file, U.S. federal income tax returns as a REIT, and its domestic TRSs filed, and intend to continue to file, separate tax returns as required. The Company also files tax returns in various states and countries. The Company’s state tax returns reflect different combinations of the Company’s subsidiaries and are dependent on the connection each subsidiary has with a particular state and form of organization. The following information pertains to the Company’s income taxes on a consolidated basis.\nThe income tax provision from continuing operations consisted of the following:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n(\n1.1\n)\n$\n(\n1.0\n)\n$\n(\n6.5\n)\nState\n(\n8.0\n)\n(\n4.9\n)\n(\n5.8\n)\nForeign\n(\n304.9\n)\n(\n253.0\n)\n(\n240.4\n)\nDeferred:\nFederal\n(\n7.6\n)\n1.8\n \n(\n2.8\n)\nState\n(\n1.2\n)\n0.8\n \n0.8\n \nForeign\n(\n43.5\n)\n165.5\n \n141.9\n \nIncome tax provision\n$\n(\n366.3\n)\n$\n(\n90.8\n)\n$\n(\n112.8\n)\nThe effective tax rate (“ETR”) on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, as well as adjustments for state and foreign items. As a REIT, the Company may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by its REIT operations.  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the increase in the income tax provision was primarily attributable to increased earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, partially due to the impacts of the change in estimated useful lives on depreciation and amortization expense as described in note 1 and withholding taxes on equity distributions, including those related to the ATC TIPL Transaction, and management fees from certain foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2024, included the reversal of valuation allowances of $\n20.5\n million in foreign and domestic jurisdictions as compared to the reversal of valuation allowances of $\n87.2\n million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2023 also included a benefit from the application of a tax law change in Kenya.\nF-39\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nReconciliation between the U.S. statutory rate and the effective rate from continuing operations is as follows:\n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStatutory tax rate\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\nAdjustment to reflect REIT status (1)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n21\n)\nForeign taxes\n7\n \n5\n \n4\n \nForeign withholding taxes\n3\n \n4\n \n3\n \nUncertain tax positions\n1\n \n4\n \n2\n \nChanges in tax laws\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \nChanges in valuation allowance\n(\n1\n)\n(\n5\n)\n(\n4\n)\nEffective tax rate\n10\n \n%\n6\n \n%\n5\n \n%\n_______________\n(1)\nAs a result of the ability to utilize the dividends paid deduction to offset the Company’s REIT income and gains.\nThe domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnited States\n$\n1,745.9\n \n$\n1,371.4\n \n$\n1,973.2\n \nForeign\n1,878.9\n \n157.9\n \n112.8\n \nTotal\n$\n3,624.8\n \n$\n1,529.3\n \n$\n2,086.0\n \nThe components of the net deferred tax asset and liability and related valuation allowance were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets:\nOperating lease liability\n$\n900.8\n \n$\n964.2\n \nNet operating loss carryforwards\n212.0\n \n276.4\n \nAccrued asset retirement obligations\n245.6\n \n226.3\n \nStock-based compensation\n9.9\n \n8.5\n \nUnearned revenue\n19.8\n \n35.8\n \nUnrealized loss on foreign currency\n25.6\n \n20.8\n \nOther accruals and allowances\n46.1\n \n40.3\n \nNondeductible interest\n51.6\n \n67.1\n \nTax credits (1)\n311.2\n \n147.3\n \nCapital loss carryforwards (2)\n293.1\n \n175.0\n \nItems not currently deductible and other\n58.6\n \n57.3\n \nLiabilities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n(\n1,566.0\n)\n(\n1,568.0\n)\nRight-of-use asset\n(\n907.0\n)\n(\n978.8\n)\nDeferred rent\n(\n116.3\n)\n(\n122.9\n)\nOther\n(\n42.6\n)\n(\n47.3\n)\nSubtotal\n(\n457.6\n)\n(\n698.0\n)\nValuation allowance\n(\n681.7\n)\n(\n433.5\n)\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$\n(\n1,139.3\n)\n$\n(\n1,131.5\n)\n_______________\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024 includes foreign tax credits determined to be available for use against taxable income.\n(2)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023 includes amounts related to the sale of Mexico Fiber.

Management assesses the available evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances may be reversed if, based on changes in facts and circumstances, the net deferred tax assets have been determined to be realizable.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $\n681.7\n million and $\n433.5\n million, respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2024 is due to uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Company’s ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future, offset by reversals and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for growth.\nA summary of the activity in the valuation allowance is as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance as of January 1,\n$\n433.5\n \n$\n335.7\n \n$\n329.3\n \nAdditions (1)\n305.6\n \n249.1\n \n93.9\n \nUsage, expiration and reversals\n(\n20.5\n)\n(\n87.2\n)\n(\n76.5\n)\nForeign currency translation\n(\n36.9\n)\n(\n64.1\n)\n(\n11.0\n)\nBalance as of December 31,\n$\n681.7\n \n$\n433.5\n \n$\n335.7\n \n \n_______________\n(1)\nIncludes net charges to expense and allowances established due to acquisition and divestitures.\n \nThe recoverability of the Company’s deferred tax assets has been assessed utilizing projections based on its current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, the Company believes that deferred tax assets, other than those for which a valuation allowance has been recorded, will be realized. \nThe Company intends to reinvest foreign earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S., except for earnings in certain entities in Brazil, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Jersey, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda and the United Kingdom. Any tax consequences for future distributions have been recorded as deferred tax liabilities.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had net federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. If not utilized, the Company’s NOLs expire as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\nFederal\nState\nForeign\n2025 to 2029\n$\n0.0\n \n$\n168.7\n \n$\n0.7\n \n2030 to 2034\n0.7\n \n44.0\n \n4.3\n \n2035 to 2039\n66.1\n \n168.0\n \n0.3\n \n2040 to 2044\n—\n \n79.6\n \n8.4\n \nIndefinite carryforward\n331.0\n \n68.6\n \n658.2\n \nTotal\n$\n397.8\n \n$\n528.9\n \n$\n671.9\n \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the ETR, if recognized, is $\n101.3\n million and $\n116.9\n million, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes additions to the Company’s existing tax positions of $\n11.6\n million. \nThe Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from \nzero\n to $\n20.9\n million. \nF-41\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at January 1\n$\n116.9\n \n$\n78.1\n \n$\n67.4\n \nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n3.4\n \n42.4\n \n13.1\n \nAdditions and reductions for tax positions of prior years\n6.9\n \n0.5\n \n18.2\n \nForeign currency\n(\n14.4\n)\n3.9\n \n(\n1.1\n)\nReduction as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations\n(\n2.3\n)\n(\n2.1\n)\n(\n0.6\n)\nReduction as a result of effective settlements\n(\n9.2\n)\n(\n5.9\n)\n(\n18.9\n)\nBalance at December 31\n$\n101.3\n \n$\n116.9\n \n$\n78.1\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions, which resulted in a decrease of $\n12.8\n million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions, which resulted in a decrease of $\n15.5\n million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions, which resulted in a decrease of $\n23.1\n million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense to the tax provision of $\n28.6\n million, $\n21.8\n million and $\n15.9\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions by $\n10.4\n million, $\n9.7\n million and $\n19.9\n million, respectively, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets were $\n58.5\n million and $\n49.1\n million, respectively. \nThe Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December 31, 2024 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company is subject to examination in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Company’s ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or have expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2024.\n13.    \nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION    \nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation Plans\n—The Company maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its directors, officers and employees. The Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”), provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices for non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably. Awards granted prior to March 10, 2023 generally vest over \nfour years\n for RSUs and stock options. In December 2022, the Company’s Compensation Committee changed the terms of its awards to generally vest over \nthree years\n. The change in vesting terms is applicable for new awards granted beginning on March 10, 2023 and does not change the vesting terms applicable to grants awarded prior to March 10, 2023. PSUs generally vest over \nthree years\n. Stock options generally expire \nten years\n from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of \n3.3\n million shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan. In addition, the Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) pursuant to which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a \n15\n% discount from the lower of the closing market value on the first or last day of such offering period. The offering periods run from June 1 through November 30 and from December 1 through May 31 of each year.\nF-42\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded the following stock-based compensation expenses in selling, general, administrative and development expense: \n \n2024 (2)\n2023 (3)\n2022\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n$\n192.7\n \n$\n183.3\n \n$\n161.7\n \n_______________\n(1)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, excludes $\n10.9\n million, $\n12.4\n million, and $\n7.6\n million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to ATC TIPL, which is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n(2)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, includes $\n11.5\n million of accelerated stock-based compensation expense related to unvested and outstanding awards for certain former employees that vested upon termination in accordance with the Company’s severance plan.\n(3)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, excludes $\n7.6\n million of stock-based compensation expense related to severance incurred as part of the Company’s restructuring plan as discussed in note 16 recorded in Other operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nStock Options\n—There were \nno\n options granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Vesting of RSUs is subject generally to the employee’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable RSU award agreement). \nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units—\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) granted an aggregate of \n87,550\n PSUs (the “2024 PSUs”) to its executive officers and established the performance and market metrics for these awards. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s Compensation Committee granted an aggregate of \n118,684\n PSUs (the “2023 PSUs”) and \n98,542\n PSUs (the “2022 PSUs”), respectively, to its executive officers and established the performance metrics for these awards. \nThreshold, target and maximum parameters were established for the metrics for a \nthree-year\n performance period with respect to each of the 2024 PSUs, the 2023 PSUs and the 2022 PSUs and will be used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when each award vests, which may range from \nzero\n to \n200\n% of the target amounts. At the end of each \nthree-year\n performance period, the number of shares that vest will depend on the degree of achievement against the pre-established goals. PSUs will be paid out in common stock at the end of each performance period, subject generally to the executive’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable PSU award agreement). PSUs will accrue dividend equivalents prior to vesting, which will be paid out only in respect of shares that actually vest.\nThe 2024 PSUs include a market condition component based on relative total shareholder return as measured against the REIT constituents included in the S&P 500 Index. For the component of the 2024 PSUs subject to a market condition, fair value is \nF-44\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \ndetermined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. The grant date fair value of the market condition component of the 2024 PSUs is $\n216.11\n.\nKey assumptions used to apply this pricing model were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nExpected term (years)\n2.81\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.31\n \n%\nAnnualized volatility\n26.75\n \n%\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $\n33.7\n million in stock-based compensation expense for equity awards in which the performance goals have been established and were probable of being achieved. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards at December 31, 2024 was $\n4.4\n million based on the Company’s current assessment of the probability of achieving the performance goals. The weighted-average period over which the cost will be recognized is less than \none year\n.  \nATC TIPL Transaction\n— Upon completion of the ATC TIPL Transaction, RSUs granted to certain employees in India that were unvested and outstanding immediately vested. The Company recognized $\n5.3\n million of accelerated stock-based compensation expense for these awards during the year ended December 31, 2024, which is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes.\n14.    \nEQUITY  \nDividends\n—The Company may pay dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock. \nSales of Equity Securities\n—The Company receives proceeds from sales of its equity securities pursuant to the ESPP and upon exercise of stock options granted under the 2007 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company received an aggregate of $\n46.4\n million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. \nStock Repurchase Programs\n—In March 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $\n1.5\n billion of its common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). In December 2017, the Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $\n2.0\n billion of its common stock (the “2017 Buyback,” and, together with the 2011 Buyback, the “Buyback Programs”).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n repurchases under either of the Buyback Programs. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has repurchased a total of \n14,451,325\n shares of its common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $\n1.5\n billion, including commissions and fees. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has \nnot\n made any repurchases under the 2017 Buyback.\nUnder the Buyback Programs, the Company is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, the Company may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows the Company to repurchase shares during periods when it may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. \nThe Company expects to fund any further repurchases of its common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under its credit facilities. Repurchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to, among other things, the Company having available cash to fund the repurchases.\nF-45\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nDistributions\n—\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company declared the following cash distributions (per share data reflects actual amounts):    \nFor the year ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nDistribution\nper share\nAggregate\nPayment  Amount\nDistribution\nper share\nAggregate\nPayment  Amount\nDistribution\nper share\nAggregate\nPayment  Amount\nCommon Stock\n$\n6.48\n \n$\n3,027.3\n \n$\n6.45\n \n$\n3,006.7\n \n$\n5.86\n \n$\n2,715.3\n \nThe following table characterizes the tax treatment of distributions declared per share of common stock. \nFor the year ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nPer Share\n%\nPer Share\n%\nPer Share\n%\nCommon Stock\nOrdinary dividend\n$\n6.5600\n \n100.00\n \n%\n$\n6.3100\n \n100.00\n \n%\n$\n4.3000\n \n100.00\n \n%\nCapital gains distribution\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n6.5600\n \n(1)\n100.00\n \n%\n$\n6.3100\n \n(2)\n100.00\n \n%\n$\n4.3000\n \n(3)\n100.00\n \n%\n_______________\n(1)    Excludes dividend declared on December 5, 2024 of $\n1.62\n per share, which was paid on February 3, 2025 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 27, 2024 and which will apply to the 2025 tax year.

In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  \nVerizon Transaction\n—In March 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with various operating entities of Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) that currently provides for the lease, sublease or management of approximately \n11,100\n wireless communications sites, which commenced on March 27, 2015. The average term of the lease or sublease for all communications sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately \n28\n years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the leased sites in tranches, subject to the applicable lease, sublease or management rights upon its scheduled expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2034 to 2047, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to the towers in that tranche. The purchase price for each tranche is a fixed amount stated in the lease for such tranche plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related towers. The aggregate purchase option price for the towers leased and subleased is approximately $\n5.0\n billion. Verizon will occupy the sites as a tenant for an initial term of \nten years\n with \neight\n optional successive \nfive-year\n terms; each such term shall be governed by standard master lease agreement terms established as a part of the transaction.  \nAT&T Transaction\n—The Company has an agreement with SBC Communications Inc., a predecessor entity to AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), that currently provides for the lease or sublease of approximately \n1,700\n towers, which commenced between December 2000 and August 2004. Substantially all of the towers are part of the Trust Securitizations. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately \n27\n years, assuming renewals or extensions of \nF-50\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nthe underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the sites subject to the applicable lease or sublease upon its expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the lease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by AT&T. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has purchased an aggregate of approximately \n700\n of the subleased towers which are subject to the applicable agreement, including \n80\n towers purchased during the year ended December 31, 2024 for an aggregate purchase price of $\n59.1\n million. The aggregate purchase option price for the remaining towers leased and subleased is $\n1.2\n billion and includes per annum accretion through the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. For all such sites, AT&T has the right to continue to lease the reserved space through June 30, 2025 at the then-current monthly fee, which shall escalate in accordance with the standard master lease agreement for the remainder of AT&T’s tenancy. Thereafter, AT&T shall have the right to renew such lease for up to \nfive\n successive \nfive-year\n terms.\nOther Contingencies\n—The Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it holds assets or operates, and periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments or other actions by taxing authorities. Taxing authorities may issue notices or assessments while audits are being conducted. In certain jurisdictions, taxing authorities may issue assessments with minimal examination. These notices and assessments do not represent amounts that the Company is obligated to pay and are often not reflective of the actual tax liability for which the Company will ultimately be liable. In the process of responding to assessments of taxes that the Company believes are not enforceable, the Company avails itself of both administrative and judicial remedies. The Company evaluates the circumstances of each notification or assessment based on the information available and, in those instances in which the Company does not anticipate a successful defense of positions taken in its tax filings, a liability is recorded in the appropriate amount based on the underlying assessment. \nGuaranties and Indemnifications\n—The Company enters into agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it agrees to guarantee or indemnify third parties for certain claims. The Company has also entered into purchase and sale or disposal agreements relating to the sale or acquisition of assets containing customary indemnification provisions. The Company’s indemnification obligations under these agreements generally are limited solely to damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or covenants under the applicable agreements. In addition, payments under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to whatever defenses the Company may have and are governed by dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular agreement. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in duration and amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for payments made by the Company. The Company has not historically made any material payments under these agreements and, as of December 31, 2024, is not aware of any agreements that could result in a material payment.\n19.    \nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nSupplemental cash flow information and non-cash investing and financing activities are as follows for the years ended December 31,:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSupplemental cash flow information:\nCash paid for interest\n$\n1,424.3\n \n$\n1,260.0\n \n$\n1,088.6\n \nCash paid for income taxes (net of refunds of $\n31.8\n, $\n31.5\n and $\n33.9\n, respectively)\n350.8\n \n306.5\n \n322.3\n \nNon-cash investing and financing activities:\n(Decrease) increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities\n(\n2.9\n)\n(\n14.7\n)\n27.2\n \nPurchases of property and equipment under finance leases, perpetual easements and capital leases\n21.7\n \n31.5\n \n33.6\n \nSettlement of third-party debt\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n7.4\n)\nDistributions to noncontrolling interest holders\n(\n49.9\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nContributions from noncontrolling interest holders\n49.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \nContribution to equity method investment\n14.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTransfer of tower sites (1)\n35.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n_______________\n(1)\nThe Company received \n575\n tower sites from a customer in Brazil in exchange for settling certain future contractual obligations owed to the Company in accordance with the customer’s judicial recovery plan.\nF-51\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \n20.    \nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nProperty\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its operating and reportable segments. The Company’s Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) property segment and Africa property segment were combined into the Africa & APAC property segment. As a result, the Company now has \nsix\n reportable segments: U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company’s data center facilities and related assets), Africa & APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. The change in operating and reportable segments had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. \nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in \nseven\n segments: U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\nCommunications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure\n—The Company’s primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis.\nData Centers\n— The Company operates \n29\n data center facilities across \nten\n markets in the United States. The Company’s Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different types of leased land and related services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the existing property operating segment in the U.S. & Canada. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company’s property operations consisted of the following:\n•\nU.S. & Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n•\nAfrica & APAC: property operations in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Uganda;\n•\nEurope: property operations in France, Germany and Spain;\n•\nLatin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n•\nData Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\nServices\n—The Company’s Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. The Company’s definition of segment operating profit aligns with the Company’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved. \nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) is the Company’s chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit to evaluate the segments’ operating performance, in making capital allocation decisions, and in establishing management’s compensation. Additionally, the CODM uses these metrics to monitor \nF-52\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nbudget versus actual results. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company’s operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets.\nSummarized financial information concerning the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is shown in the following tables. The “Other” column (i) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other income (expense), and (ii) reconciles segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes.\nF-53\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \n \nProperty\nTotal \nProperty\nServices\nOther\nTotal\nYear ended December 31, 2024\nU.S. & Canada\nAfrica & APAC (1)\nEurope\nLatin America\nData Centers\nSegment revenues\n$\n5,248.1\n \n$\n1,208.0\n \n$\n834.7\n \n$\n1,717.9\n \n$\n924.8\n \n$\n9,933.5\n \n$\n193.7\n \n$\n10,127.2\n \nSegment operating expenses\n870.9\n \n380.5\n \n309.4\n \n530.2\n \n390.8\n \n2,481.8\n \n92.6\n \n2,574.4\n \nSegment gross margin\n4,377.2\n \n827.5\n \n525.3\n \n1,187.7\n \n534.0\n \n7,451.7\n \n101.1\n \n7,552.8\n \nSegment selling, general, administrative and development expense (2)\n161.1\n \n68.0\n \n64.8\n \n111.0\n \n78.8\n \n483.7\n \n21.0\n \n504.7\n \nSegment operating profit\n$\n4,216.1\n \n$\n759.5\n \n$\n460.5\n \n$\n1,076.7\n \n$\n455.2\n \n$\n6,968.0\n \n$\n80.1\n \n$\n7,048.1\n \nStock-based compensation expense\n$\n192.7\n \n192.7\n \nOther selling, general, administrative and development expense\n236.0\n \n236.0\n \nDepreciation, amortization and accretion\n2,028.8\n \n2,028.8\n \nOther expense (3)\n965.8\n \n965.8\n \nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes \n$\n3,624.8\n \nCapital expenditures (4) (5) (6)\n$\n318.6\n \n$\n260.9\n \n$\n249.6\n \n$\n174.2\n \n$\n545.0\n \n$\n1,548.3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n67.5\n \n$\n1,615.8\n \n_______________\n(1)\nExcludes the operating results of ATC TIPL, which are reported as discontinued operations.

The strategic review concluded in January 2024 with the signed agreement for the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined below). \nOn January 4, 2024, the Company, through ATC TIPL, entered into an agreement with Data Infrastructure Trust (“DIT”), an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management, pursuant to which DIT agreed to acquire a \n100\n% ownership interest in ATC TIPL (the “ATC TIPL Transaction”). Per the terms of the agreement, total aggregate consideration represented up to approximately \n210\n billion Indian Rupees (“INR”) (approximately $\n2.5\n billion), including the value of the VIL OCDs and the VIL Shares (each as defined and further discussed in note 11), payments on certain existing customer receivables, the repayment of existing intercompany debt and the repayment, or assumption, of the Company’s existing term loan in India, by DIT. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, ATC TIPL distributed approximately \n29.6\n billion INR (approximately $\n354.1\n million) to the Company, which included the value of the VIL Shares and the VIL OCDs and the satisfaction \nof the economic benefit associated with the rights to payments on certain existing customer receivables. The distributions\n were deducted from the total aggregate consideration received by the Company at closing. \nThe ATC TIPL Transaction received all government and regulatory approvals during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and on September 12, 2024, the Company completed the sale of ATC TIPL and received total consideration of \n182\n billion INR (approximately $\n2.2\n billion). The Company used the proceeds from the ATC TIPL Transaction to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility. \nThe Company recorded a loss on the sale of ATC TIPL of $\n1.2\n billion, which primarily included the reclassification of the Company’s cumulative translation adjustment in India upon exiting the market of $\n1.1\n billion. \nThe loss on sale of ATC TIPL is included in  Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for year ended December 31, 2024. \nProceeds received at closing\n$\n2,158.8\n \nNet assets at closing\n(\n2,257.6\n)\nLoss on sale\n$\n(\n98.8\n)\nDeal costs\n(\n20.5\n)\nContingent liability for tax indemnification\n(\n53.9\n)\nReclassification of cumulative translation adjustment\n(\n1,072.3\n)\nTotal loss on sale included in loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n$\n(\n1,245.5\n)\nUnder the terms of the Company’s agreement with DIT, the Company is obligated to indemnify DIT with respect to certain tax-related liabilities that may arise from activities prior to the completion of the sale. The Company has recorded a $\n53.9\n million contingent indemnification liability related to uncertain tax positions taken by ATC TIPL prior to the completion of the sale. The contingent indemnification liability is recorded in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company recorded a deferred tax asset related to the loss incurred on the sale of ATC TIPL which can only be utilized against future nonresident long-term India capital gains earned by ATC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from this will not be realized and has recorded a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset of approximately $\n140\n million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, ATC TIPL represented approximately \n23\n%, \n15\n% and \n15\n%, respectively, of the Company’s international property revenue, international gross margin and international operating profit and \n10\n%, \n6\n% and \n5\n%, respectively, of the Company’s total property revenue, total segment gross margin and total segment operating profit. Prior to the completion of the ATC TIPL Transaction, ATC TIPL represented approximately \n42\n% of the Company’s international communications sites and \n34\n% of the Company’s total communications sites. The Company believes that the sale of ATC TIPL represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on its operations and financial results, and as such, the divestiture qualified for presentation as discontinued operations. Prior to the divestiture and classification as discontinued operations, ATC TIPL’s operating results were included within the Asia-Pacific property segment. Accordingly, the operating results of ATC TIPL are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. \nF-58\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nAssets of discontinued operations consisted of the following:   \nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n—\n \n$\n219.6\n \nRestricted cash\n—\n \n0.4\n \nAccounts receivable, net\n—\n \n122.2\n \nPrepaid and other current assets (1)\n—\n \n387.4\n \nTotal current assets of discontinued operations\n$\n—\n \n$\n729.6\n \nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n—\n \n$\n925.6\n \nGoodwill\n—\n \n555.5\n \nOther intangible assets, net\n—\n \n588.4\n \nDeferred rent\n—\n \n43.6\n \nRight-of-use asset\n—\n \n673.7\n \nNotes receivable and other non-current assets\n34.1\n \nTotal non-current assets of discontinued operations\n$\n—\n \n$\n2,820.9\n \nTotal assets of discontinued operations\n$\n—\n \n$\n3,550.5\n \n_______________\n(1)    As of December 31, 2023, includes the VIL OCDs.\nLiabilities of discontinued operations consisted of the following:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAccounts payable\n$\n—\n \n$\n7.4\n \nAccrued expenses\n—\n \n227.8\n \nAccrued interest\n—\n \n2.8\n \nCurrent portion of operating lease liability\n—\n \n104.2\n \nCurrent portion of long-term obligations\n—\n \n120.2\n \nUnearned revenue\n—\n \n0.9\n \nTotal current liabilities of discontinued operations\n$\n—\n \n$\n463.3\n \nOperating lease liability\n—\n \n623.4\n \nAsset retirement obligation\n—\n \n78.2\n \nDeferred tax liability\n—\n \n50.8\n \nOther non-current liabilities\n—\n \n70.8\n \nTotal non-current liabilities of discontinued operations\n$\n—\n \n$\n823.2\n \nTotal liabilities of discontinued operations\n$\n—\n \n$\n1,286.5\n \nCurrent portion of long-term obligations—\nLong-term obligations, including the current portion, includes the India Term Loan (as defined below).

In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to the Company beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to the Company, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. In the second half of 2023, VIL began making payments in full of its monthly contractual obligations owed to the Company.\nThe Company considered these developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under its tenant leases when conducting its 2022 annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets in India. A probability weighted assessment was performed, incorporating current and expected industry and market conditions and trends and, as a result, the Company determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n•\nAn impairment of $\n97.0\n million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India. \n•\nThe Company also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $\n411.6\n million.\nGoodwill Impairments \nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, as further discussed in note 1. \nThe Company concluded that a triggering event occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to its India reporting unit primarily due to indications of value received from third parties in connection with the Company’s review of various strategic alternatives for its India operations, \nwhich concluded in the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined in note 22)\n. As a result, the Company performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023, using, among other things, the information obtained from third parties to compare the estimated fair value of the India reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The result of the Company’s interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023 \nF-60\nTable of Contents\n \nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) \nindicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n322.0\n million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. \nThe cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been segregated and are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \nThe following table presents key cash flow and non-cash information related to discontinued operations: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 (1)\n2023\n2022\nProceeds from the sale of ATC TIPL\n$\n2,158.8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nCapital expenditures\n(\n52.3\n)\n(\n111.9\n)\n(\n123.0\n)\nSignificant non-cash items:\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion\n96.0\n \n158.0\n \n190.2\n \nStock-based compensation expense\n10.9\n \n12.4\n \n7.6\n \nImpairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, non-cash restructuring and merger related expenses\n(\n2.3\n)\n318.2\n \n500.3\n \n(Gain) loss on investments, unrealized foreign currency (gain) loss and other non-cash expense\n(\n30.7\n)\n(\n82.5\n)\n14.0\n \nLoss on sale of ATC TIPL (2)\n1,245.5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n_______________\n(1)\nIncludes the cash flows for ATC TIPL through September 12, 2024.\n(2)\nPrimarily includes the reclassification of the Company’s cumulative translation adjustment in India upon exiting the market of $\n1.1\n billion.\nTransition Services Agreement—\nIn connection with the ATC TIPL Transaction, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the “TSA”) with DIT, pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide certain information technology, finance, accounting and human resources services to support DIT in the ongoing operation of the business for a period of time post-closing.
