Net income for common stock for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes $(46) million (after-tax) for adjustments related to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X to the financial statements in Item 8.\nInflation Reduction Act\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law and implemented a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) that imposes a 15 percent tax on modified GAAP net income. Under the IRA, a corporation is subject to the CAMT if its average annual adjusted financial statement income for the three taxable year period ending prior to the taxable year exceeds $1,000 million, and applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. \nPursuant to the IRA, corporations are entitled to a tax credit (minimum tax credit) to the extent the CAMT liability exceeds the regular tax liability. This amount can be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years when regular tax exceeds the CAMT.\nBeginning in 2024, based on the existing statue, the Companies are subject to and report the CAMT in their Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companies accrued a CAMT liability of $139 million, $111 million of which is for CECONY, before the application of general business credits with an offsetting deferred tax asset representing the minimum tax credit carryforward, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Companies are continuing to assess the impacts of the IRA on their financial statements and will update estimates based on future guidance to be issued by the Department of the Treasury.\nNew York Legislation\nIn April 2021, New York passed a law that increased the corporate franchise tax rate on business income from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent, retroactive to January 1, 2021, for taxpayers with taxable income greater than $5 million. The law also reinstated the business capital tax at 0.1875 percent, not to exceed a maximum tax liability of $5 million per taxpayer. New York requires a corporate franchise taxpayer to calculate and pay the highest amount of tax under the three alternative methods: a tax on business income; a tax on business capital; or a fixed dollar minimum. The provisions to increase the corporate franchise tax rate and reinstate a capital tax were scheduled to expire after 2023. In May 2023, New York passed a law that extended the increase in the corporate franchise tax rate from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent for an additional three years, through tax year 2026 and extended the business capital tax through tax year 2026.  New York also passed a law establishing a permanent rate of 30 percent for the metropolitan transportation business tax surcharge. As a result of the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses in 2023, Con Edison's New York State taxable income was higher than $5 million and subject to the higher 7.25 percent rate (9.425 percent with the surcharge rate) on its taxable income for tax year 2023, but is not subject to the higher rate in tax year 2024.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n57\n                      \nResults of Operations\nNet income for common stock and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars,\nexcept per share amounts)\nNet Income for\nCommon Stock\nEarnings per Share\n  \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCECONY\n$1,748\n$1,606\n$5.05 \n$4.62 \nO&R\n104\n96\n0.30 \n0.28 \nClean Energy Businesses (a)\n—\n22\n— \n0.07 \nCon Edison Transmission (b)\n45\n37\n0.13 \n0.11 \nOther (c)\n(77)\n758\n(0.22)\n2.17 \nCon Edison (d)\n$1,820\n$2,519\n$5.26\n \n$7.25\n \n(a)\nNet income for common stock and earnings per share from the Clean Energy Businesses for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects\n $2 million or $0.01 a share (after-tax) of the effects of HLBV accounting for tax equity investments in certain renewable electric projects.

Effective November 1, 2023, revenues from CECONY’s steam sales are also subject to a weather normalization clause, as a result of which, delivery revenues reflect normal weather conditions during the heating season. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying \nenergy to their full-service customers. Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect Con Edison’s results of operations.\nb.    On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses and therefore 2023 reflects the financial results for the two months ended February 2023.\nc.

See \"Interest Rate Risk,\" below, \"Aged Accounts Receivable Balances,\" above and \"Capital Resources,\" below.\nCon Edison and the Utilities have a $2,500 million revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2029, unless extended for an additional one-year term, subject to certain conditions. CECONY has a $500 million 364-day revolving credit agreement (the CECONY Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2025, subject to certain conditions. Con Edison and the Utilities have not entered into any loans under the Credit Agreement and CECONY has not entered into any loans under the CECONY Credit Agreement.\nIn November 2024 and January 2025, CECONY borrowed $500 million and $200 million, respectively, at a variable\nrate under a 364-Day Senior Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement entered into by the company in November 2024 (the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement). The term loans mature in November 2025.\nCECONY has the option to prepay the term loans issued under the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement prior to\nmaturity. \nFERC has authorized CECONY through April 30, 2026 and O&R through July 31, 2026 to issue short-term borrowings for a period of not more than 12 months, in an amount not to exceed $4,000 million and $250 million, respectively, at prevailing market rates.\nThe Companies’ liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below.\nThe principal factors affecting Con Edison’s liquidity are its investments in the Utilities and Con Edison Transmission, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.\nThe principal factors affecting CECONY’s liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including capital expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.\nThe Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities’ cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.\nEach of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements.
