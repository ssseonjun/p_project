    "item1": "Item 1. “Business” for a description of our reportable segments.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we implemented changes to our Principal Asset Management segment to align the global operations by business function. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2024, our Principal Asset Management segment was organized into Principal Global Investors and Principal International. The Principal Asset Management segment is now organized into Investment Management and International Pension. The change has been applied retrospectively, which did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nEconomic Factors and Trends\nPositive market performance led to an increase in account values in our Retirement and Income Solutions segment in 2024. Since account values are the base by which this business generates revenues, market performance volatility may impact our revenues in future quarters.\nPositive market performance led to an increase in AUM in our Principal Asset Management segment in 2024, which was partially offset by foreign currency headwinds. Since AUM is the base by which this business generates revenues, market performance and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact our revenues in future quarters. Also included in revenues are borrower fees, transaction fees and performance fees, which can fluctuate between years.\nIn our Benefits and Protection segment, premium and fee growth is a key indicator of earnings growth. Higher levels of unemployment may impact new sales in our businesses and reduce in-group growth in our Specialty Benefits business in the short-term.\n​\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\nProfitability\nOur profitability depends in large part upon our amount of AUM and our ability to:\n●\nmanage the difference between the investment income we earn and the interest we credit to policyholders;\n●\ngenerate fee revenues by providing trust and custody, administrative and investment management services;\n●\nprice our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the related expenses;\n●\nmanage our investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes or defaults or impairments of invested assets;\n●\neffectively hedge fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates on certain transactions and\n●\nmanage our operating expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance requires us to closely monitor our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.” We have identified critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance the reader’s ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates and changes in guidance. The identification, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Board Audit Committee.\nValuation and Allowance for Credit Loss of Fixed Income Investments\nFixed Maturities.\n Fixed maturities include bonds, asset-backed securities (“ABS”), redeemable preferred stock and certain non-redeemable preferred securities. We classify our fixed maturities as either AFS or trading and, accordingly, carry them at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. Volatility in net income can result from changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as trading. Volatility in other comprehensive income can result from changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as AFS.\nWe measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset, or nonperformance risk, including our own credit risk. For additional details concerning the methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” under the caption, “Determination of Fair Value.”\nThe fair values of our public fixed maturities are primarily based on market prices from third party pricing vendors. We have regular interactions with these vendors to ensure we understand their pricing methodologies and to confirm they are utilizing observable market information. In addition, 16% of our invested asset portfolio as of December 31, 2024, was invested in privately placed fixed maturities with no readily available market quotes to determine the fair market value. The majority of these assets are valued using a matrix pricing valuation approach that utilizes observable market inputs. In the matrix approach, securities are grouped into pricing categories that vary by sector, rating and average life. Each pricing category is assigned a risk spread based on observable public market data. The expected cash flows of the security are then discounted back at the current Treasury curve plus the appropriate risk spread. Although the matrix valuation approach provides a fair valuation of each pricing category, the valuation of an individual security within each pricing category may be impacted by company specific factors. This excludes privately placed securities subject to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933 that are primarily based on market prices from third party pricing vendors, similar to public fixed maturities.\nIf we are unable to price a fixed maturity security using prices from third party pricing vendors or other sources specific to the asset class, we may obtain a broker quote or utilize an internal pricing model specific to the asset utilizing relevant market information, to the extent available and where at least one significant unobservable input is utilized. In addition, there may be certain securities managed by external managers where we obtain the valuation from the external manager when we are unable to obtain prices from third party pricing vendors or other sources. These are reflected in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and can include fixed maturities across all asset classes. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 3% of our total fixed maturities were Level 3 securities valued using internal pricing models. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further discussion.\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe $227.0 million increase in net unrealized losses from U.S. investment operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, can primarily be attributed to an increase in interest rates, which was partially offset by a tightening of credit spreads. For additional information about interest rate risk see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nWe have a process in place to identify fixed maturity securities that could potentially require an allowance for credit loss. This process involves monitoring market events that could impact issuers’ credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions and other similar factors. This process also involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels, downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.\nEach reporting period, all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine whether a decline in value is due to credit. Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent the fair value is below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events and (4) for structured securities, the adequacy of the expected cash flows. To the extent we determine an unrealized loss is due to credit, an allowance for credit loss is recognized through a reduction to net income. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Allowance for Credit Loss” for further discussion.\nA number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit losses and determining the allowance for credit loss. These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer’s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer; (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated; (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. Any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period. As of December 31, 2024, we had $46,367.3 million in AFS fixed maturities with gross unrealized losses totaling $6,475.2 million. Included in the gross unrealized losses are losses attributable to both movements in market interest rates as well as movement in credit spreads.\nFor more detailed information concerning allowances for credit loss, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Allowance for Credit Loss.”\nMortgage Loans.\n Mortgage loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loans on real estate. Commercial mortgage loans on real estate are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. We establish a valuation allowance for the risk of credit losses inherent in our mortgage loans, which is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated expected credit losses. The valuation allowance is based on amortized cost excluding accrued interest receivable and includes reserves for pools of financing receivables with similar risk characteristics. Amounts on loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and removed from the valuation allowance. The change in the valuation allowance provision is included in net realized capital gains (losses) on our consolidated statements of operations.\nFor more detailed information concerning mortgage loan valuation allowances, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Financing Receivables Valuation Allowance.”\nDerivatives\nWe use derivatives primarily to hedge or reduce exposure to market risks. The fair values of exchange-traded derivatives are determined through quoted market prices. Exchange-traded derivatives include futures that are settled daily, which reduces their fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. The fair values of privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, that are cleared through centralized clearinghouses are determined through market prices published by the clearinghouses. Variation margin associated with OTC cleared derivatives is settled daily, which reduces their fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. The fair values of non-cleared OTC derivatives are determined using either pricing valuation models that utilize market observable inputs or broker quotes. On an absolute fair value basis as of December 31, 2024, the majority of our OTC derivative assets and liabilities were valued using pricing valuation models using market observable data with approximately 3% using broker quotes. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further discussion. The fair values of our derivative instruments can be impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity indices and volatility, as well as other contributing factors. For additional information see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe also issue certain annuity, universal life and other contracts that include embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated from the host contract. They are valued using a combination of historical data and actuarial judgment. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further discussion. We include our assumption for own nonperformance risk in the valuation of these embedded derivatives. As our credit spreads widen or tighten, the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities decrease or increase, leading to an increase or decrease in net income. If the current market credit spreads reflecting our own creditworthiness move to zero (tighten), the reduction to net income would be approximately $35.1 million, net of income taxes, based on December 31, 2024, reported amounts. In addition, the policyholder behavior assumptions used in the valuation of embedded derivatives include risk margins, which increase the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities.\nWe have entered into coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance arrangements. For funds withheld agreements the economic benefit of the assets flow to reinsurance counterparties, however, we retain legal ownership of the assets within the funds withheld account. Therefore, the assets held under funds withheld agreements are included on our consolidated statements of financial position, with a corresponding funds withheld payable. The funds withheld payable also includes an embedded derivative that has been bifurcated from the host contract. The fair value of the embedded derivative is based on the change in the fair value of the underlying funds withheld investments using the valuation methods and assumptions described for our investments held.\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the applicable accounting standards continue to evolve. Judgment is applied in determining the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment. Judgment and estimates are used to determine the fair value of some of our derivatives. Volatility in net income can result from changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting and changes in fair value of embedded derivatives.\nMarket Risk Benefits\nMRBs are contracts or contract features that provide protection to the policyholder from capital market risk such as equity, interest rate or foreign exchange risk and expose us to other-than-nominal capital market risk. We have certain annuity and other investment contracts that have GMWB and GMDB riders or a guarantee on the minimum account balance under certain qualifying events. These MRBs have been bifurcated from the host contract and are measured at fair value. The change in fair value is recognized in net income, with the exception of the change in fair value related to our own nonperformance risk, which is recognized in OCI. We use various derivative instruments to hedge against changes in fair value of MRBs related to market risk.\nMRBs are valued using a combination of historical data and actuarial judgment. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11, Market Risk Benefits and Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further discussion. We include our assumption for own nonperformance risk in the valuation of these MRBs, which is based on the current market credit spreads for debt-like instruments we have issued and are available in the market. As our credit spreads widen or tighten, the fair value of MRB assets increase or decrease and the fair value of MRB liabilities decrease or increase, leading to an increase or decrease in OCI, respectively. If the current market credit spreads reflecting our own creditworthiness move to zero (tighten), the reduction to OCI would be approximately $42.0 million, net of income taxes, based on December 31, 2024, reported amounts. In addition, the policyholder behavior assumptions used in the valuation of MRBs include risk margins, which decrease the fair value of MRB assets and increase the fair value of MRB liabilities.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangibles with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We formally conduct our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing during the third quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not create an impairment. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment.\nAnnual goodwill impairment testing consists of qualitative or quantitative assessments. In the qualitative assessment, we assess relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. If when reviewing the qualitative factors it is determined it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe determination of fair value for our reporting units is primarily based on an income approach whereby we use discounted cash flows for each reporting unit. We apply significant judgment to our discounted cash flow models when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will in all likelihood differ in some responses from actual future results.\nThe key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value include:\n●\nweighted average cost of capital\n●\nlong-term growth rate\n●\ncorporate income tax rate\n●\nAUM growth rate\n●\nnet revenue growth rate\n●\nbusiness margins on AUM and net revenue\nFor reporting units that performed a qualitative test of goodwill, we concluded the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired. Similarly, for reporting units that performed a quantitative test of goodwill, the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.\nFor information about our goodwill and other intangible assets, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies,” and “Note 2, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”\nSensitivities.\n In connection with our annual impairment testing process, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. We cannot predict certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets that totaled $1,549.7 million and $1,389.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, interest rate movements, declines in the equity markets, the legal environment in which the businesses operate or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers.\nInsurance Reserves\nReserves are liabilities representing estimates of the amounts that will come due, at some point in the future, to or on behalf of our policyholders. U.S. GAAP, allowing for some degree of managerial judgment, provides guidance for establishing reserves.\nFuture policy benefits and claims include reserves for individual traditional life insurance, disability insurance and individual and group annuities that provide periodic income payments. These reserves are computed using assumptions of mortality, interest, morbidity and lapse. These assumptions are based on our experience, industry results, emerging trends and future expectations.\nFor long-duration insurance contracts, reserves for individual and group annuities are generally equal to the present value of expected future policy benefit payments, while the reserves for non-participating term life insurance and individual disability income contracts is generally equal to the present value of expected future policy benefits less the present value of expected net premiums. Issue-year cohorts are used for the reserve calculation and assumptions are periodically reviewed and updated. Separate cohorts are used for the calculation of ceded reserves. An interest accretion rate is determined for an identified cohort and remains unchanged after the issue year. Reserves are remeasured as of each reporting date to reflect the current upper-medium grade fixed income instruments yields, with the impact reported in OCI. If the current upper-medium grade yields decrease 100 basis points, the reduction in OCI would be approximately $2.2 billion, net of income taxes, based on December 31, 2024, reported amounts.\nReserves for participating life insurance contracts are based on the net level premium reserve for death and endowment policy benefits. This net level premium reserve is calculated based on dividend fund interest rates and mortality rates guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in the contract.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor short-duration contracts, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. Our reserve levels are reviewed throughout the year using internal analysis including, among other things, experience studies, claim development analysis and annual loss recognition analysis. To the extent experience indicates potential loss recognition, we recognize losses on certain lines of business. The ultimate accuracy of the assumptions on these insurance products cannot be determined until the obligation of the entire block of business on which the assumptions were made is extinguished. Short-term variances of actual results from the assumptions used in the computation of the reserves are reflected in current period net income and can impact quarter-to-quarter net income.\nFuture policy benefits and claims also include reserves for incurred but unreported disability claims. We recognize claims costs in the period the service was provided to our policyholders. However, claims costs incurred in a particular period are not known with certainty until after we receive, process and pay the claims. We determine the amount of this liability using actuarial methods based on historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging cost trends, where applicable, to determine our estimate of claim liabilities. We also look back to assess how our prior periods’ estimates developed. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period claim expense. Historically, the amount of the claim reserve adjustment made in subsequent reporting periods for prior period estimates have been within a reasonable range given our normal claim fluctuations.\nFuture policy benefits and claims also include benefit reserves that are established for universal life-type contracts that provide benefit features that are expected to produce gains in early years followed by losses in later years. The liabilities are accrued in relation to estimated contract assessments.\nSee Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10, Future Policy Benefits and Claims” for further discussion.\nWe periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are used to project cash flows that are used to compute reserves. For more information see ‘‘Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations — Actuarial Assumption Updates.”\nBenefit Plans\nThe reported expense and liability associated with pension plans requires the use of assumptions. Numerous assumptions are made regarding the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, turnover, expected compensation increases, retirement rates and mortality. The discount rate and the expected return on plan assets have the most significant impact on the level of expense.\nThe assumed discount rate is determined by projecting future benefit payments inherent in the Projected Benefit Obligation and discounting those cash flows using a spot yield curve for high quality corporate bonds. Our assumed discount rate was 5.50% for our pension plans as of December 31, 2024. Typically, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension benefits Projected Benefit Obligation by approximately $84.8 million and increase the Net Periodic Pension Cost (“NPPC”) by approximately $6.1 million. Typically, a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease in the benefit obligation and expense at a level generally commensurate with those noted above.\nThe assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is set at the long-term rate expected to be earned based on the long-term investment policy of the plans and the various classes of the invested funds. Historical and future expected returns of multiple asset classes were analyzed to develop a risk-free real rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class. The overall long-term rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term inflation component, the real risk-free rate of return and the associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was developed based on long-term returns for each asset class, the plan’s target asset allocation policy and the tax structure of the trusts. For the 2024 NPPC, a 6.10% weighted average long-term rate of return was used. For the 2025 NPPC, a 6.40% weighted average long-term rate of return assumption will be used. Typically, a 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return would increase the NPPC by approximately $6.7 million. Typically, a 0.25% increase in this rate would result in a decrease to expense at the same levels. The assumed return on plan assets is based on the fair market value of plan assets as of December 31, 2024.\nThe compensation increase assumption is generally set at a rate consistent with current and expected long-term compensation and salary policy, including inflation. \nFor pension costs, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line amortization method over the average remaining service period of plan participants, which is approximately 10 years. The qualified pension plan does not utilize the allowable corridor, while the nonqualified pension plans utilize the 10% corridor. Prior service costs are amortized on a weighted average basis over approximately 4 years for pension costs. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15, Employee and Agent Benefits” for further discussion.\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for income taxes based on our estimate of the liability for taxes due. Our tax accounting represents management’s best estimate of various events and transactions, such as completion of tax audits or establishment of, or changes to, a valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets, which could affect our estimates and effective income tax rate in a particular quarter or annual period. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. We are required to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realizable. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies management would employ to realize the tax benefit.\nDeferred income taxes (including federal, state and foreign withholding) have not been provided on approximately $1,276.3 million of accumulated but undistributed earnings from operations of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024. We do not record deferred income taxes on foreign earnings not expected to be distributed to the U.S. We apply an exception to the general rule, which under U.S. GAAP otherwise requires the recording of deferred income taxes on the anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings as recognized for financial reporting purposes. The exception permits us to not record a deferred income tax liability on foreign earnings we expect to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations. The related deferred income taxes will be recorded in the period it becomes apparent we can no longer positively assert some or all the undistributed earnings will remain invested into the foreseeable future.\nThe amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits in the U.S. as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized for book purposes when the more-likely-than-not threshold is met with regard to the validity of an uncertain tax position. Once this threshold is met, for each uncertain tax position we recognize in earnings the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the Internal Revenue Service or other income taxing authorities for audits ongoing or not yet commenced. We do not anticipate the ultimate resolution of audits ongoing or not yet commenced to have a material impact on our net income.\nSee Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Income Taxes” for further discussion.\nRecent Event\nPrincipal Mandatory Provident Funds\nOn January 16, 2025, we announced the signing of an agreement with BCT to expand our investment management capabilities and exit our sponsor and trustee (pension) roles in Hong Kong for MPF Schemes. BCT will be assuming the role as sponsor and trustee for the Principal MPF Schemes. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory approval, and will be reported within the Principal Asset Management segment. We expect to record a one-time charge of approximately $140.0 million in the first quarter of 2025 primarily attributable to the write-down of certain intangible assets and deferred contract cost assets, which will reduce pre-tax net income. For segment reporting purposes, the charge will be reported as exited business and net realized capital loss from exiting our roles as MPF Scheme sponsor and trustee. As such, it will have no impact on segment pre-tax operating earnings.\nTransactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations\nYearly Renewable Term Reinsurance Transactions\nDuring 2024, we terminated, executed and amended certain YRT reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies for insurance risks associated with universal life insurance in the Benefits and Protection segment, primarily related to ULSG (“YRT Reinsurance Transactions”).\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOther\nActuarial Assumption Updates.\n We periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are inputs to the models for the liability for future policy benefits for traditional limited-payment long-duration contracts and other actuarial balances. Assumption updates, model refinements and other updates made resulted in a change in cash flow assumptions that decreased consolidated net income attributable to Principal Financial Group, Inc. by $78.0 million and $9.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table presents the increase (decrease) to pre-tax operating earnings for each segment.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\n​\n \n(in millions)\nRetirement and Income Solutions\n    \n$\n (16.7)\n​\n$\n 53.4\nPrincipal Asset Management\n​\n​\n 21.1\n​\n​\n —\nBenefits and Protection\n​\n​\n (76.7)\n​\n​\n 9.8\n​\nOther Factors Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations\nFluctuations in Foreign Currency to U.S. Dollar Exchange Rates\nFluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates for locations in which we have operations can affect reported financial results. In years when foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar, translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in fewer U.S. dollars to be reported. When foreign currencies strengthen, translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in more U.S. dollars to be reported.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations create variances in our financial statement line items. The most significant impact occurs within our Principal Asset Management segment where pre-tax operating earnings were negatively impacted $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. This impact was calculated by comparing (a) the difference between current year results and prior year results to (b) the difference between current year results and prior year results translated using current year exchange rates for both periods. We use this approach to calculate the impact of exchange rates on all revenue and expense line items. For a discussion of our approaches to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk, see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk.”\nEffects of Inflation\nThe impact of inflation has not had a material effect on our annual consolidated results of operations over the past two years. However, we may be materially affected by inflation in the future.\nVariable Investment Income\nVariable investment income includes certain types of investment returns such as prepayment fees and income (loss) from certain elements of our other alternative asset classes, including results of value-add real estate sales activity. Due to its unpredictable nature, variable investment income may or may not be material to our financial results for a given reporting period and may create variances when comparing different reporting periods.

This increase was partially offset by a $170.4 million unfavorable one-time impact of the YRT Reinsurance Transactions in 2024.\nTotal Revenues\nPremiums and other considerations increased $201.9 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to higher sales of single premium group annuities with life contingencies. The single premium group annuity product, which is typically used to fund defined benefit plan terminations, can generate large premiums from very few customers and therefore premiums tend to vary from period to period. Premiums and other considerations increased $168.4 million for the Benefits and Protection segment primarily due to growth in the Specialty Benefits business.\nFees and other revenues increased $109.6 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to an increase in fee revenue stemming from an increase in average monthly account values, which largely resulted from more favorable financial markets. Fees and other revenues increased for the Principal Asset Management segment due to $92.7 million higher management fee revenue as a result of increased average AUM managed by our Investment Management operations, which was partially offset by $24.2 million lower performance fee revenue for our Investment Management operations primarily in our real estate business.\nFor net investment income and net realized capital losses variance information, see “Investments — Investment Results” under the captions “Net Investment Income” and “Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses),” respectively.\nNet realized capital gains on funds withheld assets decreased due to lower net gains on sales of funds withheld assets as a result of lower sales in 2024 resulting from less portfolio re-positioning by an external reinsurer.\nThe change in fair value of the funds withheld embedded derivative resulted in a gain in 2024 due primarily to an increase in interest rates as compared to a loss in 2023 due primarily to a tightening of credit spreads.\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTotal Expenses\nBenefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $530.0 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to an increase in reserves, stemming from higher sales of single premium group annuities with life contingencies. Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased $122.0 million for the Benefits and Protection segment due to growth in the Specialty Benefits business. This increase was partially offset by a $345.4 million decrease for the Benefits and Protection segment due to a favorable one-time impact of the YRT Reinsurance Transactions in 2024.\nThe liability for future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss change was primarily due to the unfavorable effect of changes in cash flow assumptions related to a $544.5 million one-time impact of the YRT Reinsurance Transactions in 2024 and a $131.6 million impact driven by actuarial assumption updates and model refinements.\nOperating expenses increased primarily due to a $148.4 million increase in compensation costs, an $85.9 million increase in nondeferrable commission expense and an $81.4 million increase in amounts credited to employee accounts in a nonqualified defined contribution pension plan.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate increased to 15% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 9% for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income with no proportionate change in permanent tax differences. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Income Taxes” under the caption, “Effective Income Tax Rate” for further discussion.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nFor results of operations by segment see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20, Segment Information.”\nRetirement and Income Solutions Segment\nRetirement and Income Solutions Trends\nSeveral key factors impact revenue and earnings growth in the Retirement and Income Solutions segment. These factors include: the ability of our distribution channels to generate new sales and retain existing business; pricing decisions that take account of competitive conditions, persistency, investment returns, mortality trends, and operating expense levels; investment management performance; equity market returns and interest rate changes. Profitability ultimately depends on our ability to price products and invest assets at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring and administering those products.\nNet revenue and average monthly account values are key metrics used to understand Retirement and Income Solutions earnings growth. Net revenue, which is used only at the segment level, is defined as operating revenues less benefits, claims and settlement expenses; liability for future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss; market risk benefit remeasurement (gain) loss and dividends to policyholders. Net revenue is impacted by: (1) changes in the equity markets and interest rates and (2) the difference between investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate credited to the contracts. Average monthly account values include the net balances that customers have accumulated within their account, along with future policy benefits for retirement payout products. Average monthly account values are primarily impacted by net customer cash flows and credit market performance.\nThe following table presents the Retirement and Income Solutions segment net revenue for the years indicated:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n(decrease)\nNet revenue (in millions)\n​\n$\n 2,800.9\n​\n$\n 2,690.3\n​\n$\n 110.6\nAverage monthly account values (in billions)\n​\n$\n 547.3\n​\n$\n 476.5\n​\n$\n 70.8\n​\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRetirement and Income Solutions Segment Summary Financial Data\nThe following table presents certain summary financial data relating to the Retirement and Income Solutions segment for the years indicated:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n(decrease)\n​\n​\n(in millions)\nOperating revenues:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPremiums and other considerations\n​\n$\n 3,136.9\n​\n$\n 2,935.0\n​\n$\n 201.9\nFees and other revenues\n​\n \n 1,790.4\n​\n \n 1,675.0\n​\n \n 115.4\nNet investment income\n​\n \n 3,048.8\n​\n \n 2,640.2\n​\n \n 408.6\nTotal operating revenues\n​\n \n 7,976.1\n​\n \n 7,250.2\n​\n \n 725.9\nExpenses:\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\nBenefits, claims and settlement expenses, including dividends to policyholders\n​\n \n 5,147.9\n​\n \n 4,624.2\n​\n \n 523.7\nLiability for future policy benefits remeasurement gain\n​\n​\n (4.9)\n​\n​\n (68.0)\n​\n​\n 63.1\nMarket risk benefit remeasurement loss\n​\n​\n 32.2\n​\n​\n 3.7\n​\n​\n 28.5\nOperating expenses\n​\n \n 1,745.2\n​\n \n 1,638.9\n​\n \n 106.3\nTotal expenses\n​\n \n 6,920.4\n​\n \n 6,198.8\n​\n \n 721.6\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPre-tax operating losses attributable to noncontrolling interest\n​\n​\n (0.5)\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n (0.5)\nPre-tax operating earnings\n​\n$\n 1,056.2\n​\n$\n 1,051.4\n​\n$\n 4.8\n​\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nPre-Tax Operating Earnings\nPre-tax operating earnings slightly increased due to an increase in net revenue, which was offset by an increase in operating expenses as described below.\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue increased primarily due to a $115.4 million increase in fee revenue stemming from an increase in average monthly account values, which largely resulted from more favorable financial markets, and a $62.1 million increase in variable investment income. These increases were partially offset by a $70.1 million impact associated with actuarial assumption updates and model refinements, which was unfavorable in 2024 compared to favorable in 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased $91.6 million primarily resulting from growth and investments in the business.\nPrincipal Asset Management Segment\nAUM\nAUM forms the basis for generating our management fee revenues. However, in Chile, the Cuprum business operates differently, as most fees are collected with each deposit made by mandatory retirement customers, based on a capped salary level rather than asset levels. AUM growth is primarily driven by two factors: market performance and net cash flow. Market performance encompasses the returns from equity, fixed income, real estate and other alternative investments, while net cash flow reflects client deposits and withdrawals. Revenue growth increasingly depends on the fee levels associated with these deposits and withdrawals, which can vary significantly depending on the business or product mix. Additionally, our non-U.S. results are influenced by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. The AUM of our foreign subsidiaries is converted to U.S. dollars at the end of the reporting period using spot exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the reporting period.\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the AUM rollforward for assets managed by Principal Asset Management for the periods indicated.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n​\n​\n(in billions)\nAUM, beginning of period\n​\n$\n 668.3\n​\n$\n 610.5\nNet cash flow\n​\n \n (5.9)\n​\n​\n (8.8)\nMarket performance\n​\n​\n 53.4\n​\n​\n 60.1\nOther (1)\n​\n \n (3.5)\n​\n​\n (0.7)\nOperations disposed (2)\n​\n \n (1.0)\n​\n​\n (0.2)\nEffect of exchange rates\n​\n \n (27.9)\n​\n​\n 7.4\nAUM, end of period\n​\n$\n 683.4\n​\n$\n 668.3\n(1)\nIncludes a $(1.3) billion from a capped-fee arrangement in 2024.

This was partially offset by $24.2 million lower performance fee revenue primarily in our real estate business, a $17.0 million increase in variable compensation expense, a $10.9 million increase in variable AUM expenses and a $5.8 million increase in non-variable staff costs. Pre-tax operating earnings increased in our International Pension operations primarily due to $33.2 million of increased earnings from our equity method investments in Brazil primarily as a result of our actuarial assumption review and other updates and $7.4 million of favorable relative market performance on our required regulatory investments. These improvements were partially offset by $25.7 million of foreign currency headwinds.\nBenefits and Protection Segment\nBenefits and Protection Segment Summary Financial Data\nPremium and fees are a key metric for growth in the Benefits and Protection segment. We receive premiums on our specialty benefits insurance products as well as our traditional life insurance products. Fees are generated from our universal life, variable universal life and indexed universal life insurance products. We use several reinsurance programs to help manage the mortality and morbidity risk. Premium and fees are reported net of reinsurance premiums.\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the Benefits and Protection segment premium and fees for the years indicated:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease \n​\n​\n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n(decrease)\n​\n​\n(in millions)\nPremium and fees:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nSpecialty Benefits\n    \n$\n 3,257.2\n​\n$\n 3,055.0\n​\n$\n 202.2\nLife Insurance\n​\n \n 927.5\n​\n​\n 922.2\n​\n​\n 5.3\n​\nThe following table presents certain summary financial data relating to the Benefits and Protection segment for the years indicated:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31,\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease \n​\n​\n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n(decrease)\n​\n​\n(in millions)\nOperating revenues:\n    \n​\n  \n    \n​\n  \n    \n​\n  \nPremiums and other considerations\n​\n$\n 3,714.9\n​\n$\n 3,534.1\n​\n$\n 180.8\nFees and other revenues\n​\n \n 469.0\n​\n​\n 441.3\n​\n​\n 27.7\nNet investment income\n​\n \n 605.1\n​\n​\n 575.9\n​\n​\n 29.2\nTotal operating revenues\n​\n \n 4,789.0\n​\n​\n 4,551.3\n​\n​\n 237.7\nExpenses:\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nBenefits, claims and settlement expenses \n​\n \n 2,638.4\n​\n​\n 2,576.3\n​\n​\n 62.1\nDividends to policyholders\n​\n​\n 99.7\n​\n​\n 89.0\n​\n​\n 10.7\nLiability for future policy benefits remeasurement loss\n​\n \n 154.5\n​\n​\n 16.0\n​\n​\n 138.5\nOperating expenses\n​\n \n 1,433.2\n​\n​\n 1,332.4\n​\n​\n 100.8\nTotal expenses\n​\n \n 4,325.8\n​\n​\n 4,013.7\n​\n​\n 312.1\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPre‑tax operating earnings\n​\n$\n 463.2\n​\n$\n 537.6\n​\n$\n (74.4)\n​\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nPre-Tax Operating Earnings\nPre-tax operating earnings in our Specialty Benefits business increased $28.2 million due to growth in the business, partially offset by $10.9 million due to unfavorable actuarial assumptions and model refinements in 2024 compared to favorable in 2023.

We are monitoring our liquidity closely and feel confident in our ability to meet all long-term obligations to customers, policyholders and debt holders. Our sources of strength include our laddered long-term debt maturities with the next maturity occurring in May 2025, access to revolving credit facility and contingent funding arrangements, a strong risk-based capital position and our available cash and liquid assets. Our legal entity structure has an impact on our ability to meet cash flow needs as an organization. Following is a simplified organizational structure.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity requirements have been and will continue to be met by funds from consolidated operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from credit facilities. We believe the cash flows from these sources are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of our operations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies.\n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe maintain a level of cash and securities which, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, we believe to be adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term payment obligations. We will continue our prudent capital management practice of regularly exploring options available to us to maximize capital flexibility, including accessing the capital markets and careful attention to and management of expenses.\nWe perform rigorous liquidity stress testing to ensure our asset portfolio includes sufficient high quality liquid assets that could be utilized to bolster our liquidity position under increasingly stressed market conditions. These assets could be utilized as collateral for secured borrowing transactions with various third parties or by selling the securities in the open market if needed.\nWe also manage liquidity risk by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other options that can be exercised at inopportune times. For example, as of December 31, 2024, approximately $14.9 billion, or 99%, of our institutional guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements cannot be redeemed by contractholders prior to maturity. Our individual annuity liabilities also contain surrender charges and other provisions limiting early surrenders.\nThe following table summarizes the withdrawal characteristics of our domestic general account investment contracts as of December 31, 2024.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nContractholder funds,\n    \n​\n \n​\n​\nnet of reinsurance\n​\nPercentage\n​\n​\n​\n(in millions)\n​\n​\n \nNot subject to discretionary withdrawal\n​\n$\n 15,852.4\n​\n 54.9\n%\nSubject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments:\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\nSpecified surrender charges\n​\n \n 6,742.0\n​\n 23.3\n​\nMarket value adjustments\n​\n \n 6,314.9\n​\n 21.8\n​\nSubject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments\n​\n \n 0.8\n​\n —\n​\nTotal domestic investment contracts\n​\n$\n 28,910.1\n​\n 100.0\n%\n​\nUniversal life insurance and certain traditional life insurance policies are also subject to discretionary withdrawals by policyholders. However, life insurance policies tend to be less susceptible to withdrawal than our investment contracts because policyholders may be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new life insurance policy. In addition, our life insurance liabilities include surrender charges to discourage early surrenders.\nWe had the following short-term credit financing structures available with various financial institutions as of December 31, 2024:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nFinancing\n    \n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \nAmount\n \nObligor/Applicant\n​\nstructure\n​\nMaturity\n​\nCapacity\n​\noutstanding (4)\n  \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n(in millions)\n​\nPrincipal Life (1)\n \nCredit facility\n \nOctober 2027\n​\n$\n 800.0\n​\n$\n —\n​\nPrincipal Compañía de Seguros de Vida Chile S.A.

The credit facility also provides 100% back-stop support for our commercial paper program, of which we had no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Most of the banks supporting the credit facility have other relationships with us. Due to the financial strength and the strong relationships we have with these providers, we are comfortable we have very low risk the financial institutions would be unable or unwilling to fund this facility.\n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Holding Companies: PFG and PFS.\n The principal sources of funds available to our parent holding company, PFG, are dividends from subsidiaries as well as its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise capital to meet operating and growth needs. These funds are used by PFG to meet its obligations, which include the payment of dividends on common stock, debt service and the repurchase of stock. The declaration and payment of common stock dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board and will depend on our overall financial condition, results of operations, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, receipt of dividends or other distributions from Principal Life (as described below), risk management considerations and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. No significant restrictions limit the payment of dividends by PFG, except those generally applicable to corporations incorporated in Delaware.\nDividends or other distributions from Principal Life, our primary subsidiary, are limited by Iowa law. Under Iowa law, Principal Life may pay dividends or make other distributions only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Iowa (the “Commissioner”) to pay stockholder dividends or make any other distribution if such distribution would exceed certain statutory limitations. Iowa law gives the Commissioner discretion to disapprove requests for distributions in excess of these limitations. Extraordinary dividends include those made, together with dividends and other distributions, within the preceding twelve months that exceed the greater of (i) 10% of statutory policyholder surplus as of the previous year-end excluding admitted disallowed interest maintenance reserve or (ii) the statutory net gain from operations from the previous calendar year, not to exceed earned surplus. Based on statutory results for the year ended December 31, 2024, the ordinary stockholder dividend limitation for Principal Life is approximately $1,313.1 million in 2025. However, because the dividend test is based on dividends previously paid over rolling twelve month periods, if paid before a specified date during 2025, some or all of such dividends may be extraordinary and require regulatory approval.\nTotal stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent in 2024 were $1,010.0 million, all of which was extraordinary and approved by the Commissioner. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1,941.5 million of cash and liquid assets held in our holding companies and other subsidiaries, which is available for corporate purposes. Corporate balances held in foreign holding companies meet the indefinite reinvestment exception.\nIn 2023, total stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent were $1,200.0 million, all of which was extraordinary and approved by the Commissioner.\nOperations.\n Our primary consolidated cash flow sources are premiums from insurance products, pension and annuity deposits, asset management fee revenues, administrative services fee revenues, income from investments and proceeds from the sales or maturity of investments. Cash outflows consist primarily of payment of benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries, income and other taxes, current operating expenses, payment of dividends to policyholders, payments in connection with investments acquired, payments made to acquire subsidiaries, payments relating to policy and contract surrenders, withdrawals, policy loans, interest payments and repayment of short-term debt and long-term debt. Our investment strategies are generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. For a discussion of our investment objectives and strategies, see “Investments.”\nCash Flows.\n Cash flow activity, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, provides relevant information regarding our sources and uses of cash. The following discussion of our operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows excludes cash flows attributable to the separate accounts.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4,602.9 million and $3,792.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our insurance business typically generates positive cash flows from operating activities, as premiums collected from our insurance products and investment income received exceed acquisition costs, benefits paid, redemptions and operating expenses. These positive cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance and investment products and required capital supporting these products. Our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees and investment income received and benefits and expenses paid. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to fluctuations in receivables and payables associated with the timing of settlements, and due to a one-time impact of the YRT Reinsurance Transactions in 2024.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $5,399.0 million and $1,346.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to higher net purchases of available-for-sale securities in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $300.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $2,585.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was due to net investment contract deposits in 2024 as compared to net investment contract withdrawals in 2023 and an increase in banking operation deposits in 2024 as compared to a decrease in 2023. These were partially offset by higher acquisitions of treasury stock in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGuarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities.\n PFG has issued certain notes pursuant to transactions registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Such notes include all currently outstanding senior notes (the “registered notes”). For additional information on the senior notes, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 13, Debt.”\nPFS, a wholly owned subsidiary of PFG, has guaranteed each of the registered notes on a full and unconditional basis. The full and unconditional guarantees require PFS to satisfy the obligations of the guaranteed security immediately, if and when PFG has failed to make a scheduled payment thereunder. If PFS does not make such payment, any holder of the guaranteed security may immediately bring suit directly against PFS for payment of amounts due and payable. No other subsidiary of PFG has guaranteed any of the registered notes.\nSummary financial information is presented below on a combined basis for PFG and PFS (the “obligor group”) and transactions between the obligor group have been eliminated. The summary financial information excludes subsidiaries that are not issuers or guarantors. Any investments by the obligor group in other subsidiaries have been excluded.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n​\n \n(in millions)\nSummary Statements of Financial Position Information:\n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \nTotal investments\n​\n$\n 640.6\n​\n$\n 471.7\nCash and cash equivalents\n​\n \n 357.3\n​\n​\n 603.6\nGoodwill\n​\n \n 618.5\n​\n​\n 618.5\nOther intangibles\n​\n \n 391.2\n​\n​\n 419.3\nOther assets\n​\n \n 313.3\n​\n​\n 344.4\nDue from non-obligor subsidiaries\n​\n \n 42.8\n​\n​\n 59.5\nTotal assets\n​\n \n 2,367.3\n​\n​\n 2,529.0\nLong-term debt\n​\n \n 3,930.6\n​\n​\n 3,927.9\nOther liabilities\n​\n \n 351.2\n​\n​\n 406.3\nDue to non-obligor subsidiaries\n​\n \n 732.2\n​\n​\n 821.6\nTotal liabilities\n​\n \n 5,135.8\n​\n​\n 5,266.6\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nFor the year ended\n    \nFor the year ended\n​\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n​\n \n(in millions)\nSummary Statements of Operations Information:\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n  \nTotal revenues\n​\n$\n 130.6\n​\n$\n 61.8\nTotal expenses\n​\n \n 497.1\n​\n​\n 509.6\nNet loss\n​\n \n (300.6)\n​\n​\n (414.9)\n​\nShelf Registration.\n Under our current shelf registration, we have the ability to issue, in unlimited amounts, unsecured senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debt, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and purchase units of PFG.

See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11, Employee and Agent Benefits” for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nWe report the net funded status of our pension and OPEB plans in the consolidated statements of financial position. The net funded status represents the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension and OPEB plans. The measurement of the net funded status can vary based upon the fluctuations in the fair value of the plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below. The net underfunded status of the pension and OPEB obligation was $391.8 million pre-tax and $449.9 million pre-tax as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Nonqualified pension plan assets are not included as part of the funding status mentioned above. The nonqualified pension plan assets are held in Rabbi trusts for the benefit of all nonqualified plan participants. The assets held in a Rabbi trust are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors only in the event of bankruptcy. Therefore, these assets are fully consolidated in our consolidated statements of financial position and are not reflected in our funded status as they do not qualify as plan assets under U.S. GAAP. The market value of assets held in these trusts was $348.8 million and $342.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur funding policy for the qualified pension plan is to fund the plan annually in an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contributions required under ERISA and, generally, not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We do not anticipate contributions will be needed in 2025 to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of ERISA for our qualified pension plan. We are unable to estimate the amount that may be contributed, but it is possible that we may fund the plans in 2025 up to $70.0 million. This includes funding for both our qualified and nonqualified pension plans. We may contribute to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2025 pending future analysis.\n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations and Contractual Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations identified within Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 9, Contractholder Funds, Note 10, Future Policy Benefits and Claims, Note 12, Reinsurance, Note 13, Debt and Note 16, Contingencies, Guarantees, Indemnifications and Leases.” As of December 31, 2024, we had no unique material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations.\nWe have made commitments to fund certain limited partnerships and other funds. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of unfunded commitments was $1,882.1 million. We are only required to fund additional equity under these commitments when called upon to do so by the partnership or fund; therefore, these commitments are not liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nVariable Interest Entities.\n We have relationships with various types of special purpose entities and other entities where we have a variable interest as described in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3, Variable Interest Entities.” We have made commitments to fund certain limited partnerships, as previously discussed in “Contractual Obligations and Contractual Commitments”, some of which are classified as unconsolidated variable interest entities.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications.\n As of December 31, 2024, no significant changes to guarantees and indemnifications have occurred since December 31, 2023. For guarantee and indemnification information, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16, Contingencies, Guarantees, Indemnifications and Leases” under the caption, “Guarantees and Indemnifications.”\nFinancial Strength and Credit Ratings\nOur ratings are influenced by the relative ratings of our peers/competitors as well as many other factors including our operating and financial performance, capital levels, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), risk exposures, operating leverage and other factors.\nWe have had no significant changes or actions in ratings and rating outlooks that have occurred from January 1, 2024, through the date of this filing.\nThe following table summarizes our significant financial strength and debt ratings from the major independent rating organizations. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such a rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.

The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority (Level 3) to unobservable inputs. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety considering factors specific to the asset or liability. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further details, including a reconciliation of changes in Level 3 fair value measurements.\nAs of December 31, 2024, 47% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 50% were Level 2 and 3% were Level 3. Excluding separate account assets as of December 31, 2024, 4% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 87% were Level 2 and 9% were Level 3.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 46% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 51% were Level 2 and 3% were Level 3. Excluding separate account assets as of December 31, 2023, 3% of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 88% were Level 2 and 9% were Level 3.\nChanges in Level 3 Fair Value Measurements\nNet assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of December 31, 2024, were $8,046.3 million as compared to $7,447.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily related to an increase in the funds withheld payable embedded derivative net asset.\nInvestments\nWe had total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2024, of $313,663.6 million, of which $103,375.8 million were invested assets. A portion of our invested assets represent funds withheld backing reserves as part of coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements. The funds withheld assets and associated net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses) are not included in the discussions below as the investment risk is passed to the reinsurer. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12, Reinsurance” for more information on the funds withheld assets. The rest of our total consolidated assets are comprised primarily of separate account assets for which we do not bear investment risk; therefore, the discussion and financial information below does not include such assets.\nOverall Composition of Invested Assets\nInvested assets as of December 31, 2024, were predominantly high quality and broadly diversified across asset class, individual credit, industry and geographic location. Asset allocation is determined based on cash flow and the risk/return requirements of our products.

These decreases were partially offset increased losses on commercial mortgage loans reserve changes, increased losses on GMWB/RILA activities and reduced gains on equity securities and sponsored investment funds due to equity market movement.\nU.S. Investment Operations\nIn the following sections, we provide details about U.S. Investment Operations, excluding investments held as part of coinsurance with funds withheld agreements. We believe the details of the composition of our investment portfolio excluding the funds withheld are most relevant to an understanding of our operations that are pertinent to investors because all funds withheld assets support obligations and liabilities relating to reinsurance agreements. Guidelines are in place to ensure the investment risk associated with these fund withheld assets are appropriately managed. See Note 12, Reinsurance, for further information on the funds withheld assets.\nOf our invested assets, $80,073.4 million were held by our U.S. operations as of December 31, 2024. Our U.S. invested assets are managed primarily by Principal Asset Management – Investment Management. Our Investment Committee, appointed by our Board, is responsible for establishing investment policies and monitoring risk limits and tolerances. Our primary investment objective is to maximize after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters. We seek to protect customers’ benefits by optimizing the risk/return relationship on an ongoing basis, through asset/liability matching, reducing credit risk, avoiding high levels of investments that may be redeemed by the issuer, maintaining sufficiently liquid investments and avoiding undue asset concentrations through diversification. We are exposed to two primary sources of investment risk:\n●\ncredit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of an obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest and\n●\ninterest rate risk, relating to the market price and/or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves.\nOur ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. We devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment. We manage credit risk through industry, issuer and asset class diversification.\n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\nA dedicated committee, comprised of senior investment professional staff members, approves the credit rating for the fixed maturities we purchase. We have teams of security analysts, organized by industry and asset class, that analyze and monitor these investments. Investments held in the portfolio are monitored on a continuous basis with a formal review annually or more frequently if material events affect the issuer. The analysis includes both fundamental and technical factors. The fundamental analysis encompasses both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the issuer. The qualitative analysis includes an assessment of both accounting and management aggressiveness of the issuer. In addition, technical indicators such as stock price volatility and credit default swap levels are monitored. We regularly review our investments to determine whether we should re-rate them, employing the following criteria:\n●\nmaterial changes in the issuer’s revenues, margins, capital structure or collateral values;\n●\nsignificant management or organizational changes;\n●\nsignificant changes regarding the issuer’s industry;\n●\ndebt service coverage or cash flow ratios that fall below industry-specific thresholds;\n●\nviolation of financial covenants and\n●\nother business factors that relate to the issuer.\nWe purchase credit default swaps to hedge certain credit exposures in our investment portfolio. We economically hedged credit exposure in our portfolio by purchasing credit default swaps with a notional amount of $155.0 million and $85.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We sell credit default swaps and total return swaps to offer credit protection to investors when entering into synthetic replicating transactions. When selling credit protection, if there is an event of default by the referenced name, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security. When selling total return swaps, if there is an event of default by the referenced name, we are obligated to compensate the protection buyer for any decline in the price of the referenced security. For further information on credit derivatives sold, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments” under the caption, “Credit Derivatives Sold.”\nOur use of derivatives exposes us to counterparty risk, or the risk that the counterparty fails to perform the terms of the derivative contract. We actively manage this risk by:\n●\nobtaining approval of all new counterparties by the Investment Committee;\n●\nestablishing exposure limits that take into account non-derivative exposure we have with the counterparty as well as derivative exposure;\n●\nperforming similar credit analysis prior to approval on each derivatives counterparty that we do when lending money on a long-term basis;\n●\ndiversifying our risk across numerous approved counterparties;\n●\nimplementing credit support annex (collateral) agreements (“CSAs”) for over-the-counter derivative transactions or similar agreements with a majority of our counterparties to further limit counterparty exposures, which provide for netting of exposures;\n●\nlimiting exposure to A credit or better for over-the-counter derivative counterparties without CSAs;\n●\nconducting stress-test analysis to determine the maximum exposure created during the life of a prospective transaction;\n●\ndaily monitoring of counterparty credit ratings, exposures and associated collateral levels and\n●\ntrading mandatorily cleared contracts through centralized clearinghouses.\nWe manage our exposure on a net basis, whereby we net positive and negative exposures for each counterparty with agreements in place. For further information on derivative exposure, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Balance Sheet Offsetting.”\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nA dedicated risk management team is responsible for centralized monitoring of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. We apply a variety of guidelines to minimize credit risk in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. When considering new commercial mortgage loans, we review the cash flow fundamentals of the property, make a physical assessment of the underlying commercial real estate, conduct a comprehensive market analysis and compare against industry lending practices. We use a proprietary risk rating model to evaluate all new and substantially all existing loans within the portfolio. The proprietary risk model is designed to stress projected cash flows under simulated economic and market downturns. Our lending guidelines are typically 75% or less loan-to-value ratio and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 times. We analyze investments outside of these guidelines based on cash flow quality, tenancy and other factors. The following table presents loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios for our brick and mortar commercial mortgage loans:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nWeighted average loan\n‑\nto\n‑\nvalue ratio\n​\nDebt service coverage ratio\n \n​\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n  \nNew mortgages\n \n 53\n%  \n 50\n%  \n 1.7\nx\n 1.4\nx\nEntire mortgage portfolio\n \n 50\n%  \n 49\n%  \n 2.3\nx\n 2.5\nx\n​\nWe also seek to manage call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates. We assess and price for call or prepayment risks in all of our investments and monitor these risks in accordance with asset/liability management policies.\nThe amortized cost and weighted average yield, calculated using amortized cost, of non-structured fixed maturity securities that will be callable at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $2,091.5 million and 4.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, and $2,159.0 million and 4.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the amortized cost and weighted average yield of residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities (“RMBS”), residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and asset-backed securities - home equity with material prepayment risk were $8,401.9 million and 4.1%, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, and $6,959.0 million and 3.7%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\nOur investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each primary business operation. In addition, we diversify our product portfolio offerings to include products that contain features that will protect us against fluctuations in interest rates. Those features include adjustable crediting rates, policy surrender charges and market value adjustments on liquidations. For further information on our management of interest rate risk, see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”\nOverall Composition of U.S. Invested Assets\nAs shown in the following table, the major categories of U.S. invested assets are fixed maturities and mortgage loans.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n    \nCarrying amount\n    \n% of total\n    \nCarrying amount\n    \n% of total\n \n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n \nFixed maturities\n​\n$\n 52,960.3\n​\n 66\n%  \n$\n 47,802.3\n​\n 66\n%\nEquity securities\n​\n \n 1,547.6\n \n 2\n​\n \n 667.9\n \n 1\n​\nMortgage loans\n​\n​\n 17,404.6\n​\n 22\n​\n​\n 16,792.1\n​\n 23\n​\nReal estate\n​\n \n 2,463.7\n \n 3\n​\n \n 2,343.4\n \n 3\n​\nPolicy loans\n​\n \n 852.5\n \n 1\n​\n \n 793.2\n \n 1\n​\nOther investments\n​\n \n 4,844.7\n \n 6\n​\n \n 4,121.2\n \n 6\n​\nTotal invested assets\n​\n \n 80,073.4\n \n 100\n%  \n \n 72,520.1\n \n 100\n%\nCash and cash equivalents\n​\n \n 2,882.9\n \n​\n​\n​\n 3,668.8\n \n  \n​\nTotal invested assets and cash\n​\n$\n 82,956.3\n​\n​\n​\n$\n 76,188.9\n \n  \n​\n​\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFixed Maturities\nFixed maturities include bonds, ABS, redeemable preferred stock and certain non-redeemable preferred securities. \nFixed maturities were diversified by category of issuer, as shown in the following table for the years indicated.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n    \nCarrying amount\n    \nPercent of total\n    \nCarrying amount\n    \nPercent of total\n \n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n \nU.S. government and agencies\n​\n$\n 1,102.6\n​\n 2\n%  \n$\n 1,231.9\n​\n 3\n%\nNon-U.S. governments\n​\n \n 393.0\n​\n 1\n​\n \n 378.5\n​\n 1\n​\nStates and political subdivisions\n​\n \n 4,836.3\n​\n 9\n​\n \n 5,143.7\n​\n 11\n​\nCorporate - public\n​\n \n 13,405.7\n​\n 25\n​\n \n 13,690.1\n​\n 29\n​\nCorporate - private\n​\n \n 13,193.4\n​\n 25\n​\n \n 11,258.2\n​\n 24\n​\nResidential mortgage-backed pass-through securities\n​\n \n 3,673.6\n​\n 7\n​\n \n 3,061.8\n​\n 5\n​\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities\n​\n \n 4,446.8\n​\n 8\n​\n \n 3,854.5\n​\n 8\n​\nResidential collateralized mortgage obligations\n​\n \n 4,043.3\n​\n 8\n​\n \n 3,214.8\n​\n 7\n​\nAsset-backed securities\n​\n \n 7,865.6\n​\n 15\n​\n \n 5,968.8\n​\n 12\n​\nTotal fixed maturities\n​\n$\n 52,960.3\n​\n 100\n%  \n$\n 47,802.3\n​\n 100\n%\n​\nWe believe it is desirable to hold residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities due to their credit quality and liquidity as well as portfolio diversification characteristics. Our portfolio is comprised of Government National Mortgage Association, Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation pass-through securities. In addition, our residential collateralized mortgage obligation portfolio offers structural features that allow cash flows to be matched to our liabilities.\nWe purchase commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturities portfolio and to provide attractive returns. The primary risks in holding CMBS are structural and credit risks. Structural risks include the security’s priority in the issuer’s capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments. Credit risks involve collateral and issuer/servicer risk where collateral and servicer performance may deteriorate. CMBS are predominantly comprised of large pool securitizations that are diverse by property type, borrower and geographic dispersion. The risks to any CMBS deal are determined by the credit quality of the underlying loans and how those loans perform over time. Another key risk is the vintage of the underlying loans and the state of the markets during a particular vintage.\nSimilar to CMBS, we purchase ABS for diversification and to provide attractive returns. The primary risks in holding ABS are also structural and credit risks, which are similar to those noted above for CMBS. Our ABS portfolio is diversified by type of asset, issuer, and vintage. We actively monitor holdings of ABS to recognize adverse changes in the risk profile of each security. Prepayments in the ABS portfolio are, in general, insensitive to changes in interest rates or are insulated from such changes by call protection features. In the event we are subject to prepayment risk, we monitor the factors that impact the level of prepayment and prepayment speed for those ABS. In addition, we hold a diverse class of securities, which limits our exposure to any one security.\nThe international exposure held in our U.S. operation’s fixed maturities portfolio was 14% of total fixed maturities as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. It is comprised of corporate and foreign government fixed maturities.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n  \n​\n​\n(in millions)\n \nEuropean Union\n    \n$\n 2,227.9\n​\n$\n 1,826.8\n​\nAustralia/New Zealand\n​\n \n 1,508.6\n​\n​\n 1,389.6\n​\nUnited Kingdom\n​\n \n 1,330.5\n​\n​\n 1,147.7\n​\nLatin America\n​\n \n 1,031.4\n​\n​\n 995.6\n​\nAsia-Pacific\n​\n \n 490.7\n​\n​\n 530.2\n​\nMiddle East and Africa\n​\n \n 490.7\n​\n​\n 451.3\n​\nEurope, non-European Union\n​\n \n 320.5\n​\n​\n 258.1\n​\nOther\n​\n \n 205.4\n​\n​\n 115.1\n​\nTotal\n​\n$\n 7,605.7\n​\n$\n 6,714.4\n​\n​\nInternational fixed maturities exposure is determined by the country of risk of the obligor entity. All international fixed maturities held by our U.S. operations are either denominated in U.S. dollars or have been swapped into U.S. dollar equivalents. Our international investments are analyzed internally by country and industry credit investment professionals. We control concentrations using issuer and country level exposure benchmarks, which are based on the credit quality of the issuer and the country. Our investment policy limits total international fixed maturities investments and we are within those internal limits. Exposure to Canada is not included in our international exposure. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investments in Canada totaled $966.1 million and $958.0 million, respectively.\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFixed Maturities Credit Concentrations.\n One aspect of managing credit risk is through industry, issuer and asset class diversification. Our credit concentrations are managed to established limits. The top 10 exposures comprised 5.4% of single-name credit fixed maturity exposures as of December 31, 2024, and 4.8% as of December 31, 2023.\nFixed Maturities Valuation and Credit Quality.\n Valuation techniques for the fixed maturities portfolio vary by security type and the availability of market data. The use of different pricing techniques and their assumptions could produce different financial results. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements” for further details regarding our pricing methodology. Once prices are determined, they are reviewed by pricing analysts for reasonableness based on asset class and observable market data. Investment analysts who are familiar with specific securities review prices for reasonableness through direct interaction with external sources, review of recent trade activity or use of internal models. All fixed maturities placed on the “watch list” are periodically analyzed by investment analysts. These analysts periodically meet with the Chief Investment Officer and the Portfolio Managers to determine reasonableness of the analysts’ prices. The valuation of bonds for which a credit loss exists and there is no quoted price is typically based on relative value analysis and the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received. Although we believe these values reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities, the key assumptions about risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any) and other market factors involve qualitative and unobservable inputs. \nThe Securities Valuation Office (“SVO”) of the NAIC monitors the bond investments of insurers for regulatory capital and reporting purposes and, when required, assigns securities to one of six categories referred to as NAIC designations. Although NAIC designations are not produced to aid the investment decision making process, NAIC designations may serve as a reasonable proxy for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations’ (“NRSRO”) credit ratings for certain bonds. For most corporate bonds, NAIC designations 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade by such rating organizations. Bonds are considered investment grade when rated ‘‘Baa3’’ or higher by Moody’s, or ‘‘BBB-’’ or higher by S&P. NAIC designations 3 through 6 include bonds generally referred to as below investment grade. Bonds are considered below investment grade when rated ‘‘Ba1’’ or lower by Moody’s, or ‘‘BB+’’ or lower by S&P. \nFor loan-backed and structured securities, as defined by the NAIC, the NAIC designation is not always a reasonable indication of an NRSRO rating as described below. For CMBS and non-agency RMBS, Blackrock Solutions undertakes the modeling of those NAIC designations. This may result in a final designation being higher or lower than the NRSRO credit rating. \nThe following table presents our total fixed maturities by NAIC designation as of the years indicated as well as the percentage, based on fair value, that each designation comprises.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPercent of\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPercent of\n \n​\n​\nAmortized\n​\nCarrying\n​\ncarrying\n​\nAmortized\n​\nCarrying\n​\ncarrying\n \nNAIC designation\n​\ncost\n​\n amount\n​\namount\n​\n \ncost\n​\namount\n​\namount\n \n​\n \n($ in millions)\n​\n1\n    \n$\n 38,458.6\n    \n$\n 35,638.3\n    \n 67\n%  \n$\n 34,601.1\n    \n$\n 32,078.6\n    \n 67\n%\n2\n​\n \n 15,418.8\n​\n \n 14,515.9\n \n 27\n​\n \n 13,624.2\n​\n \n 12,749.5\n \n 27\n​\n3\n​\n \n 2,459.0\n​\n \n 2,389.5\n \n 5\n​\n \n 2,727.3\n​\n \n 2,615.1\n \n 5\n​\n4\n​\n \n 369.1\n​\n \n 338.5\n \n 1\n​\n \n 354.1\n​\n \n 327.4\n \n 1\n​\n5\n​\n \n 84.1\n​\n \n 68.5\n \n —\n​\n \n 9.1\n​\n \n 7.5\n \n —\n​\n6\n​\n \n 12.6\n​\n \n 9.6\n \n —\n​\n \n 31.1\n​\n \n 24.2\n \n —\n​\nUnallocated portfolio layer method basis adjustment (1)\n​\n​\n (55.7)\n​\n​\n —\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n —\n​\nTotal fixed maturities\n​\n$\n 56,746.5\n​\n$\n 52,960.3\n \n 100\n%  \n$\n 51,346.9\n​\n$\n 47,802.3\n \n 100\n%\n(1)\nAmounts represent unallocated basis adjustments related to fair value hedges utilizing the portfolio layer method.\nFixed maturities included 43 securities with an amortized cost of $622.7 million, gross gains of $3.7 million, gross losses of $6.3 million, valuation allowance of $0.0 million and a carrying amount of $620.1 million as of December 31, 2024, that were still pending a review and assignment of a designation by the SVO or NRSRO ratings to be assigned.

We define problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities: (i) with principal and/or interest payments in default or where default is perceived to be imminent in the near term, or (ii) issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities. We define potential problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities included on an internal “watch list” for which management has concerns as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt payment terms and which may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured. The decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by our management as to the likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer. We define restructured securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities where a concession has been granted to the borrower related to the borrower’s financial difficulties that would not have otherwise been considered. We determine that restructures should occur in those instances where greater economic value will be realized under the new terms than through liquidation or other disposition and may involve a change in contractual cash flows. If the present value of the restructured cash flows is less than the current cost of the asset being restructured, a realized capital loss is recorded in net income and a new cost basis is established.\nThe following table presents the total carrying amount of our fixed maturities portfolio, as well as its problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities for the years indicated.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n \nTotal fixed maturities\n    \n$\n 52,960.3\n    \n$\n 47,802.3\n​\nProblem fixed maturities (1)\n​\n$\n 76.5\n​\n$\n 42.6\n​\nPotential problem fixed maturities\n​\n \n 88.3\n​\n \n 66.7\n​\nTotal problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities\n​\n$\n 164.8\n​\n$\n 109.3\n​\nTotal problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities as a percent of total fixed maturities\n​\n \n 0.31\n%  \n \n 0.23\n%\n(1)\nThe problem fixed maturities carrying amount is net of the credit loss valuation allowance.\nFixed Maturities Credit Losses.\n Each reporting period, a group of individuals including the Chief Investment Officer, our Portfolio Managers, the assigned analysts and representatives from Investment Accounting review all securities to determine whether a credit loss exists. The analysis focuses on each issuer’s ability to service its debts in a timely fashion. Formal documentation of the analysis and our decision is prepared and approved by management. For additional details regarding our process to identify and evaluate securities with credit losses, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Allowance for Credit Loss.”\nWe would not consider a security with unrealized losses to have a decline in value due to credit when it is not our intent to sell the security, it is not more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost, which may be maturity, and we expect to recover the amortized cost basis. However, we do sell securities under certain circumstances, such as when we have evidence of a change in the issuer’s creditworthiness, when we anticipate poor relative future performance of securities, when a change in regulatory requirements modifies what constitutes a permissible investment or the maximum level of investments held or when there is an increase in capital requirements or a change in risk weights of debt securities. Sales generate both gains and losses.\n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nA number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit losses and determining the allowance for credit loss. These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer’s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer, (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated, (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. Any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period.\nThe net realized loss relating to the change in the allowance for credit loss and credit related sales of fixed maturities was $28.3 million and $48.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFixed Maturities Available-For-Sale\nThe following tables present our fixed maturities

31, 2024, $5.3 million in losses were attributed to securities scheduled to mature in one year or less, $222.4 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between one to five years, $572.5 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between five to ten years, $2,384.7 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature after ten years and $1,061.3 million related to mortgage-backed and other ABS that are not classified by maturity year. As of December 31, 2024, we were in a $3,769.9 million net unrealized loss position as compared to a $3,542.9 million net unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023. The $227.0 million increase in net unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2024, can be attributed to an increase in interest rates partially offset by tightening of credit spreads.\nFixed Maturities Available-For-Sale Unrealized Losses.\n We believe our long-term fixed maturities portfolio is well diversified among industry types and between publicly traded and privately placed securities. Each year, we direct the majority of our net cash inflows into investment grade fixed maturities. Our current policy is to limit the percentage of fixed maturities invested in below investment grade assets to 15%.\nWe invest in privately placed fixed maturities to enhance the overall value of the portfolio, increase diversification and obtain higher yields than are possible with comparable quality public market securities. Generally, private placements provide broader access to management information, strengthened negotiated protective covenants, call protection features and, where applicable, a higher level of collateral. They are, however, generally not freely tradable because of restrictions imposed by U.S. federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets.\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our fixed maturities available-for-sale by investment grade and below investment grade as of the years indicated.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \nGross\n    \nGross\n    \nAllowance\n    \n​\n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \nGross\n    \nGross\n    \nAllowance\n    \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\nAmortized\n​\nunrealized\n​\nunrealized\n​\nfor credit\n​\nCarrying\n​\nAmortized\n​\nunrealized\n​\nunrealized\n​\nfor credit\n​\nCarrying\n \n​\n​\ncost\n​\ngains\n​\nlosses\n​\nloss\n​\namount\n​\ncost\n​\ngains\n​\nlosses\n​\nloss\n​\namount\n  \n​\n​\n(in millions)\n \nInvestment grade:\n \n​\n  \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPublic\n​\n$\n 40,829.3\n​\n$\n 223.4\n​\n$\n 3,319.7\n​\n$\n 0.1\n​\n$\n 37,732.9\n​\n$\n 37,197.9\n​\n$\n 324.9\n​\n$\n 3,077.1\n​\n$\n —\n​\n$\n 34,445.7\n​\nPrivate\n​\n \n 12,665.7\n​\n \n 177.5\n​\n \n 804.3\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 12,038.9\n​\n \n 10,738.5\n​\n \n 137.7\n​\n \n 782.7\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 10,093.5\n​\nBelow investment grade:\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\nPublic\n​\n \n 1,047.1\n​\n \n 6.5\n​\n \n 102.4\n​\n \n 0.1\n​\n \n 951.1\n​\n \n 1,352.1\n​\n \n 6.2\n​\n \n 139.1\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 1,219.2\n​\nPrivate\n​\n \n 1,612.3\n​\n \n 13.2\n​\n \n 19.8\n​\n \n 16.1\n​\n \n 1,589.6\n​\n \n 1,623.0\n​\n \n 10.3\n​\n \n 23.1\n​\n \n 1.7\n​\n \n 1,608.5\n​\nTotal fixed maturities, available-for-sale (1)\n​\n$\n 56,154.4\n​\n$\n 420.6\n​\n$\n 4,246.2\n​\n$\n 16.3\n​\n$\n 52,312.5\n​\n$\n 50,911.5\n​\n$\n 479.1\n​\n$\n 4,022.0\n​\n$\n 1.7\n​\n$\n 47,366.9\n​\n(1)\nExcludes unallocated basis adjustments related to fair value hedges utilizing the portfolio layer method.\nIncluded in the public category carrying amount as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were $15,165.7 million and $12,017.4 million, respectively, of securities subject to certain holding periods and resale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933.\nThe following tables present the fair value and the gross unrealized losses on our fixed maturities available-for-sale for which an allowance for credit loss has not been recorded by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n​\n​\nLess than\n​\nGreater than or\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\ntwelve months\n​\nequal to twelve months\n​\nTotal\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGross\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGross\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGross\n​\n​\nFair\n​\nunrealized\n​\nFair\n​\nunrealized\n​\nFair\n​\nunrealized\n​\n    \nvalue\n    \nlosses\n    \nvalue\n    \nlosses\n    \nvalue\n    \nlosses\n​\n \n(in millions)\nFixed maturities, available-for-sale (1):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nU.S. government and agencies\n​\n$\n 641.2\n​\n$\n 13.7\n​\n$\n 543.2\n​\n$\n 82.2\n​\n$\n 1,184.4\n​\n$\n 95.9\nNon-U.S. governments\n​\n \n 32.9\n​\n \n 1.3\n​\n \n 207.0\n​\n \n 54.5\n​\n \n 239.9\n​\n \n 55.8\nStates and political subdivisions\n​\n \n 704.7\n​\n \n 23.8\n​\n \n 3,552.3\n​\n \n 785.6\n​\n \n 4,257.0\n​\n \n 809.4\nCorporate\n​\n \n 3,289.0\n​\n \n 65.7\n​\n \n 14,243.8\n​\n \n 2,157.9\n​\n \n 17,532.8\n​\n \n 2,223.6\nResidential mortgage-backed pass-through securities\n​\n \n 1,938.4\n​\n \n 33.1\n​\n \n 1,211.6\n​\n \n 181.1\n​\n \n 3,150.0\n​\n \n 214.2\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities\n​\n \n676.9\n​\n \n 8.1\n​\n \n 3,157.3\n​\n \n 362.4\n​\n \n 3,834.2\n​\n \n 370.5\nCollateralized debt obligations (2)\n​\n \n 259.5\n​\n \n 0.3\n​\n \n 29.8\n​\n \n 5.0\n​\n \n 289.3\n​\n \n 5.3\nOther debt obligations\n​\n \n 1,363.1\n​\n \n 17.1\n​\n \n 2,799.2\n​\n \n 453.0\n​\n \n 4,162.3\n​\n \n 470.1\nTotal fixed maturities, available-for-sale\n​\n$\n 8,905.7\n​\n$\n 163.1\n​\n$\n 25,744.2\n​\n$\n 4,081.7\n​\n$\n 34,649.9\n​\n$\n 4,244.8\n(1)\nFair value and gross unrealized losses are excluded for available-for-sale securities for which an allowance for credit loss has been recorded.

For further details about residential mortgage loans, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Financing Receivables.”\nCommercial Mortgage Loans.\n We generally report commercial mortgage loans on real estate at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances.\nCommercial mortgage loans play an important role in our investment strategy by:\n●\nproviding strong risk-adjusted relative value in comparison to other investment alternatives;\n●\nenhancing total returns and\n●\nproviding strategic portfolio diversification.\nAs a result, we have focused on constructing a high quality portfolio of mortgages. Our portfolio is generally comprised of mortgages originated with conservative loan-to-value ratios, high debt service coverages and general purpose property types with a strong credit tenancy.\nOur commercial mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of non-recourse, fixed rate mortgages on fully or near fully leased properties. The mortgage portfolio is comprised primarily of office properties, apartments, well-anchored retail properties and general-purpose industrial properties.\nOur commercial mortgage loan portfolio is diversified by geography and specific collateral property type. Commercial mortgage lending in the state of California accounted for 24% and 25% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio before valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We are, therefore, exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of catastrophes, including but not limited to earthquakes, fires, drought, extreme heat, flooding, and tsunamis, that may affect the region. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not experience any material losses due to the aforementioned catastrophe risks.\nThe typical borrower in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is a single purpose entity or single asset entity. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding were 620 and 596, of which 35% and 38% were for loans with principal balances less than $10.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average loan size of our commercial mortgage portfolio was $23.2 million and $22.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nCommercial Mortgage Loan Credit Monitoring.\n For further details on monitoring and management of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Financing Receivables Credit Monitoring.”\n69\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe categorize loans that are 60 days or more delinquent, loans in process of foreclosure and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are delinquent as “problem” loans. We categorize loans that are delinquent less than 60 days where the default is expected to be cured and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are current as “potential problem” loans. The decision whether to classify a loan delinquent less than 60 days as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by management as to the likely future economic conditions and developments with respect to the borrower. We categorize loans for which the original note rate has been reduced below market and loans for which the principal has been reduced as “restructured” loans. We also consider loans that are refinanced more than one year beyond the original maturity or call date at below market rates as restructured.\nWe had three delinquent problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of $20.6 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $18.9 million as of December 31, 2024. We also had two potential problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of $140.5 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $33.0 million and one restructured problem commercial mortgage loan with a carrying amount of $34.1 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $34.1 million as of December 31, 2024. We had one delinquent problem commercial mortgage loan with a carrying amount of $7.9 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $7.9 million as of December 31, 2023. We also had two potential problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of $95.4 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $11.9 million and two restructured problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of $92.7 million for which we had a valuation allowance of $34.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n \nTotal commercial mortgage loans\n​\n$\n 14,196.0\n​\n$\n 13,544.9\n​\nProblem commercial mortgage loans\n​\n$\n 1.7\n​\n$\n —\n​\nPotential problem commercial mortgage loans\n​\n​\n 107.5\n​\n​\n 83.5\n​\nRestructured problem commercial mortgage loans\n​\n​\n —\n​\n \n 58.6\n​\nTotal problem, potential problem and restructured commercial mortgage loans\n​\n$\n 109.2\n​\n$\n 142.1\n​\nTotal problem, potential problem and restructured commercial mortgage loans as a percent of total commercial mortgage loans\n​\n \n 0.77\n%  \n \n 1.05\n%\n​\nCommercial Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowance.\n We establish the commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance at levels considered adequate to absorb estimated expected credit losses within the portfolio. For further details on the commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption, “Financing Receivables Valuation Allowance.”  \nReal Estate\nReal estate consists primarily of commercial equity real estate. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of our equity real estate investment was $2,463.7 million and $2,343.4 million, respectively. Our commercial equity real estate is held in the form of wholly owned real estate, real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans and majority owned interests in real estate joint ventures.\nEquity real estate is categorized as either “real estate held for investment” or “real estate held for sale.” The carrying value of real estate held for investment is generally adjusted for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Such impairment adjustments are recorded as net realized capital losses in our consolidated results of operations. No such impairment adjustments were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024 or for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOnce we identify a real estate property to be sold and it is probable that it will be sold, we classify the property as held for sale. We establish a valuation allowance subject to periodic revisions, if necessary, to adjust the carrying value of the property to reflect the lower of its current carrying value or the fair value, less associated selling costs. The valuation allowance did not change for the year ended December 31, 2024 or for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe use research, both internal and external, to recommend appropriate product and geographic allocations and changes to the equity real estate portfolio. We monitor product, geographic and industry diversification separately and together to determine the most appropriate mix.\nEquity real estate is distributed across geographic regions of the country. As of December 31, 2024, our largest equity real estate portfolio concentration was in the Pacific (47%) region of the United States. By property type, our largest concentrations were in Industrial (33%) and Office (32%) as of December 31, 2024.\n70\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOther Investments\nOur other investments totaled $4,844.7 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $4,121.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Other investments include interests in unconsolidated entities, which include real estate properties owned jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners; sponsored investment funds; the cash surrender value of company owned and trust owned life insurance; derivative assets and other investments.\nInternational Investment Operations\nOf our invested assets, $6,127.9 million were held by our international operations as of December 31, 2024. Due to the regulatory constraints in each location, each company maintains its own investment policies.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket Risk Exposures and Risk Management\nMarket risk is the risk we will incur losses due to adverse fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to interest rates, equity markets and foreign currency exchange rates. The active management of market risk is an integral part of our operations. We manage our overall market risk exposure within established risk tolerance ranges using several approaches, including:\n●\nrebalancing our existing asset or liability portfolios;\n●\ncontrolling the risk structure of newly acquired assets and liabilities and\n●\nusing derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets or liabilities or assets expected to be purchased.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk arises primarily from our holdings in interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Changes in interest rates impact numerous aspects of our operations, including but not limited to:\n●\nyield on our invested assets;\n●\nrate of interest we credit to contractholder account balances;\n●\ntiming of cash flows on assets and liabilities containing embedded prepayment options;\n●\ncost of hedging our GMWB rider;\n●\ndiscount rate used in valuing our liability for future policy benefits for long-duration insurance and annuity contracts;\n71\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\ndiscount rate used in valuing our pension and OPEB obligations;\n●\nstatutory reserve and capital requirements;\n●\nasset-based fees earned on the fixed income assets we manage;\n●\ninterest expense on our long-term borrowings;\n●\nfair value of intangible assets in our reporting units and\n●\nfair value of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position.\nLower interest rates generally result in lower profitability in the long-term. Conversely, higher interest rates generally result in higher profitability in the long-term. However, an increase in market interest rates may cause a decline in the value of financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position.\nImpact of Changes in Long-Term Interest Rate Assumptions\nWe use long-term interest rate assumptions to calculate MRBs, certain reserves and benefit plan obligations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In setting these assumptions, we consider a variety of factors, including historical experience, emerging trends and future expectations. We evaluate our assumptions on at least an annual basis. Due to the long-term nature of our assumptions, we generally do not revise our assumptions in response to short-term fluctuations in market interest rates. However, we will consider revising our assumptions if a significant change occurs in the factors noted above.\nA reduction in our long-term interest rate assumptions may result in increases in MRB liabilities and certain reserves.\nImpact of Changes in Interest Rates\nChanges in interest rates or a sustained low interest rate environment may result in the following impacts, which would impact our financial position and results of operations:\n​\n​\nImpact of Falling Interest Rates or Sustained Low Interest Rates\n​\n​\nImpact of Rising Interest Rates\n​\n​\nAdverse Impacts:\n​\n​\nPositive Impacts:\n​\n​\nA reduction in investment income, which may be partially offset by a reduction in the interest we credit on contractholder account balances; however, our ability to lower crediting rates may be constrained by guaranteed minimum interest rates and competitive pressures\n​\n​\nAn increase in investment income, which may be partially or fully offset by an increase in the interest we credit on contractholder account balances\n​\n​\nAn increase in the cost of hedging our GMWB rider\n​\n​\nA decrease in the cost of hedging our GMWB rider\n​\n​\nAn increase in MRB liabilities and certain reserves\n​\n​\nA decrease in MRB liabilities and certain reserves\n​\n​\nA reduction in the discount rate used to measure reserves for long-duration insurance and annuity contracts, leading to an increase in our reserves\n​\n​\nAn increase in the discount rate used to measure reserves for long-duration insurance and annuity contracts, leading to a decrease in our reserves\n​\n​\nA reduction in the discount rate used in valuing our pension and OPEB obligations, leading to an increase in our Projected Benefit Obligation, Net Periodic Pension Cost, Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation and Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n​\n​\nAn increase in the discount rate used in valuing our pension and OPEB obligations, leading to a decrease in our Projected Benefit Obligation, Net Periodic Pension Cost, Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation and Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n​\n​\nAn increase in statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves\n​\n​\nA decrease in statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves\n​\n​\nAn increase in prepayments or redemptions on mortgages and bonds we own, which would force us to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates\n​\n​\nA decrease in prepayments or redemptions on mortgages and bonds we own, which would reduce our opportunity to reinvest the proceeds at higher interest rates\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPositive Impacts:\n​\n​\nAdverse Impacts:\n​\n​\nAn increase in the value of the fixed income assets we manage, resulting in an increase in our fee revenue in the short-term\n​\n​\nA decrease in the value of the fixed income assets we manage, resulting in a decrease in our fee revenue in the short-term\n​\n​\nA decrease in the interest expense on our long-term borrowings, to the extent the borrowings have adjustable rates or we are able to refinance our obligations at lower interest rates\n​\n​\nAn increase in the interest expense on our long-term borrowings, to the extent the borrowings have adjustable rates or we refinance our obligations at higher interest rates\n​\n​\nAn increase in the fair value of certain financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position\n​\n​\nA decrease in the fair value of certain financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position, as discussed below\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nA reduction in the fair value of intangible assets in our reporting units, potentially leading to an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets\n​\n​\n72\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe estimate a hypothetical 100 basis point immediate, parallel decrease in U.S. interest rates would impact segment pre-tax operating earnings between (1)% and 1% over the next twelve months. This estimate reflects the impact of routine management actions in response to changes in interest rates, such as reducing the interest rates we credit on contractholder account balances, but does not reflect the impact of other actions management may consider, such as curtailing sales of certain products.\nThe selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel decrease in U.S. interest rates should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the impact of such an event. Our exposure will change as a result of ongoing portfolio transactions in response to new business, management’s assessment of changing market conditions and changes in our mix of business.\nIf market rates increase rapidly, policy surrenders, withdrawals and requests for policy loans may increase as customers seek to achieve higher returns. Excess lapses may result in an acceleration of amortization for our DAC and other actuarial balances. We may be required to sell assets to raise the cash necessary to respond to such surrenders, withdrawals and loans, thereby realizing capital losses on the assets sold.\nGuaranteed Minimum Interest Rate Exposure\n. The following table provides detail on the differences between the interest rates being credited to contractholders as of December 31, 2024, and the respective guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Amounts for contracts without significant fee revenues such as GICs, funding agreements, retail fixed income annuities and guaranteed pension contracts are excluded. Additionally, amounts for contracts that are reinsured are also excluded. Account values are broken down by GMIR level within the Retirement and Income Solutions and Benefits and Protection segments.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAccount values (1)\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nExcess of crediting rates over GMIR:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nUp to 0.50%\n​\n0.51% to 1.00%\n​\n1.01% to 2.00%\n​\n2.01% or more\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nAt GMIR\n    \nabove GMIR\n    \nabove GMIR\n    \nabove GMIR\n    \nabove GMIR\n    \nTotal\n​\n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n​\nGuaranteed minimum interest rate\n​\n​\n  \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nRetirement and Income Solutions\n​\n​\n  \n​\n \n  \n​\n \n  \n​\n \n  \n​\n \n  \n \n​\n  \n​\nUp to 1.00%\n​\n$\n 19.2\n​\n$\n —\n​\n$\n —\n​\n$\n 1,041.7\n​\n$\n 445.2\n​\n$\n 1,506.1\n​\n1.01% ‑ 2.00%\n \n​\n 3,730.8\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 1,056.3\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 4,787.1\n​\n2.01% ‑ 3.00%\n \n​\n 236.1\n​\n \n 186.9\n​\n \n 1.8\n​\n \n 2,900.0\n​\n \n 2,740.1\n​\n \n 6,064.9\n​\n3.01% ‑ 4.00%\n \n​\n 7.6\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 7.6\n​\n4.01% and above\n​\n​\n 13.9\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n 13.9\n​\nSubtotal\n \n​\n 4,007.6\n​\n \n 186.9\n​\n \n 1.8\n​\n \n 4,998.0\n​\n \n 3,185.3\n​\n \n 12,379.6\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nBenefits and Protection\n \n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\nUp to 1.00%\n \n​\n —\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 1.5\n​\n \n 14.9\n​\n \n 4.9\n​\n \n 21.3\n​\n1.01% ‑ 2.00%\n \n​\n —\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 4.3\n​\n \n 452.3\n​\n \n 456.6\n​\n2.01% ‑ 3.00%\n \n​\n 3.4\n​\n \n 8.8\n​\n \n 109.9\n​\n \n 368.7\n​\n \n 6.3\n​\n \n 497.1\n​\n3.01% ‑ 4.00%\n \n​\n 1,516.9\n​\n \n 54.5\n​\n \n 34.3\n​\n \n 101.6\n​\n \n 2.5\n​\n \n 1,709.8\n​\n4.01% and above\n \n​\n 23.5\n​\n \n 2.5\n​\n \n 7.0\n​\n \n 18.9\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 51.9\n​\nSubtotal\n \n​\n 1,543.8\n​\n \n 65.8\n​\n \n 152.7\n​\n \n 508.4\n​\n \n 466.0\n​\n \n 2,736.7\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal\n​\n$\n 5,551.4\n​\n$\n 252.7\n​\n$\n 154.5\n​\n$\n 5,506.4\n​\n$\n 3,651.3\n​\n$\n 15,116.3\n​\nPercentage of total\n \n​\n 36.7\n%  \n​\n 1.7\n%  \n​\n 1.0\n%  \n​\n 36.4\n%  \n​\n 24.2\n%  \n \n 100.0\n%\n(1)\nIncludes only the account values, net of the account values with associated policy loans, for products with GMIRs and discretionary crediting rates, excluding amounts for contracts that are reinsured.\nImpact of Rising Interest Rates on the Fair Value of Financial Assets.\n An increase in market interest rates may cause a decline in the value of financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position. Although changes in the fair value of our financial assets due to changes in interest rates may impact the amount of equity reported in our consolidated statements of financial position, these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments, terminate derivative positions, record an allowance for credit loss, or determine a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge.\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe estimate a hypothetical 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates would reduce the net reported fair value of our financial assets and derivatives by $2,670.8 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $2,670.3 million as of December 31, 2023. This estimate only reflects the change in fair value for financial assets and derivatives reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position. Assets and liabilities not reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position – including mortgage loans, liabilities relating to insurance contracts, investment contracts, debt and bank deposits – are excluded from this sensitivity analysis. We believe the excluded liability items would economically serve as a partial offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis. Separate account assets and liabilities are also excluded from this estimate, as any interest rate risk is borne by the holder of the separate account. Assets backing reserves as part of a coinsurance with funds withheld agreement are excluded from this estimate, as any interest rate risk is passed to the reinsurer. For more information on fair value measurements, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements.”\nOur selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario we use to demonstrate potential risk. While a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase does not represent our view of future market changes, it is a near term reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events. While this sensitivity analysis provides a representation of interest rate sensitivity, it is based on our portfolio exposures at a point in time and may not be representative of future market results. These exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio transactions in response to new business, management’s assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe manage interest rate risk through the use of an integrated risk management framework. This helps us identify, assess, monitor, report and manage our risks within established limits and risk tolerances. Our internal risk committees monitor and discuss our risk profile and identify necessary actions to mitigate impacts from interest rate risk.\nThe product designs within our business units result in a variety of different interest rate risk profiles. Therefore, our business units use a variety of different approaches for managing their asset and liability interest rate risks.\n●\nRetirement Business Stable Cash Flows\n – For stable and predictable cash flow liabilities, such as pension risk transfer, WSRS, and investment only, we use investment strategy and hedges to tightly align the cash flow run off of these asset and liability cash flows. Immunization analysis is also utilized in the management of interest rate risk.\n●\nU.S. Insurance Stable Cash Flows\n – Our insurance businesses in many instances contain long-term guarantees with stable and predictable liability cash flows and recurring premiums. We manage the interest rate risk through investment strategy, product crediting rates and analyzing duration and embedded value sensitivity.\n●\nPrincipal Asset Management\n – Our international businesses operate within local regulations and financial market conditions (e.g., derivative markets, assets available) to achieve similar asset and liability cash flow management objectives. In locations with a limited availability of long-dated assets and derivative markets, the duration gap is managed to risk tolerances specific to each location.\nWe also limit our exposure to interest rate risk through our business mix and strategy. We have intentionally limited our exposure to specific products where investment margins are critical to the product’s profitability, and we continue to emphasize the sale of products that generate revenues in the form of fees for service or premiums for insurance coverage and expose us to minimal interest rate risk.\nPrepayment risk is controlled by limiting our exposure to investments that are prepayable without penalty prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. We also require additional yield on these investments to compensate for the risk the issuer will exercise such option. Prepayment risk is also controlled by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other options that can be exercised at inopportune times. We manage the interest rate risk associated with our long-term borrowings by monitoring the interest rate environment and evaluating refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach.\nThe plan fiduciaries use a Dynamic Asset Allocation strategy for our qualified defined benefit pension plan, which strategically allocates an increasing portion of the assets of the pension plan to fixed income securities as the funding status improves. The intended purpose of using the Dynamic Asset Allocation strategy is that the expected change in the value of the plan assets and the change in pension benefit obligation due to market movements are more likely to have more correlation versus a static allocation of assets between categories. For more information see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Benefit Plans” and Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15, Employee and Agent Benefits.”\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk.\n We use or have used various derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, interest rate options, to be announced (“TBA”) forwards, bond forwards, treasury forwards, swaptions and futures. We use interest rate swaps, treasury forwards and futures contracts to hedge against changes in the value of the GMWB MRB. We use interest rate swaps, treasury forwards and have used TBA forwards primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities. They can be used to change the sensitivity to the interest rate of specific assets and liabilities as well as an entire portfolio. We use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability on recognized assets due to fluctuations in market interest rates. We use bond forwards to fix the purchase price of a bond at a specified date in the future. We use interest rate options to manage prepayment risks in our assets and minimum guaranteed interest rates and lapse risks in our liabilities. We have purchased swaptions to hedge interest rate exposure for certain assets and liabilities.\nForeign Currency Risk\nForeign currency risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk arises from foreign currency-denominated funding agreements issued to nonqualified institutional investors in the international market, foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, and our international operations, including expected cash flows and potential acquisition and divestiture activity.\nWe estimate as of December 31, 2024, a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed would result in no material change to the net fair value of our foreign currency-denominated instruments identified above because we effectively hedge foreign currency-denominated instruments to minimize exchange rate impacts, which is consistent with our estimate as of December 31, 2023. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates do affect the translation of segment pre-tax operating earnings and equity of our international operations into our consolidated financial statements.\nFor our international operations, we estimate a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we were exposed would have resulted in a $277.0 million, or 7%, reduction in the total equity excluding noncontrolling interests of our international operations as of December 31, 2024, as compared to an estimated $324.1 million, or 8%, reduction as of December 31, 2023. We estimate a 10% unfavorable change in the average foreign currency exchange rates to which we were exposed through our international operations would have resulted in a $43.7 million, or 5%, reduction in segment pre-tax operating earnings of our international operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to an estimated $40.9 million, or 5%, reduction for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe selection of a 10% immediate unfavorable change in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event. These exposures will change as a result of a change in the size and mix of our foreign operations. \nUse of Derivatives to Manage Foreign Currency Risk.\n The foreign currency risk on funding agreements and fixed maturities in our U.S. operations is mitigated by using currency swaps that swap the foreign currency interest and principal payments to our functional currency. We did not have currency swap agreements associated with foreign-denominated liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The notional amount of our currency swap agreements associated with foreign-denominated fixed maturities was $2,669.3 million and $1,888.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nWith regard to our international operations, in order to enhance the diversification of our investment portfolios we may invest in bonds denominated in a currency that is different than the currency of our liabilities. We use foreign exchange derivatives to economically hedge the currency mismatch. Our international operations had currency swaps with a notional amount of $214.5 million and $217.3 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our international operations also utilized currency forwards with a notional amount of $694.8 million and $711.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nWe use currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with expected cash flows in our foreign operations. We held currency forwards with a notional of $179.7 million and $265.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. \nAdditionally, we use currency forwards to hedge net equity investments in our foreign operations, including certain sponsored investment funds. We held currency forwards with a notional amount of $50.8 million and $31.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. \nWe also use currency forwards to hedge certain foreign-denominated investments in our domestic operations. We held currency forwards with a notional amount of $55.9 million and $54.1 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\nEquity Risk\nEquity risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in equity markets. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our equity securities was $2,295.0 million and $1,478.1 million, respectively. We estimate a 10% decline in the prices of the equity securities would result in a decline in fair value of our equity securities of $229.5 million as of December 31, 2024, as compared to a decline in fair value of our equity securities of $147.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\nWe are also exposed to the risk that asset-based fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in investment prices and the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower. \nWe also have equity risk associated with (1) universal life contracts that credit interest to customers based on changes in an external equity index; (2) variable annuity contracts that have a GMWB rider that allows the customer to make withdrawals of a specified annual amount, either for a fixed number of years or for the lifetime of the customer, even if the account value is reduced to zero; (3) variable annuity contracts that have a GMDB that allows the death benefit to be paid, even if the account value has fallen below the GMDB amount; (4) SEC-registered annuity contracts with returns linked to an external equity index and (5) investment contracts in which the return is subject to minimum contractual guarantees. We are also subject to equity risk based upon the assets that support our employee benefit plans. For further discussion of equity risk associated with these plans, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Benefit Plans.”\nWe estimate an immediate 10% downward equity shock, followed by a 2% per quarter increase would reduce our annual segment pre-tax operating earnings by approximately 5% to 8% over the next twelve months. The selection of a 10% unfavorable equity shock should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event. Our exposure will change as a result of changes in our mix of business.\nSeparate and distinct from our equity risk associated with a decline in the S&P index, we also have equity risk associated with certain domestic alternative investments. These investments are comprised of several asset categories (including hedge funds, private equity, infrastructure and direct lending) that provide an attractive asset match to our long-dated liabilities and create diversification benefits to our fixed income investments. The risk profile of these investments is actively monitored by our Investment Committee and our corporate risk management function. Changes in the value of these investments will impact earnings. We estimate an immediate 10% decline in the value of those assets, followed by a 2% per quarter increase would reduce our annual segment pre-tax operating earnings by less than 8%. The selection of a 10% unfavorable change in the value of those assets should not be construed as a prediction of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such a decline in value of those assets.\nUse of Derivatives to Manage Equity Risk.\n We economically hedge the universal life products, where the interest credited is linked to an external equity index, by purchasing options that match the product’s profile or selling options to offset existing exposures. We economically hedge certain investments using total return swaps to swap the equity risk for income enhancement. We economically hedge RILA index credit exposure using options and futures. We economically hedge the GMWB rider MRB exposure, which includes interest rate risk and equity risk, using futures, options, treasury forwards and interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $7,678.0 million and $8,600.5 million as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of both MRBs and associated hedging instruments are sensitive to financial market conditions and the variance related to the change in fair value of these items for a given period is largely dependent on market conditions at the end of the period.\n​\n76\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem \n8.

In our opinion, Principal Financial Group, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n​\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n​\n​\n​\nDes Moines, Iowa\n​\nFebruary 19, 2025\n​\n​\n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Principal Financial Group, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Principal Financial Group, Inc.(the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n​\n79\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\n​\nValuation of investments in securities\nDescription of the Matter\n​\nA subset of the Company’s $69.3 billion fixed-income securities portfolio exhibits higher estimation uncertainty when determining fair value. The fixed-income securities, which include bonds, asset-backed securities, redeemable preferred stock and certain non-redeemable preferred securities, are classified as either available-for-sale or trading and, accordingly, are carried at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. As discussed in Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements, for certain securities the Company obtains prices from third party pricing vendors, a subset of which exhibit higher estimation uncertainty given the characteristics of the security. In addition, the Company uses a matrix priced internal model to develop the fair value for a subset of corporate bonds. The fair value is developed using a risk spread which creates higher estimation uncertainty. \nAuditing the fair value of the securities that exhibit higher estimation uncertainty was especially challenging because determining the fair value is complex and highly judgmental and involves using inputs and assumptions that are not directly observable in the market.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n​\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management’s valuation process for the fixed income securities portfolio that exhibits higher estimation uncertainty. This included, among others, testing the review and approval process that management has in place over validating the fair value from third party pricing sources and the assumptions used in determining the fair value for matrix priced securities. \nTo test the fair value calculation, we utilized the support of our valuation specialists which included, among others, independently calculating a reasonable range of fair values for a sample of securities by using a cash flow model and cash flow and yield assumptions based on independently obtained information or available transaction data for similar securities. We compared these ranges to management’s estimates of fair value for the selected securities.\n​\n​\nLiability for future policy benefits and claims\nDescription of the Matter\n​\nAt December 31, 2024, future policy benefits and claims related to traditional and limited payment long-duration contracts totaled $48.2 billion. \nThe future policy benefits liability related to these products is based on estimates of how much the Company will need to pay for future benefits and the amount of fees to be collected from policyholders for these policy features. As described in Note 10, there is uncertainty inherent in estimating this liability because there is a significant amount of management judgment involved in developing certain assumptions that impact the liability balance, which include mortality rates, and lapse termination rates.\nAuditing the valuation of future policy benefits liabilities related to these products was complex and required the involvement of our actuarial specialist due to the high degree of judgment used by management in setting the assumptions used in the estimate of the future policy benefits liability related to these products.\n80\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n​\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the future policy benefits liability estimation processes, including among others, controls related to the review and approval processes that management has in place for the assumptions used in the valuation of the future policy benefits liability. This included testing controls related to management’s evaluation of the need to update assumptions based on the comparison of actual company experience to previous assumptions. \nWe involved actuarial specialists to assist with our audit procedures which included, among others, an evaluation of the methodology applied by management with those methods used in prior periods. To assess the significant assumptions used by management, we compared the significant assumptions noted above to historical experience, industry data or management’s estimates of prospective changes in these assumptions. In addition, we performed an independent recalculation of cash flows related to the future policy benefit reserves for a sample of cohorts or contracts which we compared to the actuarial model used by management.\n​\n​\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\n​\n​\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1967.\n​\n​\n​\nDes Moines, Iowa\n​\nFebruary 19, 2025\n​\n​\n​\n81\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, \n​\nDecember 31, \n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n​\n​\n​\n(in millions, except share amounts)\n​\nAssets\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFixed maturities, available-for-sale (1)\n​\n$\n \n68,251.0\n​\n$\n \n65,673.1\n​\nFixed maturities, trading (2024 and 2023 include $\n205.9\n million and $\n81.2\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities)\n​\n​\n \n1,023.3\n​\n \n \n836.2\n​\nEquity securities (2024 and 2023 include $\n367.9\n million and $\n394.4\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities)\n​\n​\n \n2,295.0\n​\n \n \n1,478.1\n​\nMortgage loans (2024 and 2023 include $\n944.5\n million and $\n871.9\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities and $\n140.6\n million and $\n0.0\n million measured at fair value under the fair value option)\n​\n​\n \n20,484.2\n​\n \n \n20,142.8\n​\nReal estate (2024 and 2023 include $\n781.8\n million and $\n779.1\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities)\n​\n​\n \n2,464.5\n​\n \n \n2,345.3\n​\nPolicy loans\n​\n​\n \n867.5\n​\n \n \n809.3\n​\nOther investments (2024 and 2023 include $\n625.6\n million and $\n596.4\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities and $\n129.0\n million and $\n163.2\n million measured at fair value under the fair value option) \n​\n​\n \n7,990.3\n​\n \n \n7,035.6\n​\nTotal investments\n​\n​\n \n103,375.8\n​\n \n \n98,320.4\n​\nCash and cash equivalents (2024 and 2023 include $\n86.1\n million and $\n83.6\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities)\n​\n​\n \n4,211.9\n​\n \n \n4,707.7\n​\nAccrued investment income\n​\n​\n \n828.6\n​\n \n \n786.2\n​\nReinsurance recoverable and deposit receivable\n​\n​\n \n19,490.1\n​\n​\n \n20,611.7\n​\nPremiums due and other receivables\n​\n​\n \n3,771.5\n​\n \n \n3,998.8\n​\nDeferred acquisition costs\n​\n​\n \n4,006.9\n​\n \n \n3,950.5\n​\nMarket risk benefit asset\n​\n​\n \n199.5\n​\n​\n \n153.4\n​\nProperty and equipment\n​\n​\n \n769.4\n​\n \n \n938.4\n​\nGoodwill\n​\n​\n \n1,549.7\n​\n \n \n1,608.5\n​\nOther intangibles\n​\n​\n \n1,389.9\n​\n \n \n1,469.8\n​\nSeparate account assets (2024 and 2023 include $\n32,802.2\n million and $\n34,688.3\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities)\n​\n​\n \n173,327.1\n​\n \n \n167,605.6\n​\nOther assets\n​\n​\n \n743.2\n​\n \n \n895.7\n​\nTotal assets\n​\n$\n \n313,663.6\n​\n$\n \n305,046.7\n​\nLiabilities\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nContractholder funds\n​\n$\n \n43,099.6\n​\n$\n \n41,501.1\n​\nFuture policy benefits and claims\n​\n​\n \n48,179.4\n​\n \n \n46,826.5\n​\nMarket risk benefit liability\n​\n​\n \n62.1\n​\n​\n \n133.2\n​\nOther policyholder funds\n​\n​\n \n966.4\n​\n \n \n916.8\n​\nShort-term debt (2024 and 2023 include $\n119.0\n million and $\n2.5\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities)\n​\n​\n \n152.7\n​\n \n \n61.1\n​\nLong-term debt\n​\n​\n \n3,955.3\n​\n \n \n3,930.9\n​\nIncome taxes currently payable\n​\n​\n \n8.6\n​\n \n \n11.9\n​\nDeferred income taxes\n​\n​\n \n1,706.0\n​\n \n \n1,613.3\n​\nSeparate account liabilities (2024 and 2023 include $\n32,802.2\n million and $\n34,688.3\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities)\n​\n​\n \n173,327.1\n​\n \n \n167,605.6\n​\nFunds withheld payable\n​\n​\n \n18,103.7\n​\n​\n \n19,629.5\n​\nOther liabilities (2024 and 2023 include $\n108.8\n million and $\n87.7\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities)\n​\n​\n \n12,633.7\n​\n \n \n11,606.2\n​\nTotal liabilities\n​\n​\n \n302,194.6\n​\n \n \n293,836.1\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest (2024 and 2023 include $\n309.9\n million and $\n226.4\n million related to consolidated variable interest entities)\n​\n​\n \n337.7\n​\n \n \n248.9\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nStockholders’ equity\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCommon stock, par value $\n0.01\n per share;

See “Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements” for additional details. Our estimates and assumptions could change in the future. Our results of operations and financial condition may also be impacted by other uncertainties including evolving regulatory, legislative and standard-setter accounting interpretations and guidance.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we implemented changes to our Principal Asset Management segment to align the global operations by business function. See Note 20, Segment Information, for more information.\nConsolidation\nWe have relationships with various special purpose entities and other legal entities that must be evaluated to determine if the entities meet the criteria of a VIE or a voting interest entity (“VOE”). This assessment is performed by reviewing contractual, ownership and other rights, including involvement of related parties, and requires use of judgment. First, we determine if we hold a variable interest in an entity by assessing if we have the right to receive expected losses and expected residual returns of the entity. If we hold a variable interest, then the entity is assessed to determine if it is a VIE. An entity is a VIE if the equity at risk is not sufficient to support its activities, if the equity holders lack a controlling financial interest or if the entity is structured with non-substantive voting rights. In addition to the previous criteria, if the entity is a limited partnership or similar entity, it is a VIE if the limited partners do not have the power to direct the entity’s most significant activities through substantive kick-out rights or participating rights. A VIE is evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise with (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When we are the primary beneficiary, we are required to consolidate the entity in our financial statements. We reassess our involvement with VIEs on a quarterly basis. For further information about VIEs, refer to Note 3, Variable Interest Entities.\nIf an entity is not a VIE, it is considered a VOE. VOEs are generally consolidated if we own a greater than 50% voting interest. If we determine our involvement in an entity no longer meets the requirements for consolidation under either the VIE or VOE models, the entity is deconsolidated. Entities in which we have management influence over the operating and financing decisions but are not required to consolidate, other than investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option, are reported using the equity method.\n​\n87\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1.

Cash flow assumptions are reviewed at least annually and updated when necessary with the impact recognized in net income. Discount rate assumptions are prescribed as the current upper-medium grade (low credit risk) fixed income instrument yield and are updated quarterly with the impact recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). \n2.\nMarket risk benefits (“MRBs”), which are contracts or contract features that provide protection to the policyholder from capital market risk and expose us to other-than-nominal capital market risk, are measured at fair value. The periodic change in fair value is recognized in net income with the exception of the periodic change in fair value related to our own nonperformance risk, which is recognized in OCI. \nJanuary 1, 2023\nThis guidance changed how we account for many of our insurance and annuity products.\nThe additional disclosure requirements can be found in the following notes:\n●\nNote 7, Deferred Acquisition Costs and Other Actuarial Balances\n●\nNote 8, Separate Account Balances\n●\nNote 9, Contractholder Funds\n●\nNote 10, Future Policy Benefits and Claims\n●\nNote 11, Market Risk Benefits\n​\n88\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1.

An entity could elect to apply the changes retrospectively. The guidance for MRBs was applied retrospectively.\n​\n​\n​\nTroubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures\nThis authoritative guidance eliminated the accounting requirements for troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) by creditors and enhanced the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructuring by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The update required entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. The amendments in this update were applied prospectively, except for the transition method related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs, for which an entity had the option to apply a modified retrospective transition method. Early adoption was permitted.\nJanuary 1, 2023\nThis guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n​\n89\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nDescription\nDate of\nadoption\nEffect on our consolidated\nfinancial statements or other\nsignificant matters\nTargeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities – portfolio layer method \nThis authoritative guidance is intended to further align the economics of a company’s risk management activities in its financial statements with hedge accounting requirements. The guidance expanded the current single-layer method to allow multiple hedge layers of a single closed portfolio. Non-prepayable assets can also be included in the same portfolio. This guidance also clarified the current guidance on accounting for fair value basis adjustments applicable to both a single hedged layer and multiple hedged layers. Upon adoption, the application of these hedge strategies was applied prospectively. Early adoption was permitted.\n​\nJanuary 1, 2023\nThis guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFacilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting\nThis authoritative guidance provided optional expedients and exceptions for contracts and hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform. An entity could elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by reference rate reform and instead account for the modified contract as a continuation of the existing contract. Also, an entity could apply optional expedients to continue hedge accounting for hedging relationships in which the critical terms changed due to reference rate reform. This guidance eased the financial reporting impacts of reference rate reform on contracts and hedging relationships and was effective until December 31, 2022. A subsequent amendment issued in December 2022 extended the relief date from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, and was effective upon issuance.\nMarch 12, 2020\nWe adopted the guidance upon issuance prospectively and elected the applicable optional expedients and exceptions for contracts and hedging relationships impacted by reference rate reform through December 31, 2024. The guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\n​\nWhen we adopt new accounting standards, we have a process in place to perform a thorough review of the pronouncement, identify the financial statement and system impacts and create an implementation plan among our impacted business units to ensure we are compliant with the pronouncement on the date of adoption. This includes having effective processes and controls in place to support the reported amounts. Each of the standards listed above is in varying stages in our implementation process based on its issuance and adoption dates. We are on track to implement guidance by the respective effective dates.\n90\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nLong-Duration Insurance Contracts Disclosures\nWe include disaggregated rollforwards for DAC, the unearned revenue liability, separate account liabilities, policyholder account balances, the liability for future policy benefits, the additional liability for certain benefit features and MRBs. Further, for certain actuarial balances, disclosures are required for the significant inputs, judgments, assumptions and methods used in measurement, including changes in those inputs, judgments and assumptions, and the effect of those changes on measurement. \nAmounts from different reportable segments cannot be aggregated for disclosures. Factors to consider in determining the level of aggregation for disclosures include the type of coverage, geography and market or type of customer. We have identified the following levels of aggregation for long-duration insurance contract disclosures.\n●\nRetirement and Income Solutions:\no\nWorkplace savings and retirement solutions – Group annuity contracts offered to the plan sponsors of defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans\no\nIndividual variable annuities – Variable deferred annuities and registered index-linked annuities (“RILAs”) offered to individuals for both qualified and nonqualified retirement savings\no\nPension risk transfer – Single premium group annuities offered to pension plan sponsors and other institutions\no\nIndividual fixed deferred annuities – An exited business that offered single premium deferred annuity contracts and flexible premium deferred annuities (“FPDAs”) to individuals for both qualified and nonqualified retirement savings\no\nIndividual fixed income annuities – An exited business that offered single premium immediate annuities (“SPIAs”) and deferred income annuities (“DIAs”) to individuals for both qualified and nonqualified retirement savings; also includes supplementary contracts generated by annuitizations from other individual product lines\no\nInvestment only – Primarily guaranteed investment contracts (“GICs”) and funding agreements offered to retirement plan sponsors and other institutions\n●\nPrincipal Asset Management – International Pension\no\nLatin America:\n◾\nIndividual fixed income annuities – SPIAs offered to individuals \n◾\nPension – Certain retirement accumulation products where the segregated funds and associated obligation to the client are consolidated within our financial statements as separate account assets and liabilities and are only in the scope of long-duration insurance contracts disclosures for separate accounts\no\nAsia:\n◾\nGuaranteed pension – Pension savings schemes offered to both employers and employees, which were closed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024\n●\nBenefits and Protection – Specialty Benefits:\no\nIndividual disability – Disability insurance providing protection to individuals and/or business owners\n91\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\n●\nBenefits and Protection – Life Insurance:\no\nUniversal life – Universal life, variable universal life and indexed universal life insurance products offered to individuals and/or business owners, which will be collectively referred to hereafter as “universal life” contracts; includes our exited universal life insurance with secondary guarantee (“ULSG”) business\no\nTerm life – Term life insurance products offered to individuals and/or business owners\no\nParticipating life – Participating life insurance contracts offered to individuals, some of which are part of a closed block of business and are only in the scope of long-duration insurance contracts disclosures for DAC\n●\nCorporate:\no\nLong-term care insurance – A closed block of long-term care insurance that is fully reinsured, which was offered on both a group and individual basis.\nFor the separate account liability disclosures, our Retirement and Income Solutions segment uses a Group retirement contracts level of aggregation. This consists primarily of separate account liabilities for the workplace savings and retirement solutions business as well as amounts for the investment only and pension risk transfer businesses.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires management to make \nestimates\n and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. These estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\n●\nthe fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n●\ninvestment impairments and valuation allowances;\n●\nthe fair value of derivatives;\n●\nthe fair value of MRBs;\n●\nthe measurement of goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets, finite lived intangible assets and related impairments or amortization, if any; \n●\nthe liability for future policy benefits and claims, including the deferred profit liability;\n●\nthe value of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and\n●\naccounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets.\nA description of such critical estimates is incorporated within the discussion of the related accounting policies that follow. In applying these policies, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nClosed Block\nPrincipal Life Insurance Company (“Principal Life”) operates a closed block (“Closed Block”) for the benefit of individual participating dividend-paying policies in force at the time of the 1998 mutual insurance holding company (“MIHC”) formation. See Note 6, Closed Block, for further details.\n92\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, money market instruments and other debt issues with a maturity date of \nthree months\n or less when purchased.\nInvestments\nFixed maturities include bonds, asset-backed securities (“ABS”), redeemable preferred stock and certain non-redeemable preferred securities. Equity securities include mutual funds, common stock, non-redeemable preferred stock and required regulatory investments. We classify fixed maturities as either available-for-sale or trading at the time of the purchase and, accordingly, carry them at fair value. Equity securities are also carried at fair value. See Note 18, Fair Value Measurements, for methodologies related to the determination of fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to fixed maturities, available-for-sale, excluding those in fair value hedging relationships, are reflected in stockholders’ equity, net of adjustments associated with related actuarial balances, derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships and applicable income taxes. Mark-to-market adjustments on certain equity securities and mark-to-market adjustments on certain fixed maturities, trading are reflected in net realized capital gains (losses). Mark-to-market adjustments on certain fixed maturities, trading are reflected in market risk benefit remeasurement (gain) loss. Unrealized gains and losses related to hedged portions of fixed maturities, available-for-sale in fair value hedging relationships are reflected in net investment income. Mark-to-market adjustments related to certain securities carried at fair value with an investment objective to realize economic value through mark-to-market changes are reflected in net investment income.\nThe amortized cost of fixed maturities includes cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts, computed using the interest method. The amortized cost of fixed maturities, available-for-sale is adjusted for changes in fair value of the hedged portions of securities in fair value hedging relationships and excludes accrued interest receivable. Accrued interest receivable is reported in accrued investment income on the consolidated statements of financial position. Fixed maturities, available-for-sale are subject to an allowance for credit loss and changes in the allowance are reported in net income as a component of net realized capital gains (losses). Interest income, as well as prepayment fees and the amortization of the related premium or discount, is reported in net investment income. For loan-backed and structured securities, we recognize income using a constant effective yield based on currently anticipated cash flows.\nCommercial and residential mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. Amortized cost excludes accrued interest receivable. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan’s contractual interest rate. Interest income, as well as prepayment of fees and the amortization of the related premium or discount, is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest receivable is reported in accrued investment income on the consolidated statements of financial position. Any changes in the loan valuation allowances are reported in net realized capital gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 4, Investments, for further details of our valuation allowance.\nOur commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios can include loans that have been modified. We assess loan modifications on a case-by-case basis to evaluate whether a change to the valuation allowance and/or write-off is needed. See Note 4, Investments, under the caption “Mortgage Loan Modifications” for further details. Prior to the implementation of authoritative guidance in 2023, we assessed loan modifications to determine if a TDR had occurred. See Note 4, Investments, under the caption “Troubled Debt Restructuring” for further details.\nReal estate investments are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. The initial cost bases of properties acquired through loan foreclosures are the lower of the fair market values of the properties at the time of foreclosure or the outstanding loan balance. Buildings and land improvements are generally depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of improvements and tenant improvement costs are depreciated on the straight-line method over the term of the related lease. We recognize impairment losses for properties when indicators of impairment are present and a property’s expected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the property’s carrying value. In such cases, the cost basis of the property is reduced to fair value. Real estate expected to be disposed is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with valuation allowances established accordingly and depreciation no longer recognized. The carrying amount of real estate held for sale was $\n219.3\n million and $\n230.6\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Any impairment losses and any changes in valuation allowances are reported in net income.\n93\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nNet realized capital gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on the basis of specific identification. In general, in addition to realized capital gains and losses on investment sales and periodic settlements on derivatives not designated as hedges, we report gains and losses related to the following in net realized capital gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations: mark-to-market adjustments on certain equity securities, mark-to-market adjustments on certain fixed maturities, trading, mark-to-market adjustments on sponsored investment funds, mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives not designated as hedges, cash flow hedge gains (losses) when the hedged item impacts realized capital gains (losses), changes in the valuation allowance for fixed maturities, available-for-sale and certain financing receivables, impairments of real estate held for investment and impairments of equity method investments. Investment gains and losses on sales of certain real estate held for sale due to investment strategy and mark-to-market adjustments on certain securities carried at fair value with an investment objective to realize economic value through mark-to-market changes are reported as net investment income and are excluded from net realized capital gains (losses).\nPolicy loans and certain other investments are reported at cost. Interests in unconsolidated entities, joint ventures and partnerships are generally accounted for using the equity method. We had certain real estate ventures for which the fair value option had been elected in prior periods. See Note 18, Fair Value Measurements, for detail on these investments.\nDerivatives\nOverview\nDerivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities. Derivatives generally used by us include swaps, options, futures and forwards. Derivative positions are either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position and are measured at fair value, generally by obtaining quoted market prices or through the use of pricing models. See Note 18, Fair Value Measurements, for policies related to the determination of fair value. Fair values can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, values of securities, credit spreads, and market volatility and liquidity.\nAccounting and Financial Statement Presentation\nWe designate derivatives as either:\n(a)\na hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, including those denominated in a foreign currency (“fair value hedge”);\n(b)\na hedge of a forecasted transaction or the exposure to variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability, including those denominated in a foreign currency (“cash flow hedge”);\n(c)\na hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation or\n(d)\na derivative not designated as a hedging instrument.\nOur accounting for the ongoing changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the designation, as described above, and is determined when the derivative contract is entered into or at the time of redesignation. Hedge accounting is used for derivatives that are specifically designated in advance as hedges and that reduce our exposure to an indicated risk by having a high correlation between changes in the value of the derivatives and the items being hedged at both the inception of the hedge and throughout the hedge period. Cash flows associated with derivatives are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, with the exception of cash paid for certain options with deferred premiums. Those derivatives are included in payments for financing element derivatives within financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n94\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nFair Value Hedges.\n When a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk, are reported in the same consolidated statements of operations line item that is used to report the earnings effect of the hedged item. For fair value hedges of fixed maturities, available-for-sale, these changes in fair value are reported in net investment income or net realized capital gains (losses). For fair value hedges of liabilities, changes in fair value are reported in cost of interest credited. The change in the fair value of excluded components is recorded in OCI and is recognized in net income through periodic settlements. A fair value hedge determined to be highly effective may still result in a mismatch between the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Certain fair value hedges use the portfolio layer method to hedge a designated layer amount within a closed portfolio of prepayable assets that is expected to remain outstanding for the length of the hedging relationship and is not expected to be impacted by prepayments, defaults or other factors that affect the timing and amount of cash flows. Prepayment risk is excluded when measuring the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk under the portfolio layer method.\nCash Flow Hedges.\n When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value are recorded as a component of OCI. At the time the variability of cash flows being hedged impacts net income, the related portion of deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument is reclassified and reported in net income.\nNet Investment in a Foreign Operation Hedge. \nWhen a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its change in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, is recorded as a component of OCI. If the foreign operation is sold or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation, the deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument are reclassified into net income.\nNon-Hedge Derivatives.\n If a derivative does not qualify or is not designated for hedge accounting, all changes in fair value are reported in net income without considering the changes in the fair value of the economically associated assets or liabilities.\nHedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing.\n At inception, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes associating all derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges with specific assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position or with specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Documentation of fair value hedges that use the portfolio layer method supports the expectation that the hedged layer amount is anticipated to be outstanding at the end of the hedging relationship and includes expectations of prepayments, defaults or other factors that affect the timing and amount of cash flows. Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship. Even if a hedge is determined to be highly effective, the hedge may still result in a mismatch between the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\nWe use qualitative and quantitative methods to assess hedge effectiveness. Qualitative methods may include monitoring changes to terms and conditions and counterparty credit ratings. Quantitative methods may include statistical tests including regression analysis and minimum variance and dollar offset techniques. For portfolio layer method hedges, the assessment of hedge effectiveness includes confirming we expect the hedged layer amount to be outstanding at the end of the hedging relationship.\nTermination of Hedge Accounting.\n We prospectively discontinue hedge accounting when (1) the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting is no longer met, e.g., a derivative is determined to no longer be highly effective in offsetting the change in fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; (2) the derivative expires, is sold, terminated or exercised or (3) we remove the designation of the derivative being the hedging instrument for a fair value or cash flow hedge.\n95\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nIf it is determined that a derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, the derivative will continue to be carried on the consolidated statements of financial position at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized prospectively in net realized capital gains (losses). The asset or liability under a fair value hedge will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value pursuant to hedging rules and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to the consolidated statements of operations line associated with the asset or liability. If a portfolio layer method hedging relationship is discontinued, the outstanding basis adjustment is allocated to the individual assets in the closed portfolio and those amounts are amortized consistent with the amortization of other discounts or premiums associated with those assets.\nThe component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) related to discontinued cash flow hedges that are no longer highly effective is amortized to the consolidated statements of operations consistent with the net income impacts of the original hedged cash flows. If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is probable the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the deferred gain or loss is immediately reclassified from AOCI into net income.\nEmbedded Derivatives.\n We purchase and issue certain financial instruments and products that contain a derivative that is embedded in the financial instrument or product. We assess whether this embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the asset or liability that serves as its host contract. If we deem that the embedded derivative’s terms are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the derivative is bifurcated from that contract and held at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial position, with changes in fair value reported in net income.\nContractholder and Policyholder Liabilities\nContractholder and policyholder liabilities (contractholder funds, future policy benefits and claims, MRBs and other policyholder funds) include reserves for investment contracts, individual and group annuities that provide periodic income payments, universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, indexed universal life insurance, term life insurance, participating traditional individual life insurance, group dental and vision insurance, group critical illness, group accident, group hospital indemnity, paid family and medical leave (“PFML”), group short-term and long-term disability insurance, group life insurance, individual disability insurance and long-term care insurance. It also includes a provision for dividends on participating policies.\nInvestment contracts are contractholders’ funds on deposit with us and generally include reserves for pension and annuity contracts. Reserves on investment contracts are equal to the cumulative deposits less any applicable charges and withdrawals plus credited interest. Reserves for universal life, variable universal life and indexed universal life insurance contracts are equal to cumulative deposits less charges plus credited interest, which represents the account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders. See Note 9, Contractholder Funds, for additional details.\nWe hold additional reserves on certain long-duration contracts where benefit features result in gains in early years followed by losses in later years and universal life, variable universal life and indexed universal life insurance contracts that contain no lapse guarantee features.\nRefer to Note 10, Future Policy Benefits and Claims, under the caption “Long-Duration Contracts” for information about the calculation of reserves for long-duration insurance and annuity contracts.\nContracts or contract features that provide protection to the policyholder from capital market risk and expose us to other than nominal capital market risk are classified as MRBs and reported at fair value. See Note 11, Market Risk Benefits, for additional details.\nReserves for participating life insurance contracts are based on the net level premium reserve for death and endowment policy benefits. This net level premium reserve is calculated based on dividend fund interest rates and mortality rates guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in the contract.\n96\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nParticipating business represented approximately \n2\n%, \n3\n% and \n3\n% of our life insurance in force and \n15\n%, \n16\n% and \n17\n% of the number of life insurance policies in force as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Participating business represented approximately \n15\n%, \n16\n% and \n17\n% of life insurance premiums for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of dividends to policyholders is declared annually by Principal Life’s Board of Directors. The amount of dividends to be paid to policyholders is determined after consideration of several factors including interest, mortality, morbidity and other expense experience for the year and judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be retained by Principal Life. At the end of the reporting period, Principal Life establishes a dividend liability for the pro rata portion of the dividends expected to be paid on or before the next policy anniversary date.\nSome of our policies and contracts require payment of fees or other policyholder assessments in advance for services that will be rendered over the estimated lives of the policies and contracts. See Note 7, Deferred Acquisition Costs and Other Actuarial Balances, under the caption “Unearned Revenue Liability” for additional details.\nShort-Duration Contracts\nWe include the following group products in our short-duration insurance contracts disclosures: long-term disability (“LTD”), group life waiver, dental, vision, short-term disability (“STD”), critical illness, accident, PFML, hospital indemnity and group life. Refer to Note 10, Future Policy Benefits and Claims, under the caption “Short-Duration Contracts” for additional details.\nLiability for Unpaid Claims\nThe liability for unpaid claims for both long-duration and short-duration contracts is an estimate of the ultimate net cost of reported and unreported losses not yet settled. This liability is estimated using actuarial analyses and case basis evaluations. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, we believe the liability for unpaid claims is adequate. These estimates are continually reviewed and, as adjustments to this liability become necessary, such adjustments are reflected in net income.\nWe incur claim adjustment expenses for both long-duration and short-duration contracts that cannot be allocated to a specific claim. Our claim adjustment expense liability is estimated using actuarial analyses based on historical trends of expenses and expected claim runout patterns.  \nSee Note 10, Future Policy Benefits and Claims, under the caption “Liability for Unpaid Claims” for further details.\nRecognition of Premiums and Other Considerations, Fees and Other Revenues and Benefits\nProducts with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits consist principally of whole life and term life insurance policies and individual disability income. Premiums from these products are recognized as premium revenue when due. Related policy benefits and expenses for individual life products are associated with earned premiums and result in the recognition of profits over the expected term of the policies and contracts.\nImmediate annuities with life contingencies include products with fixed and guaranteed annuity considerations and benefits and consist principally of group and individual single premium annuities with life contingencies. Annuity considerations from these products are recognized as premium revenue. However, the collection of these annuity considerations does not represent the completion of the earnings process, as we establish annuity reserves using estimates for mortality and interest assumptions. We anticipate profits to emerge over the life of the annuity products as we earn investment income, pay benefits and release reserves. Any gross premium received in excess of the net premium is recognized as a deferred profit liability and amortized in relation to the expected future benefit payments. See Note 10, Future Policy Benefits and Claims, for additional details.\nGroup life, dental, vision, critical illness, accident, PFML, hospital indemnity and disability premiums are generally recorded as premium revenue over the term of the coverage. Certain group contracts contain experience premium refund provisions based on a pre-defined formula that reflects their claim experience. Experience premium refunds reduce revenue over the term of the coverage and are adjusted to reflect current experience. Related policy benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums and result in the recognition of profits over the term of the policies and contracts. Fees for contracts providing claim processing or other administrative services are recorded as revenue over the period the service is provided.\n97\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nUniversal life-type policies are insurance contracts with terms that are not fixed. Amounts received as payments for such contracts are not reported as premium revenues. Revenues for universal life-type insurance contracts consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy initiation and administration, surrender charges and other fees that have been assessed against policy account values and investment income. Policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense include interest credited to contracts and benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of related policy account balances.\nInvestment contracts do not subject us to significant risks arising from policyholder mortality or morbidity and consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts (“GICs”), funding agreements and certain deferred annuities. Amounts received as payments for investment contracts are established as investment contract liability balances and are not reported as premium revenues. Revenues for investment contracts consist of investment income and policy administration charges. Investment contract benefits that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of related investment contract liability balances and interest credited to investment contract liability balances.\nFees and other revenues are earned for asset management, investment advisory and distribution services provided to retail and institutional clients based largely upon contractual rates applied to the specified amounts in the clients’ portfolios, which include various platforms such as mutual funds, collective investment trusts and business trusts. Additionally, fees and other revenues are earned for administrative services performed including recordkeeping, trust and custody and reporting services for retirement savings plans, insurance companies, endowments and other financial institutions and other products. Fees and other revenues received for performance of asset management and administrative services are recognized as revenue when earned, typically when the service is performed.\nFees for managing customers’ mandatory retirement savings accounts in Chile are collected with each monthly deposit made by our customers. If a customer stops contributing before retirement age, we collect no fees but services are still provided. We recognize revenue from these long-term service contracts as services are performed over the life of the contract.  \nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nRefer to Note 7, Deferred Acquisition Costs and Other Actuarial Balances, for information related to DAC on insurance policies and investment contracts. Commissions and other incremental direct costs for the acquisition of long-term service contracts are also capitalized to the extent recoverable.\nInternal Replacement Transactions\nAll insurance and investment contract modifications and replacements are reviewed to determine if the internal replacement results in a substantially changed contract. If so, the acquisition costs, sales inducements and unearned revenue associated with the new contract are deferred and amortized over the lifetime of the new contract. In addition, the existing DAC, sales inducement costs and unearned revenue balances associated with the replaced contract are written off. If an internal replacement results in a substantially unchanged contract, the acquisition costs, sales inducements and unearned revenue associated with the new contract are immediately recognized in the period incurred. In addition, the existing DAC, sales inducement costs or unearned revenue balance associated with the replaced contract is not written off, but instead is carried over to the new contract. \nLong-Term Debt\nLong-term debt includes notes payable, nonrecourse mortgages and other debt with a maturity date greater than \none year\n at the date of issuance. Current maturities of long-term debt are classified as long-term debt in our consolidated statements of financial position. Long-term debt is primarily recorded at the unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized discount, premium and issuance costs.\n98\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nReinsurance\nWe enter into reinsurance agreements with other companies in the normal course of business in order to limit losses and minimize exposure to significant risks.\nWe evaluate each insurance agreement to determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability related to insurance risk. For agreements that expose the reinsurer to reasonable possibility of significant loss from insurance risk, the reinsurance method of accounting is used for the agreement. Assets and liabilities related to reinsurance ceded are reported on a gross basis on the consolidated statements of financial position. Insurance liabilities are reported before the effects of reinsurance and we record an offsetting reinsurance recoverable, net of valuation allowance. Premiums and expenses are reported net of reinsurance ceded on the consolidated statements of operations.  \nIf an agreement does not expose the reinsurer to reasonable possibility of significant loss from insurance risk, the deposit method of accounting is used for the agreement. We record a deposit receivable, net of valuation allowance, if necessary. The deposit receivable is adjusted as amounts are paid or received on the underlying contracts. Accretion on the deposit receivable is calculated using an effective interest method and is reported in fees and other revenues and operating expense on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe cost of reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is amortized over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.\nWe have entered into coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements in which we record a funds withheld payable that contains an embedded derivative for which the fair value is estimated based on the change in fair value of the assets supporting the funds withheld payable. The change in fair value of the funds withheld embedded derivative is separately reported on the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses that do not flow to the reinsurer are reported in net realized capital gains (losses) on funds withheld assets on the consolidated statements of operations.\nFor further information about reinsurance, refer to Note 12, Reinsurance. For further information about the financing receivables valuation allowance on the reinsurance recoverable and deposit receivable, refer to Note 4, Investments.\nSeparate Accounts\nRefer to Note 8, Separate Account Balances, for information on our separate account assets and liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file a U.S. consolidated income tax return that includes all of our qualifying subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in all states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Our policy of allocating income tax expenses and benefits to companies in the group is generally based upon pro rata contribution of taxable income or operating losses. We are taxed at corporate rates on taxable income based on existing tax laws. Current income taxes are charged or credited to net income based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year. Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences in the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards using enacted income tax rates and laws. The effect on deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in net income in the period in which the change is enacted. Subsequent to a change in tax rates and laws, any stranded tax effects remaining in AOCI will be released only if an entire portfolio is liquidated, sold or extinguished.\nForeign Exchange\nAssets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates denominated in non-U.S. dollars, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at the year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of stockholders’ equity, along with any related hedge and tax effects. Revenues and expenses for these entities are translated at the average exchange rates. Revenue, expense and other foreign currency transaction and translation adjustments that affect cash flows are reported in net income, along with related hedge and tax effects.\n99\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies – (continued)\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized. Rather, they are tested for impairment during the third quarter each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment, if financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. Once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit, it is no longer associated with a particular acquisition; therefore, all of the activities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically grown, are available to support the goodwill value.\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized as related benefits emerge and are reviewed periodically for indicators of impairment in value. If facts and circumstances suggest possible impairment, the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is compared to the current carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of assets over their fair value.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and excludes the dilutive effect of equity awards. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities, such as options and non-vested stock grants, were exercised or resulted in the issuance of common stock. For any time period in which we have a net loss available to common stockholders, we use the weighted-average number of common shares used in our basic earnings per share calculation to calculate the diluted earnings per share, as dilutive shares would have an antidilutive effect and result in a lower loss per share.\nActuarial Balance Re-Cohorting\nIn 2021, we completed a comprehensive review of our business mix and capital management options (the “Strategic Review”). We made the decision to exit our U.S. retail ULSG business. The ULSG business was previously managed together with our other universal life (“UL”) business within our Benefits and Protection segment. As such, calculations of actuarial balances included UL and ULSG in the same cohorts, which are the unit of account used for measurement. As a result of the Strategic Review, we made the decision in the second quarter of 2022 to manage the ULSG business separately from our other UL business effective as of January 1, 2022. This led to us re-cohorting the UL business, resulting in separate cohorts for the ULSG business vs. the remaining UL business.\nThe re-cohorting impacted the measurement of our cost of reinsurance and additional liability for certain benefit features. The pre-tax impacts to comprehensive income were as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nFor the year ended\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2022\n​\n​\n(in millions)\nIncrease to income before taxes\n \n​\n  \nCost of reinsurance amortization (1)\n​\n$\n \n33.7\nChange in additional liability for certain benefit features (1)\n​\n \n \n167.4\nTotal increase to income before income taxes\n​\n \n \n201.1\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease to pre-tax other comprehensive income\n​\n \n  \nCost of reinsurance unrealized losses\n​\n \n (\n2.1\n)\nChange in additional liability for certain benefit features unrealized gains\n​\n \n \n7.8\nTotal increase to pre-tax other comprehensive income\n​\n \n \n5.7\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal increase to pre-tax comprehensive income\n​\n$\n \n206.8\n(1)\nReported in liability for future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss.\n​\n​\n​\n100\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n2.

(“Cuprum”) in 2013. \n​\n​\n101\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n3. Variable Interest Entities\nWe have relationships with various types of entities which may be VIEs. Certain VIEs are consolidated in our financial results. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, under the caption “Consolidation” for further details of our consolidation accounting policies. We did not provide financial or other support to investees designated as VIEs for the periods ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nMandatory Retirement Savings Funds\nWe hold an equity interest in Chilean mandatory privatized social security funds in which we provide asset management services. We determined the mandatory privatized social security funds, which also include contributions for voluntary pension savings, voluntary non-pension savings and compensation savings accounts, are VIEs. This is because the equity holders as a group lack the power, due to voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and also because equity investors are protected from below-average market investment returns relative to the industry’s return, due to a regulatory guarantee that we provide. Further, we concluded we are the primary beneficiary through our power to make decisions and our significant variable interest in the funds. The purpose of the funds, which reside in legally segregated entities, is to provide long-term retirement savings. The obligation to the customer is directly related to the assets held in the funds and, as such, we present the assets as separate account assets and the obligation as separate account liabilities within our consolidated statements of financial position.\nPrincipal Asset Management offers retirement pension schemes in Hong Kong in which we provide trustee, administration and asset management services to employers and employees under the Hong Kong Mandatory Provident Fund and Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance pension schemes. The Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance pension scheme has various guaranteed and non-guaranteed constituent funds, or investment options, in which customers can invest their money. The guaranteed funds provide either a guaranteed rate of return to the customer or a minimum guarantee on withdrawals under certain qualifying events. We determined the guaranteed funds are VIEs due to the fact the equity holders, as a group, lack the obligation to absorb expected losses due to the guarantee we provide. We concluded we are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to make decisions and to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE. Therefore, we consolidate the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds and present as separate accounts or within the general account, depending on the terms of the guarantee. The guaranteed constituent funds offered under the Hong Kong Mandatory Provident Fund and the Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance were closed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024, respectively.\nReal Estate\nWe invest in several real estate limited partnerships and limited liability companies. The entities invest in real estate properties. Certain of these entities are VIEs based on the combination of our significant economic interest and related voting rights. We determined we are the primary beneficiary as a result of our power to control the entities through our significant ownership. Due to the nature of these real estate investments, the investment balance will fluctuate as we purchase and sell interests in the entities and as capital expenditures are made to improve the underlying real estate.\nSponsored Investment Funds\nWe sponsor and invest in certain investment funds for which we provide asset management services. Although our asset management fee is commensurate with the services provided and consistent with fees for similar services negotiated at arms-length, we have a variable interest for funds where our other interests are more than insignificant. The funds are VIEs as the equity holders lack power through voting rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance. We determined we are the primary beneficiary of the VIEs where our interest in the entity is more than insignificant and we are the asset manager.\n102\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n3. Variable Interest Entities – (continued)\nResidential Mortgage Loans\nWe invest in ABS trusts. The trusts issue various collateralized mortgage obligation certificates and purchase residential mortgage loans. The trusts are considered VIEs due to insufficient equity to sustain themselves. We concluded we are the primary beneficiary as we purchase substantially all of the certificates and have the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. We deconsolidated trusts in 2023 as we no longer held substantially all of the certificates.\nAsset-Backed Limited Partnership\nWe invest in an ABS limited partnership. The limited partnership issues multiple notes and purchases consumer loans, auto loans, other loans and credit facilities. The limited partnership is considered a VIE due to insufficient equity to sustain itself. We concluded we are the primary beneficiary as we have purchased all of the notes and have the obligation to absorb losses and residual returns that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nAssets and Liabilities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities\nThe carrying amounts of our consolidated VIE assets, which can only be used to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs, and liabilities of consolidated VIEs for which creditors do not have recourse were as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n​\n​\nTotal\n​\nTotal\n​\nTotal\n​\nTotal\n​\n    \nassets\n    \nliabilities\n    \nassets\n    \nliabilities\n​\n​\n​\n(in millions)\nMandatory retirement savings funds (1)\n​\n$\n \n33,130.4\n​\n$\n \n32,802.2\n​\n$\n \n35,034.4\n​\n$\n \n34,688.3\nReal estate (2)\n​\n \n \n814.3\n​\n \n \n69.4\n​\n \n \n829.1\n​\n \n \n63.0\nSponsored investment funds (3)\n​\n \n \n833.7\n​\n \n \n160.3\n​\n \n \n523.8\n​\n \n \n6.3\nResidential mortgage loans (4)\n​\n​\n \n806.5\n​\n​\n \n19.9\n​\n​\n \n874.7\n​\n​\n \n20.9\nAsset-backed limited partnership (5)\n​\n​\n \n250.0\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n \n249.3\n​\n​\n—\nTotal\n​\n$\n \n35,834.9\n​\n$\n \n33,051.8\n​\n$\n \n37,511.3\n​\n$\n \n34,778.5\n(1)\nThe assets of the mandatory retirement savings funds primarily include separate account assets and equity securities.

Liabilities primarily include other liabilities.\n(3)\nThe assets of sponsored investment funds are primarily fixed maturities, equity securities, certain of which are reported with other investments, commercial mortgage loans and cash. The liabilities primarily include short-term debt, long-term debt and other liabilities. The consolidated statements of financial position included a \n$\n309.9\n million and \n$\n226.4\n million redeemable noncontrolling interest for sponsored investment funds as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n \nFor certain sponsored investment funds, we have unfunded commitments to the VIE. Unfunded commitments are not liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position because we are only required to fund additional capital when called upon to do so by the investment manager.\n(4)\nThe assets of the residential mortgage loans VIEs primarily include residential mortgage loans. The liabilities primarily include other liabilities.\n(5)\nThe assets of the asset-backed limited partnership VIE primarily include consumer loans, auto loans, other loans and credit facilities. These assets are reported with cash and cash equivalents,other investments and fixed maturities, trading on the consolidated statements of financial position.\n​\n103\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n3. Variable Interest Entities – (continued)\nUnconsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nWe hold a variable interest in a number of VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. Our investments in these VIEs are reported in fixed maturities, available-for-sale; fixed maturities, trading; equity securities and other investments in the consolidated statements of financial position and are described below.\nUnconsolidated VIEs include certain commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities (“RMBS”) and other ABS. All of these entities were deemed VIEs because the equity within these entities is insufficient to sustain them. We determined we are not the primary beneficiary in the entities within these categories of investments. This determination was based primarily on the fact we do not own the class of security that controls the unilateral right to replace the special servicer or equivalent function.\nWe invest in cash collateralized debt obligations, collateralized bond obligations, collateralized loan obligations and other collateralized structures, which are VIEs due to insufficient equity to sustain the entities. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities primarily because we do not control the economic performance of the entities and were not involved with the design of the entities or because we do not have a potentially significant variable interest in the entities for which we are the asset manager.\nWe have invested in various VIE trusts and similar entities as a debt holder. Most of these entities are classified as VIEs due to insufficient equity to sustain them. In addition, we have an entity classified as a VIE based on the combination of our significant economic interest and lack of voting rights. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary primarily because we do not control the economic performance of the entities and were not involved with the design of the entities.\nWe have invested in partnerships and other funds, which are classified as VIEs. The entities are VIEs as equity holders lack the power to control the most significant activities of the entities because the equity holders do not have either the ability by a simple majority to exercise substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary because we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the entities.\nAs previously discussed, we sponsor and invest in certain investment funds that are VIEs. We determined we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs for which we are the asset manager but do not have a potentially significant variable interest in the funds.\nWe hold an equity interest in Mexican mandatory privatized social security funds in which we provide asset management services. Our equity interest in the funds is considered a variable interest. We concluded the funds are VIEs because the equity holders as a group lack decision-making ability through their voting rights.

Investments – (continued)\nAllowance for Credit Loss\nWe have a process in place to identify fixed maturity securities that could potentially require an allowance for credit loss. This process involves monitoring market events that could impact issuers’ credit ratings, business climate, management changes, litigation and government actions and other similar factors. This process also involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels, downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.\nEach reporting period, all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine whether a decline in value is due to credit. Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent the fair value is below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events and (4) for structured securities, the adequacy of the expected cash flows. To the extent we determine an unrealized loss is due to credit, an allowance for credit loss is recognized through a reduction to net income.\nWe estimate the amount of the allowance for credit loss as the difference between amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the current yield to accrete an asset-backed or floating rate security. The methodology and assumptions for establishing the best estimate cash flows vary depending on the type of security. The ABS cash flow estimates are based on security specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds and structural support, including subordination and guarantees. The corporate security cash flow estimates are derived from scenario-based outcomes of expected corporate restructurings or liquidations using bond specific facts and circumstances including timing, security interests and loss severity. We do not measure a credit loss allowance on accrued interest receivable because we write off the accrued interest receivable balance to net investment income in a timely manner when we have concern regarding collectability.\nAmounts on fixed maturities, available-for-sale deemed to be uncollectible are written off and removed from the allowance for credit loss. A write-off may also occur if we intend to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity.\n109\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n4.

Furthermore, unrealized losses include $\n906.9\n million within the states and political subdivisions sector with an average price of \n85\n and an average credit rating of AA-; $\n645.6\n million within the CMBS sector with an average price of \n87\n and an average credit rating of AA; and $\n472.9\n million within the collateralized mortgage obligation security sector with an average price of \n85\n and an average credit rating of AAA. The unrealized losses on these securities can primarily be attributed to changes in market interest rates and changes in credit spreads since the securities were acquired. \nBecause we expected to recover our amortized cost, we did not record an allowance for credit loss on these securities as of December 31, 2023. Because it was not our intent to sell the fixed maturity available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses and it was not more likely than not that we would be required to sell these securities before recovery of the amortized cost, which may be at maturity, we did not write down these investments to fair value.\nNet Unrealized Gains and Losses on Available-For-Sale Securities and Derivative Instruments\nThe net unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities and the net unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments in cash flow hedge relationships are reported as separate components of stockholders’ equity. The cumulative amount of net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments in cash flow hedge relationships net of adjustments related to actuarial balances, policyholder liabilities, noncontrolling interest and applicable income taxes was as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nDecember 31, 2023\n \n​\n​\n(in millions)\n​\nNet unrealized losses on fixed maturities, available-for-sale (1)\n​\n$\n (\n5,942.5\n)\n​\n$\n (\n5,143.0\n)\n​\nNet unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments\n​\n​\n \n66.1\n​\n​\n (\n1.6\n)\n​\nAdjustments for assumed changes in amortization patterns\n​\n​\n \n5.1\n​\n​\n (\n5.2\n)\n​\nAdjustments for assumed changes in policyholder liabilities\n​\n​\n \n12.2\n​\n​\n \n1.4\n​\nNet unrealized gains (losses) on other investments and noncontrolling interest adjustments\n​\n​\n (\n52.5\n)\n​\n​\n \n43.1\n​\nProvision for deferred income tax benefits\n​\n​\n \n1,270.5\n​\n​\n \n1,088.4\n​\nNet unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments\n​\n$\n (\n4,641.1\n)\n​\n$\n (\n4,016.9\n)\n​\n(1)\nExcludes net unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturities, available-for-sale included in fair value hedging relationships.\n​\n113\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n4. Investments – (continued)\nFinancing Receivables\nMortgage Loans\nMortgage loans consist of commercial and residential mortgage loans. Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of non-recourse, fixed rate mortgages on stabilized properties. Our residential mortgage loan portfolio is composed of first lien and home equity mortgages concentrated in Chile and the United States.\nCommercial and residential mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. Amortized cost excludes accrued interest receivable. The amortized cost of our residential mortgage loans also includes basis adjustments related to fair value hedges in a closed portfolio. See Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further information. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan’s contractual interest rate. Interest income, as well as prepayment of fees and the amortization of the related premium or discount, is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest receivable is reported in accrued investment income on the consolidated statements of financial position. Any changes in the loan valuation allowances are reported in net realized capital gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Further details relating to our valuation allowance are included under the caption “Financing Receivables Valuation Allowance.”\nDirect Financing Leases\nOur direct financing leases are concentrated in Chile. Our Chilean operations enter into private placement contracts for commercial, industrial and office space properties whereby our Chilean operations purchase the real estate and/or building from the seller-lessee but then lease the property back to the seller-lessee. Ownership of the property is transferred to the lessee by the end of the lease term. Direct financing leases are reported as a component of other investments in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nReinsurance Recoverable and Deposit Receivable\nOur reinsurance recoverables include amounts due from reinsurers for paid or unpaid claims, claims incurred but not reported or policy benefits. We cede life, disability, medical and long-term care insurance as well as fixed annuity contracts with significant life insurance risk to other insurance companies through reinsurance. Deposit receivables include amounts due from the reinsurer for fixed annuity contracts without significant life insurance risk recorded using the deposit method of accounting.\nOther Loans\nOur other loans include consumer, auto and other loans (“other loans”) of a consolidated VIE for which the fair value option was elected as well as consumer loans for which the fair value option was not elected. Other loans are generally subject to amortized cost accounting and a valuation allowance if the fair value option is not elected. Other loans are reported as a component of other investments in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n​\n114\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n4.

All commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases are analyzed regularly and substantially all are internally rated, based on a proprietary risk rating cash flow model, in order to monitor the financial quality of these assets. The models stress expected cash flows at various levels and at different points in time depending on the durability of the income stream, which includes our assessment of factors such as location (macro and micro markets), tenant quality and lease expirations. Our internal rating analysis presents expected losses in terms of an S&P Global (“S&P”) bond equivalent rating for domestic commercial mortgage loans and Feller rate equivalent for Chilean commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases. As the credit risk for commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases increases, we adjust our internal ratings downward with loans in the category “B+ and below” having the highest risk for credit loss. Internal ratings on commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases are updated at least annually and potentially more often for certain investments with material changes in collateral value or occupancy and for investments on an internal “watch list”. \nCommercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases that require more frequent and detailed attention are identified and placed on an internal “watch list”. Among the criteria that may indicate a potential problem are significant negative changes in ratios of loan to value or contract rents to debt service, major tenant vacancies or bankruptcies, borrower sponsorship problems, late payments, delinquent taxes and loan relief/restructuring requests.\n116\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n4. Investments – (continued)\nResidential Mortgage Loan Credit Risk Profile Based on Performance Status\nOur residential mortgage loan portfolio is monitored based on performance of the loans. Monitoring on a residential mortgage loan increases when the loan is delinquent or earlier if there is an indication of potential impairment. We define non-performing domestic residential mortgage loans as loans \n90 days\n or greater delinquent or on non-accrual status. We define non-performing residential first lien mortgages in the Chilean market as loans that have missed a specified number of coupon payments based on the nature of the loans and collection practices in that market.\nOther Loans Credit Risk Profile Based on Performance Status\nOur other loans are monitored based on performance of the loans. Monitoring on other loans increases when the loan is delinquent or earlier if there is an indication of potential impairment.\nNon-Accrual Financing Receivables\nFinancing receivables are placed on non-accrual status if we have concern regarding the collectability of future payments or if a financing receivable has matured without being paid off or extended. Factors considered may include conversations with the borrower, loss of major tenant, bankruptcy of borrower or major tenant, decreased property cash flow for commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases or number of days past due and other circumstances for residential mortgage loans. Based on an assessment as to the collectability of the principal, a determination is made to apply any payments received either against the principal, against the valuation allowance or according to the contractual terms. When a financing receivable is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued unpaid interest receivable is reversed against interest income. Accrual of interest resumes after factors resulting in doubts about collectability have improved. Financing receivables in the Chilean market are carried on accrual for a longer period of delinquency than domestic financing receivables, as assessment of collectability is based on the nature of the financing receivables and collection practices in that market.\nThe amortized cost of financing receivables on non-accrual status was as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\n    \n​\n  \n    \n​\n  \n    \nAmortized cost\n​\n​\nBeginning\n​\nEnding\n​\nof nonaccrual\n​\n​\namortized cost\n​\namortized cost\n​\nassets without\n​\n​\non nonaccrual\n​\non nonaccrual\n​\na valuation\n​\n​\nstatus\n​\nstatus\n​\nallowance\n​\n \n(in millions)\nCommercial mortgage loans\n​\n$\n \n58.4\n​\n$\n \n70.5\n​\n$\n —\nResidential mortgage loans\n​\n​\n \n10.2\n​\n​\n \n15.6\n​\n​\n —\nTotal\n​\n$\n \n68.6\n​\n$\n \n86.1\n​\n$\n —\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n​\n    \n​\n  \n    \n​\n  \n    \nAmortized cost\n​\n​\nBeginning\n​\nEnding\n​\nof nonaccrual\n​\n​\namortized cost\n​\namortized cost\n​\nassets without\n​\n​\non nonaccrual\n​\non nonaccrual\n​\na valuation\n​\n​\nstatus\n​\nstatus\n​\nallowance\n​\n \n(in millions)\nCommercial mortgage loans\n​\n$\n \n50.0\n​\n$\n \n58.4\n​\n$\n —\nResidential mortgage loans\n​\n​\n \n17.8\n​\n​\n \n10.2\n​\n​\n \n0.5\nTotal\n​\n$\n \n67.8\n​\n$\n \n68.6\n​\n$\n \n0.5\n​\n117\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n4.

The valuation allowance is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated expected credit losses. The valuation allowance is based on amortized cost excluding accrued interest receivable and includes reserves for pools of financing receivables with similar risk characteristics. We do not measure a credit loss allowance on accrued interest receivable because we write off the uncollectible accrued interest receivable balance to net investment income in a timely manner, generally within 90 days domestically or, in the Chilean market, based on the nature of the loans and collection practices in that market. During 2024 and 2023, we did not write off any commercial mortgage loan accrued interest or residential mortgage loan accrued interest.\n118\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n4. Investments – (continued)\nFor commercial and residential mortgage loans and direct financing leases, management’s periodic evaluation and assessment of the valuation allowance adequacy is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, composition of the portfolio, portfolio delinquency information, underwriting standards, peer group information, current and forecasted economic conditions, loss experience and other relevant factors. For reinsurance recoverables and deposit receivables, management’s periodic evaluation and assessment of the valuation allowance adequacy is based on known and inherent risks, adverse situations that may affect a reinsurer’s ability to repay, current and forecasted economic conditions, industry loss experience and other relevant factors.\nOur commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases are pooled by risk rating level with an estimated loss ratio applied against each risk rating level. The loss ratio is generally based upon historical loss experience for each risk rating level as adjusted for certain current and forecasted environmental factors management believes to be relevant. Environmental factors are forecasted for two years or less with immediate reversion to historical experience. The allowance for direct financing leases is also adjusted for the residual value of the leased assets. A commercial mortgage loan or direct financing lease is evaluated individually if it does not continue to share similar risk characteristics of a pool. We analyze the need for an individual evaluation for any domestic commercial mortgage loan that is delinquent for \n60 days\n or more, in process of foreclosure, restructured, on the internal “watch list” or that currently is evaluated individually. We analyze the need for an individual evaluation for any Chilean commercial mortgage loan or direct financing lease that is considered past due based on collection practices in the Chilean market and the nature of the loan or lease.\nWe estimate expected credit losses for certain commercial mortgage loan or direct financing lease commitments where we have a contractual obligation to extend credit. The expected credit losses are estimated based on the commercial mortgage loan or direct financing lease valuation allowance process described previously, adjusted for probability of funding. The estimated expected credit losses for commercial mortgage loan and direct financing lease commitments are reported in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position. The change in the credit loss liability for commitments is included in net realized capital gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Once funded, expected credit losses for commercial mortgage loans or direct financing leases are included within the commercial mortgage loan or direct financing lease valuation allowance described previously.\nWe evaluate residential mortgage loans based on aggregated risk factors and historical loss experience by pool type. We adjust these quantitative factors for qualitative factors of present and forecasted conditions. Qualitative factors include items such as economic and business conditions, changes in the portfolio, value of underlying collateral and concentrations. A residential mortgage loan is evaluated individually if it does not continue to share similar risk characteristics of a pool. We analyze the need for an individual evaluation for any domestic residential mortgage loan that is delinquent for \n60 days\n or more, in process of foreclosure, restructured, on the internal “watch list” or that currently is evaluated individually. We analyze the need for an individual evaluation for any Chilean residential mortgage loan that is considered past due based on collection practices in the Chilean market and the nature of the loan.\nAs discussed previously, commercial and residential mortgage loans and direct financing leases are evaluated individually if the asset does not continue to share similar risk characteristics of a pool. When we determine a commercial or residential mortgage loan is probable of foreclosure, a valuation allowance is established equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value of the collateral reduced by the cost to sell. For certain commercial mortgage loans where repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, we elect to establish a valuation allowance equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value of the real estate collateral, which may be reduced by the cost to sell. Estimated value may also be based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the asset’s effective interest rate or the asset’s observable market price. Subsequent changes in the estimated value are reflected in the valuation allowance. Amounts on financing receivables deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and removed from the valuation allowance. The change in the valuation allowance for loans and direct financing leases is included in net realized capital gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations.\n119\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n4.

The loss ratio is generally based upon industry historical loss experience and expected recovery timing as adjusted for certain current and forecasted environmental factors management believes to be relevant. Environmental factors are forecasted for five years or less with immediate reversion to industry historical experience. A reinsurance recoverable or deposit receivable is evaluated individually if it does not continue to share similar risk characteristics of a pool. We analyze the need for an individual evaluation for any reinsurance recoverable or deposit receivable based on past due payments and changes in reinsurer risk ratings.

Investments – (continued)\nThe financing receivables valuation allowance utilizes an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and it is recorded on each loan upon origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the valuation allowance is historical loss information, which includes losses from modification of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the valuation allowance because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the valuation allowance is generally not recorded upon modification.\nOccasionally, a modification of a loan from a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is in the form of principal forgiveness. When principal forgiveness is provided as a modification, the amount of the principal forgiven is deemed uncollectible. Therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, which results in a reduction of the amortized cost and a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance.\nIn some cases, we modify a loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness may be granted.\nWe did not have any significant mortgage loans that were modified for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTroubled Debt Restructuring\nPrior to the implementation of authoritative guidance in 2023, we assessed loan modifications on a case-by-case basis to evaluate whether a TDR has occurred. When we had commercial mortgage loan TDRs, they were modified to delay or reduce principal payments and to reduce or delay interest payments. The commercial mortgage loan modifications result in delayed cash receipts, a decrease in interest income and loan rates that were considered below market. When we had residential mortgage loan TDRs, they included modifications of interest-only payment periods, delays in principal balloon payments and interest rate reductions. Residential mortgage loan modifications resulted in delayed or decreased cash receipts and a decrease in interest income.\nWhen we had commercial mortgage loan TDRs, they were reserved for in the mortgage loan valuation allowance at the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral reduced by the cost to sell.\nWhen we had residential mortgage loan TDRs, they were specifically reserved for in the mortgage loan valuation allowance if losses resulted from the modification. Residential mortgage loans that had defaulted or had been discharged through bankruptcy were reduced to the expected collectible amount.\nThe following table includes information about outstanding loans that were modified and met the criteria of a TDR during the periods indicated.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022\n​\n    \nTDRs\n    \nTDRs in payment default\n​\n    \nNumber of\n    \nRecorded\n​\nNumber of\n​\nRecorded\n​\n    \ncontracts\n    \ninvestment\n    \ncontracts\n    \ninvestment\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(in millions)\n​\n​\n \n​\n(in millions)\nCommercial mortgage loans\n​\n \n1\n​\n$\n \n35.5\n​\n —\n​\n$\n —\nTotal\n​\n \n1\n​\n$\n \n35.5\n​\n —\n​\n$\n —\n​\nReal Estate\nDepreciation expense on invested real estate was $\n69.5\n million, $\n69.9\n million and $\n66.1\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

We have the right but do not sell or repledge collateral received in reverse repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements are structured as secured borrowings for all counterparties. We pledge fixed maturities available-for-sale, which the counterparties have the right to sell or repledge. Interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as part of operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Net proceeds related to repurchase agreements are reported as a component of financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Derivative Financial Instruments\nDerivatives are generally used to hedge or reduce exposure to market risks associated with assets held or expected to be purchased or sold and liabilities incurred or expected to be incurred. Derivatives are used to change the characteristics of our asset/liability mix consistent with our risk management activities. Derivatives are also used in asset replication and income generation strategies. \nTypes of Derivative Instruments\nInterest Rate Contracts\nInterest rate risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Sources of interest rate risk include the difference between the maturity and interest rate changes of assets with the liabilities they support, timing differences between the pricing of liabilities and the purchase or procurement of assets and changing cash flow profiles from original projections due to prepayment options embedded within asset and liability contracts. We use various derivatives to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.\nInterest rate swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and/or floating rate interest amounts based upon designated market rates or rate indices and an agreed-upon notional principal amount. Generally, \nno\n cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and \nno\n principal payments are made by any party. Cash is paid or received based on the terms of the swap. We use interest rate swaps primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities and to mitigate the risks arising from timing mismatches between assets and liabilities (including duration mismatches). We use interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the value of assets we anticipate acquiring and other anticipated transactions and commitments. We use interest rate swaps to hedge against cash variability related to forecasted transactions. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against changes in the value of the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) MRB. The GMWB rider on our variable annuity products provides for guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits regardless of the actual performance of various equity and/or fixed income funds available with the product. Additionally, we utilize interest rate swaps to replicate the returns of floating rate assets.\nInterest rate options, including interest rate caps and interest rate floors, which can be combined to form interest rate collars, are contracts that entitle the purchaser to pay or receive the amounts, if any, by which a specified market rate exceeds a cap strike interest rate, or falls below a floor strike interest rate, respectively, at specified dates. We use interest rate options to manage prepayment risks in our assets and minimum guaranteed interest rates and lapse risks in our liabilities.\nA swaption is an option to enter into an interest rate swap at a future date. We have purchased swaptions to hedge interest rate exposure for certain assets and liabilities. Swaptions not only hedge against the downside risk, but also allow us to take advantage of any upside benefits. \nIn exchange-traded futures transactions, we agree to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the values of which are determined by the values of designated classes of securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. We enter into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commissions merchants who are members of a trading exchange. We use exchange-traded interest rate futures to hedge against changes in value of the GMWB MRB in addition to the economic exposure to certain fund closures in process.\nInterest rate forwards, including to be announced (“TBA”) forwards, bond forwards and treasury forwards, are contracts to take delivery of a fixed income security at a specified price at a future date. TBA forwards deliver government guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. Bond forwards and treasury forwards deliver corporate or municipal and U.S. Treasury bonds, respectively. At inception of the TBA and certain treasury forward contracts we do not intend to take physical delivery. We intend to take delivery of the bond forwards referencing corporate, municipal and certain treasury bonds. We have used TBA forwards to gain exposure to the investment risk and return of agency mortgage-backed security pools in order to reduce asset and liability duration mismatch. Treasury forwards are used to hedge against changes in the value of the GMWB MRB and to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities. Bond forwards are used to gain leverage through synthetic exposure during the forward period and fix the purchase price of a bond at a specified date in future.\n126\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n5. Derivative Financial Instruments – (continued)\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nForeign currency risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk arises from foreign currency-denominated funding agreements issued to nonqualified institutional investors in the international market, foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, and our international operations, including expected cash flows and potential acquisition and divestiture activity. We use various derivatives to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nCurrency swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, a series of principal and interest payments in one currency for that of another currency. Generally, the principal amount of each currency is exchanged at the beginning and termination of the currency swap by each party. The interest payments are primarily fixed-to-fixed rate; however, they may also be fixed-to-floating rate or floating-to-fixed rate. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty for payments made in the same currency at each due date. We use currency swaps to reduce market risks from changes in currency exchange rates with respect to investments or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that we either hold or intend to acquire or sell.\nCurrency forwards are contracts in which we agree with other parties to deliver or receive a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. Typically, the price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. We use currency forwards to reduce market risks from changes in currency exchange rates with respect to investments or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that we either hold or intend to acquire or sell. We use currency forwards to hedge certain foreign-denominated real estate funds in our domestic operations and net equity investments in foreign operations, including certain sponsored investment funds.\nEquity Contracts\nEquity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in common stock prices. We use various derivatives to manage our exposure to equity risk, which arises from products in which the return or interest we credit is tied to an external equity index as well as products subject to minimum contractual guarantees.\nWe purchase equity call spreads (“option collars”) to hedge the equity participation rates promised to contractholders in conjunction with our fixed deferred annuity and universal life products that credit interest based on changes in an external equity index. \nWe use equity put options to hedge against changes in the value of the GMWB MRB related to the GMWB rider on our variable annuity products. We also use equity options to hedge returns credited to policyholder accounts related to our RILA products. The premium associated with certain options is paid quarterly over the life of the option contract. \nWe use exchange-traded equity futures to hedge against changes in the value of the GMWB MRB and returns credited to policyholder accounts related to our RILA products. We have used equity futures to hedge the economic exposure to certain fund closures in process.\nWe use equity total return swaps to hedge for income enhancement. Total return swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to periodically exchange the total return on a referenced security for an agreed-upon reference rate or spread based on specified notional amounts. \nCredit Contracts\nCredit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest. We use credit default swaps to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by providing comparable exposure to fixed income securities that might not be available in the primary market. They are also used to hedge credit exposures in our investment portfolio. Credit derivatives are used to sell or buy credit protection on an identified name or names on an unfunded or synthetic basis in return for receiving or paying a quarterly premium. The premium generally corresponds to a referenced name’s credit spread at the time the agreement is executed.\n127\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n5. Derivative Financial Instruments – (continued)\nWe also use credit total return swaps for income enhancement. In the case of a predefined credit event, total return swaps require the total return receiver to pay for the decline in the price of the referenced security.\nIn cases where we sell protection, we also buy a quality cash bond to match against the swap, thereby entering into a synthetic transaction replicating a cash security. When selling protection, if there is an event of default by the referenced name, as defined by the agreement, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security in a principal amount equal to the notional value of the swap.\nOther Contracts\nEmbedded Derivatives. \nWe purchase or issue certain financial instruments or products that contain a derivative instrument that is embedded in the financial instrument or product. When it is determined that the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly or closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host instrument for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the consolidated statements of financial position, is carried at fair value.\nWe offer group annuity contracts that have guaranteed separate accounts as an investment option. We have fixed deferred annuities, RILAs and universal life products that credit interest based on changes in an external equity index. \nWe have a funds withheld payable associated with coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements. The funds withheld payable has an embedded total return swap as the total return of the funds withheld assets are transferred to the reinsurer, which is not based on our own creditworthiness.\nExposure\nOur risk of loss is typically limited to the fair value of our derivative instruments and not to the notional or contractual amounts of these derivatives. We are also exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance of the counterparties. Our current credit exposure is limited to the value of derivatives that have become favorable to us. This credit risk is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with high credit ratings and by establishing and monitoring exposure limits. We also utilize various credit enhancements, including collateral and credit triggers to reduce the credit exposure to our derivative instruments.\nDerivatives may be exchange-traded or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives. Certain of our OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties (“OTC cleared”), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties (“bilateral OTC”). Our derivative transactions are generally documented under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off and close-out netting of exposures to specific counterparties. Under such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a transaction, we are permitted to set off our receivable from a counterparty against our payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. For reporting purposes, we do not offset fair value amounts of bilateral OTC derivatives for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparties under master netting agreements. OTC cleared derivatives have variation margin that is legally characterized as settlement of the derivative exposure, which reduces their fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nWe posted $\n533.7\n million and $\n544.2\n million in cash and securities under collateral arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, to satisfy collateral and initial margin requirements associated with our derivative credit support agreements and FCM agreements. \n128\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n5. Derivative Financial Instruments – (continued)\nCertain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade rating from each of the major credit rating agencies on our debt. If the ratings on our debt were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of these provisions and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value, inclusive of accrued interest, of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position without regard to netting under derivative credit support annex agreements as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was $\n472.3\n million and $\n482.3\n million, respectively. Cleared derivatives have contingent features that require us to post excess margin as required by the FCM. The terms surrounding excess margin vary by FCM agreement. With respect to derivatives containing collateral provisions, we posted collateral and initial margin of $\n533.7\n million and $\n544.2\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in the normal course of business, which reflects netting under derivative agreements. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered on December 31, 2024, we would be required to post up to an additional $\n95.7\n million of collateral to our counterparties. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had received $\n358.9\n million and $\n103.3\n million, respectively, of cash collateral associated with our derivative credit support annex agreements and FCM agreements, for which we recorded a corresponding liability reflecting our obligation to return the collateral. \nNotional amounts are used to express the extent of our involvement in derivative transactions and represent a standard measurement of the volume of our derivative activity.

Our credit derivative contracts sold reference a single name or reference security (referred to as “single name credit default swaps” or “single name total return swaps”). These instruments are either referenced in an OTC credit derivative transaction or embedded within an investment structure that has been fully consolidated into our financial statements.\nThese credit derivative transactions are subject to events of default defined within the terms of the contract, which normally consist of bankruptcy, failure to pay, or modified restructuring of the reference entity and/or issue. If a default event occurs for a reference name or security, we are obligated to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the notional amount of the credit derivative transaction. As a result, our maximum future payment is equal to the notional amount of the credit derivative. In certain cases, we also may have purchased credit protection with identical underlyings to certain of our sold protection transactions. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not purchase credit protection relating to our sold protection transactions. In certain circumstances, our potential loss could also be reduced by any amount recovered in the default proceedings of the underlying credit name. \n​\n130\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Financial Group, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)\nDecember 31, 2024\n5.

Derivative Financial Instruments – (continued)\nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges\nFair Value Hedges\nWe use fixed-to-floating rate interest rate swaps to more closely align the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and also use them to align the interest rate characteristics of certain liabilities. In general, these swaps are used in asset and liability management to modify duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes.\nWe enter into currency exchange swap agreements to convert certain foreign denominated assets into U.S. dollar denominated instruments to hedge the exposure to future currency volatility on those items.\nThe net interest effect of interest rate swap and currency swap transactions for derivatives in fair value hedges is recorded as an adjustment to income or expense of the underlying hedged item in our consolidated statements of operations.
