    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of various risks and uncertainties that may impact the Companies.\n \n\n\nMARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n \n\n\nThe Companies’ financial instruments, commodity contracts and related financial derivative instruments are exposed to potential losses due to adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity security prices as described below. Commodity price risk is present in the Companies’ electric operations and Dominion Energy’s natural gas procurement and marketing operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for electricity, natural gas and other commodities. The Companies use commodity derivative contracts to manage price risk exposures for these operations. Interest rate risk is generally related to their outstanding debt and future issuances of debt. In addition, the Companies are exposed to investment price risk through various portfolios of equity and debt securities. The Companies’ exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is related to certain fixed price contracts associated with the CVOW Commercial Project which it manages through foreign currency exchange rate derivatives. The contracts include services denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for approximately €2.6 billion and 5.1 billion kr. In addition, certain of the fixed price contracts, approximately €0.7 billion, contain commodity indexing provisions linked to steel.\n \n\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive instruments over a selected time period due to a 10% change in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.\n \n\n\nCommodity Price Risk\n \n\n\nTo manage price risk, the Companies hold commodity-based derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes associated with purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products.\n \n\n\nThe derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are executed within established policies and procedures and may include instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, options and FTRs that are sensitive to changes in the related commodity prices. For sensitivity analysis purposes, the hypothetical change in market prices of commodity-based derivative instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future periods, the volatility of the market prices in each period, as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments. Prices and volatility are principally determined based on observable market prices.\n \n\n\nA hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of $18 million and $62 million in the fair value of Dominion Energy’s commodity-based derivative instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nA hypothetical 10% decrease in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of $15 million in the fair value of Virginia Power’s commodity-based derivative instruments as of December 31, 2024. A hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of $24 million in the fair value of Virginia Power’s commodity-based derivative instruments  as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\nThe impact of a change in energy commodity prices on the Companies’ commodity-based derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from commodity-based financial derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction, such as revenue from physical sales of the commodity.\n \n\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n \n\n\nThe Companies manage their interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. For variable rate debt outstanding for Dominion Energy, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would result in a $12 million and $56 million decrease in earnings at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For variable rate debt outstanding for Virginia Power, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would result in a $7 million and $5 million decrease in earnings at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nThe Companies also use interest rate derivatives, including forward-starting swaps, interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements to manage interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had $10.8 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of these interest rate derivatives outstanding in combined absolute value of their long and short positions, except\n \n\n\n \n83\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nin the case of offsetting transactions, for which they represent the absolute value of the net volume of their long and short positions. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $157 million and $155 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had $16.3 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of these interest rate derivatives outstanding in combined absolute value of their long and short positions, except in the case of offsetting transactions, for which they represent the absolute value of the net volume of their long and short positions. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $120 million and $151 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2023.\n \n\n\nThe impact of a change in interest rates on the Companies’ interest rate-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from interest rate derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction.\n \n\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n \n\n\nThe Companies utilize foreign currency exchange rate swaps to economically hedge the foreign currency exchange risk associated with fixed price contracts related to the CVOW Commercial Project denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Dominion Energy had €1.1 billion and €2.1 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these foreign currency forward purchase agreements outstanding. A hypothetical 10% increase in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease of $106 million and $202 million in the fair value of Dominion Energy’s foreign currency swaps at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nThe impact of a change in exchange rates on the Companies’ foreign currency-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from foreign exchange derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction.\n \n\n\nInvestment Price Risk\n \n\n\nThe Companies are subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust funds that are managed by third-party investment managers. These trust funds primarily hold marketable securities that are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy recognized net investment gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $1.1 billion and $879 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Dominion Energy recorded, in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized (losses) gains on debt investments of $(28) million and $117 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nVirginia Power recognized net investment gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $580 million and $448 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Virginia Power recorded, in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized (losses) gains on debt investments of $(10) million and $66 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\nDominion Energy sponsors pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Virginia Power employees participate in these plans. Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement plan assets experienced aggregate actual returns of $738 million and $1.2 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively, compared to expected returns of $982 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are immediately recognized in earnings annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year as well as whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement. A hypothetical 0.25% decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have had a $31 million impact in both 2024 and 2023 to the expected returns on plan assets.\n\n\n \n84\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRisk Management Policies\n \n\n\nThe Companies have established operating procedures with corporate management to ensure that proper internal controls are maintained. In addition, Dominion Energy has established an independent function at the corporate level to monitor compliance with the credit and commodity risk management policies of all subsidiaries, including Virginia Power. Dominion Energy maintains credit policies that include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty’s financial condition, collateral requirements where deemed necessary and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. In addition, Dominion Energy also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis. Based on these credit policies and the Companies’ December 31, 2024 provision for credit losses, management believes that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on the Companies’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance.\n \n\n\n \n85\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dominion Energy at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), Dominion Energy’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on Dominion Energy’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nChange in Accounting Principle\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Dominion Energy has elected to change its method of accounting for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses on its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans into earnings from an amortization approach to immediate recognition, which has been retrospectively applied in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the three years ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Dominion Energy’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Dominion Energy’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Dominion Energy in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Consolidated Financial Statements — Refer to Notes 2, 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n \n\n\nDominion Energy, through its regulated electric and gas subsidiaries, is subject to rate regulation by certain state public utility commissions and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) (collectively, the “relevant commissions”) which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric utility companies. Management has determined its rate-regulated subsidiaries meet the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to apply the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant and equipment, net; regulatory assets; regulatory liabilities; operating revenues; electric fuel and other energy-related purchases; purchased gas; other operations and maintenance expense; depreciation and amortization expense; and impairment of assets and other charges, collectively, the “financial statement impacts of rate regulation.”\n\n\n \n87\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenue provided by Dominion Energy’s electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and its gas distribution operations is primarily based on rates approved by the relevant commissions. Further, Virginia Electric and Power Company’s (“Virginia Power”) retail base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “Virginia Commission”) in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Power’s actual earned return on equity (“ROE”) during a historic test period, and determination of Virginia Power’s authorized ROE prospectively. Under certain circumstances, Virginia Power may be required to credit a portion of its earnings to customers.\n\n\nWhen it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds or other benefits through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. In addition, a loss is recognized if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Dominion Energy evaluates whether recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable as well as whether a regulatory liability due to customers is probable and makes various assumptions in its analyses. These analyses are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation and judicial actions; past experience; discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel; estimated construction costs; forecasted earnings; and considerations around the likelihood of impacts from events such as unusual weather conditions, extreme weather events and other natural disasters, and unplanned outages of facilities.\n\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about the financial statement impacts of rate regulation. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates and (2) whether a regulatory liability is due to customers.  Given management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the relevant commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of the accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n \n\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n \n\n\nOur audit procedures related to the assessment of whether recovery of regulatory assets through future rates or a regulatory liability due to customers is probable included the following, among others:\n\n\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) recovery of regulatory assets through future rates, and (2) whether a regulatory liability is due to customers. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory and legislative developments that may impact the assessment of whether recovery of regulatory assets through future rates or a regulatory liability due to customers is probable.\n\n\n•\nWe evaluated Dominion Energy’s disclosures related to the financial statement impacts of rate regulation.\n\n\n•\nWe read and evaluated orders issued by the relevant commissions, as well as relevant regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, existing laws and other publicly available information to assess whether this external information was properly considered by management in concluding upon the financial statement impacts of rate regulation.\n\n\n•\nWe considered the likelihood of (1) recovery of regulatory assets through future rates and (2) whether a regulatory liability is due to customers based on precedents established by the relevant commissions’ previous orders and Dominion Energy’s past experience with the relevant commissions. \n\n\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected associated documents and testimony filed with the relevant commissions for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions. \n\n\n•\nWe read and analyzed the minutes of the Boards of Directors of Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy’s rate-regulated subsidiaries for discussions of changes in legal, regulatory, or business factors which could impact management’s conclusions with respect to the financial statement impacts of rate regulation.\n\n\nCoastal Virginia Offshore Wind (“CVOW”) Commercial Project – Estimated Total Project Cost – Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n \n\n\nAs discussed in Note 10, Virginia Power’s CVOW Commercial Project is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2026 with an estimated total project cost of approximately $10.7 billion, excluding financing costs.  The expected total project cost reflects increases driven primarily by projections for onshore electrical interconnection costs and network upgrade costs assigned by PJM.\n \n\n\n \n88\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRelative to Virginia Power’s previous cost estimate, the updated estimated total project cost reflects an approximately $0.6 billion increase for such onshore costs and network upgrade costs assigned to the project by PJM and an approximately $0.3 billion increase for increased contingency for remaining construction activities and other factors.\n \n\n\nVirginia Power is subject to a cost sharing mechanism in which Virginia Power will be eligible to recover 50% of such incremental costs which fall between $10.3 billion and $11.3 billion with no recovery of such incremental costs which fall between $11.3 billion and $13.7 billion. There is no cost sharing mechanism for any total construction costs in excess of $13.7 billion, the recovery of which would be determined in a future Virginia Commission proceeding. In October 2024, Virginia Power closed on the sale of a 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak Partners, LLC (Stonepeak) pursuant to which Stonepeak will contribute 50% of the remaining capital necessary to fund construction of the CVOW Commercial Project provided the total project cost, excluding financing costs, is less than $11.3 billion.\n \n\n\nAs a result of the revised total project cost estimate and cost sharing mechanism, in the fourth quarter of 2024 Virginia Power recorded a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers of $206 million within impairment of assets and other charges, which includes $103 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, and an associated income tax benefit of $26 million, in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\n \n\n\nWe identified the auditing of management’s anticipated allocated network upgrade costs and project contingency cost components of the revised total project cost estimate as a critical audit matter because of the judgments management made to determine those components of the expected total project cost. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity, and a significant extent of effort, including the need to involve our construction specialists.\n\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n \n\n\nOur audit procedures related to the reasonableness of the anticipated allocated network upgrade costs and total project contingency components included the following, among others:\n\n\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over management’s calculation of estimated total project costs, including those over the determination of anticipated allocated network upgrade costs and the estimate of total project contingency.\n\n\n•\nWe evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast contingency by performing a retrospective review of the project’s historical contingency utilization, reviewing internal communications relevant to the project, reading public information included in press releases and regulatory filings.\n\n\n•\nWith the assistance of our construction specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) contingency methodology (2) percentage complete of certain significant project components and (3) overall contingency percentage.\n\n\n•\nWe obtained an understanding of management’s cost model for the network upgrade costs. We audited key inputs to the model and associated allocated cost estimate as it relates to the network upgrade costs, including generator participation and other expected transmission projects. We selected a sample of project costs associated with the network upgrade cost and compared our selections to realized costs of comparable historical projects.  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n /s/\n Deloitte &

and Shareholder of Virginia Electric and Power Company\n\n\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Virginia Electric and Power Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy, Inc.) and subsidiaries (\"Virginia Power\") at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Virginia Power at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Virginia Power’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Virginia Power’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Virginia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Virginia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Virginia Power’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Consolidated Financial Statements — Refer to Notes 2, 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\n\nVirginia \nPower is subject to utility rate regulation by certain state public utility commissions and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) (collectively, the “relevant commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric utility companies in the territories Virginia Power serves. Management has determined Virginia Power meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to apply the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures such as property, plant, and equipment, net; regulatory assets; regulatory liabilities; operating revenues; electric fuel and other energy-related purchases; other operations and maintenance expense; depreciation and amortization expense; and impairment of assets and other charges (benefits), collectively, the “financial statement impacts of rate\n regulation”.\n\n\nRevenue \nprovided by Virginia Power’s electric transmission, distribution and generation operations is primarily based on rates approved by the relevant commissions. Further, Virginia Power’s retail base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “Virginia Commission”) in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Power’s actual earned return on equity (“ROE”) during a historic test period\n \n\n\n \n96\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nand determination of Virginia Power’s authorized ROE prospectively. Under certain circumstances, Virginia Power may be required to credit a portion of its earnings to\n customers.\n \n\n\nWhen \nit is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds or other benefits through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. In addition, a loss is recognized if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Virginia Power evaluates whether recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable as well as whether a regulatory liability due to customers is probable and makes various assumptions in its analyses. These analyses are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation and judicial actions; past experience; discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel; estimated construction costs; forecasted earnings; and considerations around the likelihood of impacts from events such as unusual weather conditions, extreme weather events, and other natural disasters, and unplanned outages of \nfacilities.\n \n\n\nWe \nidentified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about the financial statement impacts of rate regulation. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates and (2) whether a regulatory liability is due to customers. Given management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the relevant commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of the accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent\n complexities.\n \n\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\n\nOur \naudit procedures related to the assessment of whether recovery of regulatory assets through future rates or a regulatory liability due to customers is probable included the following, among\n others:\n\n\n•\nWe \ntested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) recovery of regulatory assets through future rates, and (2) whether a regulatory liability is due to customers. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory and legislative developments that may impact the assessment of whether recovery of regulatory assets through future rates or a regulatory liability due to customers is \nprobable.\n\n\n•\nWe evaluated Virginia Power’s disclosures related to the financial statement impacts of rate regulation.\n\n\n•\nWe \nread and evaluated orders issued by the relevant commissions, as well as relevant regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, existing laws and other publicly available information to assess whether this external information was properly considered by management in concluding upon the financial statement impacts of rate\n regulation.\n\n\n•\nWe \nconsidered the likelihood of (1) recovery of regulatory assets through future rates and (2) whether a regulatory liability is due to customers based on precedents established by the relevant commissions’ previous orders and Virginia Power’s past experience with relevant \ncommissions. \n\n\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected associated documents and testimony filed with the relevant commissions for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.\n\n\n•\nWe \nread and analyzed the minutes of the Board of Directors of Dominion Energy, Inc. and the Board of Directors of Virginia Power, for discussions of changes in legal, regulatory, or business factors which could impact management’s conclusions with respect to the financial statement impacts of rate \nregulation.\n\n\nCoastal Virginia Offshore Wind (“CVOW”) Commercial Project – Estimated Total Project Cost – Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n \n\n\nAs discussed in Note 10, Virginia Power’s CVOW Commercial Project is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2026 with an estimated total project cost of approximately $10.7 billion, excluding financing costs.  The expected total project cost reflects increases driven primarily by projections for onshore electrical interconnection costs and network upgrade costs assigned by PJM.  Relative to Virginia Power’s previous cost estimate, the updated estimated total project cost reflects an approximately $0.6 billion increase for such onshore costs and network upgrade costs assigned to the project by PJM and an approximately $0.3 billion increase for increased contingency for remaining construction activities and other factors.\n \n\n\nVirginia Power is subject to a cost sharing mechanism in which Virginia Power will be eligible to recover 50% of such incremental costs which fall between $10.3 billion and $11.3 billion with no recovery of such incremental costs which fall between $11.3 billion\n \n\n\n \n97\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nand $13.7 billion. There is no cost sharing mechanism for any total construction costs in excess of $13.7 billion, the recovery of which would be determined in a future Virginia Commission proceeding. In October 2024, Virginia Power closed on the sale of a 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak Partners, LLC (Stonepeak) pursuant to which Stonepeak will contribute 50% of the remaining capital necessary to fund construction of the CVOW Commercial Project provided the total project cost, excluding financing costs, is less than $11.3 billion.\n \n\n\nAs a result of the revised total project cost estimate and cost sharing mechanism, in the fourth quarter of 2024 Virginia Power recorded a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers of $206 million within impairment of assets and other charges, which includes $103 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, and an associated income tax benefit of $26 million, in Virginia Power’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\n \n\n\nWe identified the auditing of management’s anticipated allocated network upgrade costs and project contingency cost components of the revised total project cost estimate as a critical audit matter because of the judgments management made to determine those components of the expected total project cost. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity, and a significant extent of effort, including the need to involve our construction specialists.\n\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n \n\n\nOur audit procedures related to the reasonableness of the anticipated allocated network upgrade costs and total project contingency components included the following, among others:\n\n\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over management’s calculation of estimated total project costs, including those over the determination of anticipated allocated network upgrade costs and the estimate of total project contingency.\n\n\n•\nWe evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast contingency by performing a retrospective review of the project’s historical contingency utilization, reviewing internal communications relevant to the project, reading public information included in press releases and regulatory filings.\n\n\n•\nWith the assistance of our construction specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) contingency methodology (2) percentage complete of certain significant project components and (3) overall contingency percentage.\n\n\n•\nWe obtained an understanding of management’s cost model for the network upgrade costs. We audited key inputs to the model and associated allocated cost estimate as it relates to the network upgrade costs, including generator participation and other expected transmission projects. We selected a sample of project costs associated with the network upgrade cost and compared our selections to realized costs of comparable historical projects.  \n\n\n \n\n\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche

NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nDominion Energy, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is one of the nation’s leading developers and operators of regulated offshore wind and solar power and the largest producer of carbon-free electricity in New England, and serves primarily electric utility customers in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina through its subsidiaries, Virginia Power and DESC. Dominion Energy also has nonregulated operations that consist primarily of long-term contracted electric generation operations.\n \nIn connection with the comprehensive business review concluded in March 2024, Dominion Energy sold all of its regulated gas distribution operations, except for DESC’s, to Enbridge through the East Ohio Transaction (completed in March 2024), the Questar Gas Transaction (completed in May 2024) and the PSNC Transaction (completed in September 2024). In addition in September 2023, Dominion Energy completed the sale of its remaining \n50\n% noncontrolling partnership interest in Cove Point to BHE. As discussed in Notes 3 and 9, these operations as well as certain solar generation facility development operations are reflected as discontinued operations in Dominion Energy's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \nDominion Energy manages its daily operations through three primary operating segments: Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and Contracted Energy.  Dominion Energy also reports a Corporate and Other segment, which includes its corporate, service company and other functions (including unallocated debt) as well as its noncontrolling interest in Dominion Privatization, its noncontrolling interest in Wrangler (through March 2022) and Hope (through August 2022). In addition, Corporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominion Energy’s operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the operating segments’ performance or in allocating resources including the net impact of the operations reflected as discontinued operations, which in addition to the operations discussed above includes Dominion Energy’s noncontrolling interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. See Notes 3 and 9 for additional information.\n \nVirginia Power is a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and North Carolina. Virginia Power is a member of PJM, an RTO, and its electric transmission facilities are integrated into the PJM wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Power’s stock is owned by Dominion Energy.\nVirginia Power manages its daily operations through \none\n primary operating segment: Dominion Energy Virginia. It also reports a Corporate and Other segment that primarily includes specific items attributable to its operating segment that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segment’s performance or in allocating resources.\n \nSee Note 26 for further discussion of the Companies’ operating segments.\n \n\n\nNOTE \n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \nGeneral\n \nThe Companies make certain estimates and assumptions in preparing their Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses and cash flows for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n \nThe Companies’ Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, their accounts, those of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries and non-wholly-owned entities in which they have a controlling financial interest. For certain partnership structures, income is allocated based on the liquidation value of the underlying contractual arrangements. Stonepeak’s \n50\n% ownership interest in OSWP is reflected as noncontrolling interest in the Companies’ Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Companies report certain contracts, instruments and investments at fair value. See below and Note \n6 for further information on fair value measurements.\n \nThe Companies consider acquisitions or dispositions in which substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated into a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets to be an acquisition or a disposition of an asset, rather than a business. See Notes 3 and 10 for further information on such transactions.\nDominion Energy maintains pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Virginia Power participates in certain of these plans. See Note 22\n for further information on these plans.\n \nCertain amounts in the Companies’ 2023 and 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2024 presentation for comparative purposes; however, such reclassifications did not affect the Companies’ net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash flows. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy changed its method of accounting for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses on its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans into earnings from an\n \n\n\n \n105\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\namortization approach to immediate recognition. All prior period information was conformed to this presentation as described below under the heading \nChange in Accounting Policy\n.\n \nAmounts disclosed for Dominion Energy are inclusive of Virginia Power, where applicable.\nChange in Accounting Policy\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy changed its method of accounting for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses on its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans into earnings from an amortization approach to immediate recognition. Previously, Dominion Energy recognized the net actuarial gains and losses as a component of AOCI and amortized such amounts into earnings to the extent such gains and losses were outside a corridor of the greater of 10% of the market-related value of plan assets or 10% of the plans' projected benefit obligation. As a result of the change in policy, Dominion Energy immediately recognizes the change in the fair value of plan assets and liabilities and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year as well as whenever a triggering event occurs that is determined to require remeasurement. This change in accounting policy does not impact the recognition of the other components of net periodic benefit cost associated with Dominion Energy’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Actuarial losses attributable to Dominion Energy’s rate regulated operations are deferred to regulatory assets when it is probable that regulators will permit them to be recovered from customers in future rates. Likewise, actuarial gains attributable to Dominion Energy’s rate regulated operations are deferred to regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds or other benefits through future rates. Although the amortization of actuarial gains and losses is considered acceptable, Dominion Energy believes the immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses to earnings. Dominion Energy applied this change in accounting policy retrospectively to all prior periods presented.\n \nThe following table details the increase (decrease) to each affected line item in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the periods presented:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions, except per share amounts)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Benefit Plan Market-Related Impacts\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income (expense)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n359\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n226\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n93\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n57\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income from continuing operations\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n266\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n169\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnings per share\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.32\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.17\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nExcludes the impacts associated with the impairment of goodwill associated with the Questar Transaction previously recorded in 2023 and gain on sale of Hope in 2022. Such amounts are an $\n18\n million and $\n38\n million increase in net income from discontinued operations with a corresponding $\n0.02\n and $\n0.04\n increase in earnings per share, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a  $\n14\n decrease in loss on sales of assets, a $\n3\n million increase in income tax expense and an $\n11\n million increase in net income from continuing operations, resulting in a $\n0.01\n increase in earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. Such amounts include the impact on deferred income taxes of $\n10\n million in 2023 related to an increase in the deferred taxes on the outside basis of Questar Gas, Wexpro and related affiliates’ stock, which reversed in 2024 upon closing of the Questar Gas Transaction. The impact to Dominion Energy's net income (loss) from discontinued operations includes an increase (decrease) of $\n4\n million ($\n—\n per share), $\n16\n million ($\n0.02\n per share), $(\n2\n) million ($\n—\n per share) and $\n—\n million ($\n—\n per share) for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2024, respectively. \n(2)\nThe impact to Dominion Energy's net income from continuing operations includes an increase (decrease) of $(\n237\n) million ($(\n0.28\n) per share), $(\n8\n) million ($(\n0.01\n) per share), $\n6\n million ($\n0.01\n per share) and $(\n27\n) million ($(\n0.03\n) per share) for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2024, respectively. \nThe employee benefit plan market-related impacts on Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended 2024, 2023 and 2022 was an increase (decrease) to changes in net unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit costs (credits) of $\n278\n million (net of tax of $(\n98\n) million), $(\n27\n) million (net of tax of $\n9\n million) and $\n218\n million (net of tax of $(\n75\n) million), respectively, and an increase (decrease) to amounts reclassified to net income (loss) related to net pension and other postretirement benefits costs (credits) of $(\n68\n) million (net of tax of $\n24\n million), $\n28\n million (net of tax of $(\n15\n) million) and $(\n88\n) million (net of tax of $\n32\n million), respectively.\n \nThe employee benefit plan market-related impacts on Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was a reclassification between AOCI and retained earnings. In addition, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 had an increase of $\n48\n million \nin assets held for sale related to a decreased impairment of goodwill associated\n \n\n\n \n106\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwith \nthe Questar Gas Transaction. Dominion Energy recorded a cumulative decrease of $\n1.2\n billion to retained earnings as of January 1, 2022.\n \nOperating Revenue\n \nOperating revenue is recorded on the basis of services rendered, commodities delivered or contracts settled and includes amounts yet to be billed to customers. The Companies collect sales, consumption and consumer utility taxes; however, these amounts are excluded from revenue. Dominion Energy’s customer receivables at December 31, 2024 and 2023\n included $\n797\n million and $\n1.0\n billion, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of electricity and natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its utility customers. The balances presented within assets held for sale were $\n284\n million at December 31, \n2023. Virginia Power’s customer receivables at December 31, 2024 and 2023\n included $\n611\n million and $\n550\n million, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of electricity delivered but not yet billed to its customers. See Note \n25 for amounts attributable to related parties.\nThe primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Dominion Energy are as follows:\n \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n•\nRegulated electric sales\n consist primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales, and federally-regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services; \n•\nNonregulated electric sales\n consist primarily of sales of electricity at market-based rates and contracted fixed rates and associated hedging activity as well as sales to Virginia Power customers from non-jurisdictional solar generation facilities; \n•\nRegulated gas sales\n consist primarily of state-regulated natural gas sales and related distribution services; \n•\nRegulated gas transportation and storage sales \nconsist of state-regulated sales of gathering services (through August 2022) and sales of transportation services to off-system customers;\n•\nOther regulated revenue\n consists primarily of miscellaneous service revenue from electric and gas distribution operations and sales of excess electric capacity and other commodities; and\n•\nOther nonregulated revenue\n consists primarily of sales of other miscellaneous products. Other nonregulated revenue also includes service concession arrangements (through December 2022) and revenue associated with services provided to entities presented in discontinued operations under transition services agreements.\nOther Revenue\n•\nOther revenue \nconsists primarily of alternative revenue programs, gains and losses from derivative instruments not subject to hedge accounting and lease revenues.\nThe primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Virginia Power are as follows:\n \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n•\nRegulated electric sales\n consist primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales and federally-regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services;\n•\nNonregulated electric sales \nconsists of sales to customers from non-jurisdictional solar generation facilities;\n•\nOther regulated revenue \nconsists primarily of sales of excess capacity and other commodities and miscellaneous service revenue from electric distribution operations; and\n•\nOther nonregulated revenue \nconsists primarily of revenue from renting space on certain electric transmission poles and distribution towers and service concession arrangements (through October 2022).\nOther Revenue\n•\nOther revenue\n consists primarily of alternative revenue programs, gains and losses from derivative instruments not subject to hedge accounting and lease revenues. \nThe Companies record refunds to customers as required by state commissions as a reduction to regulated electric sales or regulated gas sales, as applicable. The Companies’ revenue accounted for under the alternative revenue program guidance primarily consists of the equity return for under-recovery of certain riders. Alternative revenue programs compensate the Companies for certain projects and\n \n\n\n \n107\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ninitiatives. Revenues arising from these programs are presented separately from revenue arising from contracts with customers in the categories above.\n \nRevenues from electric and gas sales are recognized over time, as the customers of the Companies consume gas and electricity as it is delivered. Fixed fees are recognized ratably over the life of the contract as the stand-ready performance obligation is satisfied, while variable usage fees are recognized when Dominion Energy has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance obligation completed to date. Sales of products and services typically transfer control and are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product or service. The customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product at the time the product is delivered. The contract with the customer states the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product or service purchased. Payment for most sales and services varies by contract type but is typically due within a month of billing.\n \nRevenue included in Discontinued Operations\nOperating revenue for the gas distribution operations sold to Enbridge as part of the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions primarily consists of state-regulated natural gas sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers and related distribution services, state regulated gas distribution charges to retail distribution service customers opting for alternate suppliers and sales of commodities related to nonregulated extraction activities.\n \nTransportation and storage contracts associated with the operations sold to Enbridge as part of the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions are primarily stand-ready service contracts that include fixed reservation and variable usage fees. Substantially all of the revenue associated with these local gas distribution companies is derived from performance obligations satisfied over time and month-to-month billings according to their respective tariffs.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss if counterparties fail to perform their contractual obligations. In order to minimize overall credit risk, credit policies are maintained, including the evaluation of counterparty financial condition, collateral requirements and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. In addition, counterparties may make available collateral, including letters of credit or cash held as margin deposits, as a result of exceeding agreed-upon credit limits, or may be required to prepay the transaction.\n \nThe Companies maintain a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of their customers, historical trends and other information. Expected credit losses are estimated and recorded based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of financial assets held at amortized cost as well as expected credit losses on commitments with respect to financial guarantees.\n \nElectric Fuel, Purchased Energy and Purchased Gas-Deferred Costs\nWhere permitted by regulatory authorities, the differences between the Companies’ actual electric fuel and purchased energy expenses and Dominion Energy’s purchased gas expenses and the related levels of recovery for these expenses in current rates are deferred and matched against recoveries in future periods. The deferral of costs in excess of current period fuel rate recovery is recognized as a regulatory asset, while rate recovery in excess of current period fuel expenses is recognized as a regulatory liability.\n \nOf the cost of fuel used in electric generation and energy purchases to serve Virginia utility customers, at December 31, 2024\n, approximately \n87\n% is subject to Virginia Power’s deferred fuel accounting, while substantially all of the remaining amount is subject to recovery through similar mechanisms. Additionally in 2024, Virginia Power securitized $\n1.3\n billion of under-recovered deferred fuel expenses through the issuance of bonds by VPFS. Of the cost of fuel used in electric generation and energy purchases to serve South Carolina utility customers, at December 31, \n2024, substantially all is subject to DESC’s deferred fuel accounting.\nVirtually all of DESC’s natural gas purchases are either subject to deferral accounting or are recovered from the customer in the same accounting period as the sale. Through the respective closing dates of the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions, these companies’ natural gas purchases were also either subject to deferral accounting or were recovered from the customer in the same accounting period as the sale.\n \nDominion Energy earned certain cost saving sharing incentives under the Wexpro Agreements to the extent that the cost of gas supplied to Questar Gas was a certain amount lower than third-party market rates. In 2023\n and 2022, Dominion Energy recorded $\n4\n million and $\n27\n million, respectively, for such incentives, reflected in discontinued operations in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income, with \nno\n such incentives recorded in 2024.\n\n\n \n108\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome Taxes\nA consolidated federal income tax return is filed for Dominion Energy and its subsidiaries, including Virginia Power. In addition, where applicable, combined income tax returns for Dominion Energy and its subsidiaries are filed in various states; otherwise, separate state income tax returns are filed.\nVirginia Power participates in intercompany tax sharing agreements with Dominion Energy and its subsidiaries. Current income taxes are based on taxable income or loss and credits determined on a separate company basis.\nUnder the agreements, if a subsidiary incurs a tax loss or earns a credit, recognition of current income tax benefits is limited to refunds of prior year taxes obtained by the carryback of the net operating loss or credit or to the extent the tax loss or credit is absorbed by the taxable income of other Dominion Energy consolidated group members. Otherwise, the net operating loss or credit is carried forward and is recognized as a deferred tax asset until realized.\nAccounting for income taxes involves an asset and liability approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided, representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Accordingly, deferred taxes are recognized for the future consequences of different treatments used for the reporting of transactions in financial accounting and income tax returns. The Companies establish a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Where the treatment of temporary differences is different for rate regulated operations, a regulatory asset is recognized if it is probable that future revenues will be provided for the payment of deferred tax liabilities.\nThe Companies recognize positions taken, or expected to be taken, in income tax returns that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nIf it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax position, or some portion thereof, will be sustained, the related tax benefits are not recognized in the financial statements. Unrecognized tax benefits may result in an increase in income taxes payable, a reduction of income tax refunds receivable or changes in deferred taxes. Also, when uncertainty about the deductibility of an amount is limited to the timing of such deductibility, the increase in income taxes payable (or reduction in tax refunds receivable) is accompanied by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities. Except when such amounts are presented net with amounts receivable from or amounts prepaid to tax authorities, noncurrent income taxes payable related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified in other deferred credits and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and current payables are included in accrued interest, payroll, and taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Companies recognize interest on underpayments and overpayments of income taxes in interest expense and other income, respectively. Penalties are also recognized in other income.\nAt December 31, 2024, Virginia Power had an income tax-related affiliated receivable of $\n26\n million, comprised of $\n21\n million of federal income taxes and $\n5\n million of state income taxes receivable from Dominion Energy. Virginia Power’s net affiliated balances are expected to be received from Dominion Energy in 2025.\nAt December 31, 2023, Virginia Power had an income tax-related affiliated receivable of $\n40\n million, comprised of $\n45\n million of federal income taxes receivable from, and $\n5\n million of state income taxes payable to, Dominion Energy. Virginia Power’s net affiliated balances were received from Dominion Energy in 2024.\nInvestment tax credits for both regulated and nonregulated operations are deferred and amortized to income tax expense over the service lives of the properties giving rise to the credits beginning in the year qualifying property is placed in service. The Companies recognize the tax benefit related to initial book and tax basis differences as a reduction of income tax expense in the year in which the qualifying property is placed into service, except where cost-of-service rate regulation applies. Production tax credits are recognized as energy is generated and sold. The IRA allows the election of either the investment tax credit or production tax credit for certain technologies including solar and wind. Such election is made on a project-by-project basis and the choice of credit may vary based on a combination of factors including, but not limited to, capital expenditures and net capacity factors.\n\n\n \n109\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash, Restricted Cash and Equivalents\nCash, restricted cash and equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and temporary investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nCurrent banking arrangements generally do not require checks to be funded until they are presented for payment. \nThe following table illustrates the checks outstanding but not yet presented for payment and recorded in accounts payable for the Companies:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December\n

Energy had $\n19\n million of checks outstanding but not yet presented for payment included in  liabilities held for sale.\n \n \nRestricted Cash and Equivalents\nThe Companies hold restricted cash and equivalent balances that primarily consist of amounts held for litigation settlements, customer deposits, federal assistance funds and future debt payments on DECP Holdings’ term loan agreement (through September 2023), on Eagle Solar’s senior note agreement (through February 2024) and on the securitization bonds.\n \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the total cash,

leases entered in 2022.\n \nDistributions from Equity Method Investees\nDominion Energy holds investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and classifies distributions from equity method investees as either cash flows from operating activities or cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows according to the nature of the distribution. Distributions received are classified on the basis of the nature of the activity of the investee that generated the distribution as either a return on investment (classified as cash flows from operating activities) or a return of an investment (classified as cash flows from investing activities) when such information is available to Dominion Energy.\n \nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. However, the use of a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between bid and ask prices) is permitted. Fair values are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in valuation techniques and the inputs to valuations. This includes not only the credit standing of counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements but also the impact of the Companies’ own nonperformance risk on their liabilities. Fair value measurements assume that the transaction occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability (the market with the most volume and activity for the asset or liability from the perspective of the reporting entity), or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability (the market in which the reporting entity would be able to maximize the amount received or minimize the amount paid). Dominion Energy applies fair value measurements to certain assets and liabilities including commodity, interest rate and/or foreign currency exchange rate derivative instruments and other investments including those held in nuclear decommissioning, rabbi and pension and other postretirement benefit plan trusts, in accordance with the requirements discussed above. Virginia Power applies fair value measurements to certain assets and liabilities including commodity, interest rate and/or foreign currency exchange rate derivative instruments and other investments including those held in the nuclear decommissioning trust, in accordance with the requirements discussed above. The Companies apply credit adjustments to their derivative fair values in accordance with the requirements described above.\n \nInputs and Assumptions\n \nFair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, price information is sought from external sources, including industry publications, and to a lesser extent, broker quotes. When evaluating pricing information provided by Designated Contract Market settlement pricing, other pricing services or brokers, the Companies consider the ability to transact at the quoted price, i.e. if the quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and to the extent which pricing models are used, if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if the Companies believe that observable pricing is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases the unobservable inputs are developed and substantiated using historical information, available market data, third-party data and statistical analysis. Periodically, inputs to valuation models are reviewed and revised as needed, based on historical information, updated market data, market liquidity and relationships and changes in third-party sources.\n\n\n \n111\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor options and contracts with option-like characteristics where observable pricing information is not available from external sources, the Companies generally use a model that considers time value, the volatility of the underlying commodities and other relevant assumptions when estimating fair value. For contracts with unique characteristics, the Companies may estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow approach deemed appropriate in the circumstances and applied consistently from period to period. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a significant effect on the contract’s estimated fair value.\nThe inputs and assumptions used in measuring fair value include the following:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDerivative Contracts\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputs and assumptions\n\n\n \n\n\nCommodity\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest Rate\n\n\n \n\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate\n\n\n \n\n\nInvestments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward commodity prices\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransaction prices\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice volatility\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice correlation\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolumes\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity location\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest rate curves\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign currency forward exchange rates\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuoted securities prices and indices\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurities trading information including volume and restrictions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaturity\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest rates\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit quality of counterparties and the Companies\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit enhancements\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotional value\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime value\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLevels\n \nThe Companies also utilize the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:\n \n•\nLevel 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that they have the ability to access at the measurement date. Instruments categorized in Level 1 primarily consist of financial instruments such as certain exchange-traded derivatives and exchange-listed equities, U.S. and international equity securities, mutual funds and certain treasury securities and cash and cash equivalents held in nuclear decommissioning trust funds for the Companies and benefit plan trust funds and rabbi trust funds for Dominion Energy. \n•\nLevel 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means. Instruments categorized in Level 2 primarily include commodity forwards and swaps, interest rate swaps, foreign currency exchange rate instruments and certain cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt instruments, government securities and other fixed income investments held in nuclear decommissioning trust funds for the Companies and benefit plan trust funds and rabbi trust funds for Dominion Energy. \n•\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Instruments categorized in Level 3 for the Companies consist of long-dated commodity derivatives, FTRs, certain natural gas options and other modeled commodity derivatives. \nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these cases, the lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. Alternative investments, consisting of investments in partnerships, joint ventures and other alternative investments held in nuclear decommissioning and benefit plan trust funds, are generally valued using NAV based on the proportionate share of the fair value as determined by reference to the most recent audited fair value financial statements or fair value statements provided by the investment manager adjusted for any significant events occurring between the investment manager’s and the Companies’ measurement date. Alternative investments recorded at NAV are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n \nTransfers \nout of Level 3 represent assets and liabilities that were previously classified as Level 3 for which the inputs became observable for classification in either Level 1 or Level 2. Because the activity and liquidity of commodity markets vary substantially\n \n\n\n \n112\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbetween \nregions and time periods, the availability of observable inputs for substantially the full term and value of the Companies’ over-the-counter derivative contracts is subject to change.\n \nDerivative Instruments\nThe Companies are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products they market and purchase, as well as interest rate \nand foreign currency exchange rate risks\n in their business operations. The Companies use derivative instruments such as physical and financial forwards, futures, swaps, options, foreign currency transactions and FTRs to manage the commodity, interest rate and/or foreign currency exchange rate risks of their business operations.\n \nDerivative assets and liabilities are presented gross on the Companies’ Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative contracts representing unrealized gain positions and purchased options are reported as derivative assets. Derivative contracts representing unrealized losses and options sold are reported as derivative liabilities. All derivatives, except those for which an exception applies, are required to be reported at fair value. One of the exceptions to fair value accounting, normal purchases and normal sales, may be elected when the contract satisfies certain criteria, including a requirement that physical delivery of the underlying commodity is probable. Expenses and revenues resulting from deliveries under normal purchase contracts and normal sales contracts, respectively, are included in earnings at the time of contract performance. See \nFair Value Measurements\n above for additional information about fair value measurements and associated valuation methods for derivatives.\nThe Companies’ derivative contracts include both over-the-counter transactions and those that are executed on an exchange or other trading platform (exchange contracts) and centrally cleared. Over-the-counter contracts are bilateral contracts that are transacted directly with a third party. Exchange contracts utilize a financial intermediary, exchange or clearinghouse to enter, execute or clear the transactions. Certain over-the-counter and exchange contracts contain contractual rights of offset through master netting arrangements, derivative clearing agreements and contract default provisions. In addition, the contracts are subject to conditional rights of offset through counterparty nonperformance, insolvency or other conditions.\nIn general, most over-the-counter transactions and all exchange contracts are subject to collateral requirements. Types of collateral for over-the-counter and exchange contracts include cash, letters of credit, and in some cases, other forms of security, none of which are subject to restrictions.\n \nThe Companies do not offset amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. Dominion Energy had margin assets of $\n104\n million and $\n38\n million associated with cash collateral at December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, respectively. Dominion Energy had margin liabilities of $\n3\n million and $\n15\n million associated with cash collateral at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Virginia Power had margin assets of $\n1\n million and $\n35\n million associated with cash collateral at December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, respectively. Virginia Power had \nno\n margin liabilities associated with cash collateral at December 31, \n2024 or 2023. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives.\n \nTo manage price and interest rate risk, the Companies hold derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. However, to the extent the Companies do not hold offsetting positions for such derivatives, they believe these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate their exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or interest rates. All income statement activity, including amounts realized upon settlement, is presented in operating revenue, operating expenses, interest and related charges or discontinued operations based on the nature of the underlying risk.\n \nChanges in the fair value of derivative instruments result in the recognition of regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities for jurisdictions subject to cost-based rate regulation. Realized gains or losses on the derivative instruments are generally recognized when the related transactions impact earnings.\n \nDerivative Instruments Designated as Hedging Instruments\n \nIn accordance with accounting guidance pertaining to derivatives and hedge accounting, the Companies designate a portion of their derivative instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For derivative instruments that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, the cash flows from the derivatives and from the related hedged items are classified in operating cash flows.\n \nCash Flow Hedges\nThe \nCompanies’ derivatives designated into cash flow hedges primarily consist of interest rate swaps to hedge the Companies’ exposure to variations in interest rates on long-term debt. For transactions in which the Companies are hedging the variability of cash flows, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in AOCI, to the extent they are effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item, or as appropriate to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Any derivative gains or losses reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the forecasted item is included in earnings, or earlier, if it becomes probable that the forecasted\n \n\n\n \n113\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ntransaction \nwill not occur. For cash flow hedge transactions, hedge accounting is discontinued if the occurrence of the forecasted transaction is no longer probable.\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at lower of original cost or fair value, if impaired. Capitalized costs include labor, materials and other direct and indirect costs such as asset retirement costs, capitalized interest and, for certain operations subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, AFUDC and overhead costs. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including minor additions and replacements, is generally charged to expense as it is incurred.\n \nAmounts capitalized to property, plant and equipment for capitalized interest costs and AFUDC for the Companies are as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapitalized interest costs and AFUDC debt\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n152\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n109\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n43\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n47\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n27\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFUDC equity\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n109\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n96\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe Companies include AFUDC equity in other adjustments within operating activities in their Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nUnder Virginia law, certain Virginia jurisdictional projects qualify for current recovery of AFUDC through rate adjustment clauses. AFUDC on these projects is calculated and recorded as a regulatory asset and is not capitalized to property, plant and equipment. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, Virginia Power recorded $\n3\n million, less than $\n1\n million and $\n34\n million of AFUDC related to these projects, respectively.\n \nFor property subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, the undepreciated cost of such property, less salvage value, is generally charged to accumulated depreciation at retirement. Cost of removal collections from utility customers are recorded as regulatory liabilities. For property subject to cost-of-service rate regulation that will be abandoned significantly before the end of its useful life, the net carrying value is reclassified from plant-in-service when it becomes probable it will be abandoned and recorded as a regulatory asset for amounts expected to be collected through future rates.\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, Virginia Power had the following charges, recorded in impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment), related to early retirements and abandonments:\n \n•\nIn 2024, Virginia Power recorded charges of $\n40\n million ($\n30\n million after-tax) associated with dismantling of certain electric generation facilities. In addition, Virginia Power recorded a $\n25\n million ($\n18\n million after-tax) charge in 2024 related to the write-off of early-stage development costs associated with a hydroelectric pumped storage facility that it is no longer considering constructing.\n•\nIn 2023, Virginia Power recorded a charge of $\n25\n million ($\n19\n million after-tax) as a result of the abandonment of long-lived assets associated with certain rooftop solar and other projects before the end of their useful lives.\n•\nIn 2022, Virginia Power recorded charges of $\n167\n million ($\n124\n million after-tax) associated with dismantling of certain electric generation facilities.\nFor property that is not subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, including nonutility property, cost of removal not associated with AROs is charged to expense as incurred. The Companies also record gains and losses upon retirement based upon the difference between the proceeds received, if any, and the property’s net book value at the retirement date.\n \nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed on the straight-line method based on projected service lives. \nThe Companies’ average composite depreciation rates on utility property, plant and equipment are as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December\n \n31,\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(percent)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominion Energy\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.59\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.65\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.71\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransmission\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.32\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.32\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.32\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.73\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.72\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.80\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.97\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.20\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.31\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.66\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.75\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.84\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransmission\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.29\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.29\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.29\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.77\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.78\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.76\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.29\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.60\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.78\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n114\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nExcludes rates for depreciation reported as discontinued operations.\nIn January 2022, Dominion Energy revised the estimated useful life of its non-jurisdictional and certain nonregulated solar generation facilities to \n35\n years. This revision resulted in an annual decrease of depreciation expense of $\n16\n million ($\n12\n million after-tax), including $\n6\n million ($\n4\n million after-tax) at Virginia Power, and increased Dominion Energy’s EPS by approximately $\n0.02\n.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Virginia Power revised the depreciation rates for its assets to reflect the results of a new depreciation study. The change resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense in Virginia Power’s Consolidated Statements of Income of $\n60\n million ($\n45\n million after-tax) and increased Dominion Energy’s EPS by $\n0.05\n.\nIn December 2023, Dominion Energy revised the estimated useful lives for Millstone Units 2 and 3 to reflect lower depreciation rates as a result of its expectation that a 20-year license extension is approved for these facilities. This revision resulted in a 2024 annual decrease of depreciation expense of $\n35\n million ($\n26\n million after-tax) and increased Dominion Energy’s 2024 EPS by $\n0.03\n. For the year ended December 31, 2023, this revision resulted in an inconsequential impact.\n \nIn January 2024, Virginia Power revised the depreciation rates for Bath County as a result of its expectation that a license extension of at least 40 years will be approved for this facility. This revision resulted in an annual decrease of depreciation expense of $\n17\n million ($\n13\n million after-tax) and increased Dominion Energy's EPS by $\n0.02\n.\n \nVirginia Power’s non-jurisdictional solar generation property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of \n35\n years.\n \nCapitalized costs of development wells and leaseholds were amortized on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method and the estimated proved developed or total proved gas and oil reserves, at a rate of $\n1.83\n, $\n1.73\n and $\n1.67\n per mcfe in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Depletion associated with Wexpro's operations is reflected within discontinued operations through May 2024. See Note 3 for additional information.\nDominion Energy’s nonutility property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset\n\n\n \n\n\nEstimated\n \nUseful\n \nLives\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonregulated generation-nuclear\n\n\n \n\n\n54\n-\n64\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonregulated generation-other\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n-\n35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral and other\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n-\n50 years\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe estimated useful life for a generation station is made on a unit basis if the facility has multiple generating units and represents the period the unit was placed in service or acquired until the end of its license or estimated service period.\nNuclear fuel used in electric generation is amortized over its estimated service life on a units-of-production basis. The Companies report the amortization of nuclear fuel in electric fuel and other energy-related purchases expense in their Consolidated Statements of Income and in depreciation and amortization in their Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n \nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\n \nThe Companies perform an evaluation for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets or intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. A long-lived or intangible asset is written down to fair value if the sum of its expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying amount. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 6 for further discussion on the impairment of long-lived assets.\nAccounting for Regulated Operations\nThe accounting for the Companies’ regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that the Companies are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds or other benefits through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. In addition, a loss is recognized if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made.\n \n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Companies recorded a net $\n103\n million ($\n77\n million after-tax) charge for Virginia Power’s share of costs not expected to be recovered from customers on the CVOW Commercial Project as a result of a revised total project cost estimate of approximately $\n10.7\n billion, \nexcluding financing costs, that reflects a revised estimate of network upgrade costs assigned\n \n\n\n \n115\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nby \nPJM to the CVOW Commercial Project and cost sharing mechanism included in the Virginia Commission’s December 2022 order. The expected total project cost reflects increases driven primarily by projections for onshore electrical interconnection costs and network upgrade costs assigned to the project by PJM, specifically incorporating consideration of PJM’s December 2024 publication of potential transmission network upgrades required for certain generation projects and related cost allocations, including those attributable to the CVOW Commercial Project. Relative to Virginia Power’s November 2024 Rider OSW filing, the updated estimated total project cost reflects an approximately $\n0.6\n billion increase for such onshore and network upgrade costs and an approximately $\n0.3\n billion increase for increased contingency for remaining construction activities, completion of the removal of unexploded ordnance, undersea cable protection system design enhancements, commodity prices for transportation fuel, updates for sea fastener fabrication and installation and other construction and equipment supplier costs.\n \nThe estimated total project cost reflects the Companies’ best estimate of the remaining construction costs, including contingency of approximately \n5\n% on such remaining amounts. Such estimate could potentially change for items, certain of which are beyond the Companies’ control, including but not limited to actual network upgrade costs allocated by PJM, fuel for transportation and installation, the impact of applicable tariffs, if any, costs to maintain necessary permits, approvals and authorizations, ability of key suppliers and contractors to timely satisfy their obligations under existing contracts, marine wildlife and/or any severe weather events.  Any additional increase in such costs in excess of the contingency included in the estimated total project cost would be subject to the cost sharing mechanisms described above and could have a material impact on the Companies’ future financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. See Note 10 for additional information.\n \n \nThe Companies evaluate whether or not recovery of their regulatory assets through future rates is probable as well as whether a regulatory liability due to customers is probable and make various assumptions in their analyses. These analyses are generally based on:\n \n•\nOrders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation and judicial actions;\n•\nPast experience;\n•\nDiscussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel;\n•\nEstimated construction costs;\n•\nForecasted earnings; and \n•\nConsiderations around the likelihood of impacts from events such as unusual weather conditions, extreme weather events and other natural disasters and unplanned outages of facilities. \nGenerally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. A regulatory liability, if considered probable, will be recorded in the period such assessment is made or reversed into earnings if no longer probable. In connection with the future 2025 Biennial Review, the Companies concluded that it was not probable that Virginia Power would have earnings in excess of an expected authorized ROE of \n9.70\n% for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024. As a result, no regulatory liability for Virginia Power ratepayer credits to customers has been recorded at December 31, 2024. See Note 13 for additional information.\nLeases\nThe Companies lease certain assets including vehicles, real estate, office equipment and other operational assets under both operating and finance leases. For the Companies’ operating leases, rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement, subject to regulatory framework. Rent expense associated with operating leases, short-term leases and variable leases is primarily recorded in other operations and maintenance expense in the Companies’ Consolidated Statements of Income. Rent expense associated with finance leases results in the separate presentation of interest expense on the lease liability and amortization expense of the related right-of-use asset in the Companies’ Consolidated Statements of Income or, subject to regulatory framework, is deferred within regulatory assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized into the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nCertain of the Companies’ leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease from \none\n to \n70\n years. The exercise of renewal options is solely at the Companies’ discretion and is included in the lease term if the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. A right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for leases with original lease terms of one year or less are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless such leases contain renewal options that the Companies are reasonably certain will be exercised. Additionally, certain of the Companies’ leases contain escalation clauses whereby payments are adjusted for consumer price or other indices or contain fixed dollar or percentage increases. The Companies also have leases with variable payments based upon usage of, or revenues associated with, the leased assets.\n\n\n \n116\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe determination of the discount rate utilized has a significant impact on the calculation of the present value of the lease liability included in the Companies’ Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the Companies’ fleet of leased vehicles, the discount rate is equal to the prevailing borrowing rate earned by the lessor. For the Companies’ remaining leased assets, the discount rate implicit in the lease is generally unable to be determined from a lessee perspective. As such, the Companies use internally-developed incremental borrowing rates as a discount rate in the calculation of the present value of the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rates are determined based on an analysis of the Companies’ publicly available unsecured borrowing rates, adjusted for a collateral discount, over various lengths of time that most closely correspond to the Companies’ lease maturities.\n \nIn addition, Dominion Energy acts as lessor under certain power purchase agreements in which the counterparty or counterparties purchase substantially all of the output of certain solar facilities. These leases are considered operating in nature. For such leasing arrangements, rental revenue and an associated accounts receivable are recorded when the monthly output of the solar facility is determined. Depreciation on these solar facilities is computed on a straight-line basis primarily over an estimated useful life of \n35\n years.\n \nAsset Retirement Obligations\n \nThe Companies recognize AROs at fair value as incurred or when sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of future retirement activities to be performed, for which a legal obligation exists. These amounts are generally capitalized as costs of the related tangible long-lived assets. Since relevant market information is not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. Quarterly, the Companies assess their AROs to determine if circumstances indicate that estimates of the amounts or timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities have changed. AROs are adjusted when significant changes in the amounts or timing of future cash flows are identified. Dominion Energy reports accretion of AROs and depreciation on asset retirement costs associated with its natural gas pipelines of its distribution business as an adjustment to the related regulatory assets or liabilities when revenue is recoverable from customers for AROs. The Companies report accretion of AROs and depreciation on asset retirement costs associated with decommissioning its nuclear power stations as an adjustment to the regulatory asset or liability for certain jurisdictions. Additionally, the Companies report accretion of AROs and depreciation on asset retirement costs associated with certain rider and prospective rider projects and other electric generation and distribution facilities as an adjustment to the regulatory asset for certain jurisdictions. Accretion of all other AROs and depreciation of all other asset retirement costs are reported in other operations and maintenance expense and depreciation expense, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDebt Issuance Cost\ns\n \nThe Companies defer and amortize debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts over the expected lives of the respective debt issues, considering maturity dates and, if applicable, redemption rights held by others. Deferred debt issuance costs are recorded as a reduction in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of the issuance costs is reported as interest expense. Unamortized costs associated with redemptions of debt securities prior to stated maturity dates are generally recognized and recorded in interest expense immediately. As permitted by regulatory authorities, gains or losses resulting from the refinancing or redemption of debt allocable to utility operations subject to cost-based rate regulation are deferred and amortized.\n \nInvestments\n \nDebt Securities\nDominion Energy accounts for and classifies investments in debt securities as trading or available-for-sale securities. Virginia Power classifies investments in debt securities as available-for-sale securities.\n•\nDebt securities classified as trading securities\n include securities held by Dominion Energy in rabbi trusts associated with certain deferred compensation plans. These securities are reported in other investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with net realized and unrealized gains and losses included in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n•\nDebt securities classified as available-for-sale securities \ninclude all other debt securities, primarily comprised of securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts. These investments are reported at fair value in nuclear decommissioning trust funds in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses (including any credit-related impairments) on investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts are deferred to a regulatory asset or liability, as applicable, for certain jurisdictions subject to cost-based regulation. For all other available-for-sale debt securities, including those held in Dominion Energy’s nonregulated generation nuclear decommissioning trusts, net realized gains and losses (including any credit-related impairments) are included in other income and unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of AOCI, after-tax.\nIn determining realized gains and losses for debt securities, the cost basis of the security is based on the specific identification method.\n\n\n \n117\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCredit Impairment\nThe Companies periodically review their available-for-sale debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value should be considered credit related. If a decline in the fair value of any available-for-sale debt security is determined to be credit related, the credit-related impairment is recorded to an allowance included in nuclear decommissioning trust funds in the Companies’ Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of the reporting period, with such allowance for credit losses subject to reversal in subsequent evaluations.\nUsing information obtained from their nuclear decommissioning trust fixed-income investment managers, the Companies record in earnings, or defer as applicable for certain jurisdictions subject to cost-based regulation, any unrealized loss for a debt security when the manager intends to sell the debt security or it is more-likely-than-not that the manager will have to sell the debt security before recovery of its fair value up to its cost basis. If that is not the case, but the debt security is deemed to have experienced a credit loss, the Companies record the credit loss in earnings or defer as applicable for certain jurisdictions subject to cost-based regulation, with the remaining non-credit portion of the unrealized loss recorded in AOCI. Credit losses are evaluated primarily by considering the credit ratings of the issuer, prior instances of non-performance by the issuer and other factors.\nEquity Securities with Readily Determinable Fair Values\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values include securities held by Dominion Energy in rabbi trusts associated with certain deferred compensation plans and securities held by the Companies in the nuclear decommissioning trusts. The Companies record all equity securities with a readily determinable fair value, or for which they are permitted to estimate fair value using NAV (or its equivalent), at fair value in nuclear decommissioning trust funds and other investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts are deferred to a regulatory asset or liability, as applicable, for certain jurisdictions subject to cost-based regulation. For all other equity securities, including those held in Dominion Energy’s nonregulated generation nuclear decommissioning trusts and rabbi trusts, net realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nEquity Securities without Readily Determinable Fair Values\nThe Companies account for illiquid and privately held securities without readily determinable fair values under either the equity method or cost method. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values include:\n•\nEquity method investments\n when the Companies have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Dominion Energy’s investments are included in investments in equity method affiliates in its Consolidated Balance Sheets, except for the liability to Atlantic Coast Pipeline or where such investments are classified as held for sale. Dominion Energy records equity method adjustments in other income in its Consolidated Statements of Income, including its proportionate share of investee income or loss, gains or losses resulting from investee capital transactions, amortization of certain differences between the carrying value and the equity in the net assets of the investee at the date of investment and other adjustments required by the equity method.\n•\nCost method investments\n when the Companies do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. The Companies’ investments are included in other investments and nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Cost method investments are reported at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\nThe Companies periodically review their equity method investments to determine whether a decline in fair value should be considered other-than-temporary. If a decline in the fair value of any security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value at the end of the reporting period.\n \nInventories\nMaterials and supplies and fossil fuel inventories are valued primarily using the weighted-average cost method. Stored gas inventory is valued using the weighted-average cost method, except for East Ohio’s gas distribution operations, which were valued using the LIFO method and reflected in assets held for sale in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023. Under the LIFO method, current stored gas inventory was valued at $\n18\n million at December 31, 2023. Based on the average price of gas purchased during 2023, the cost of replacing the current portion of stored gas inventory exceeded the amount stated on a LIFO basis by $\n42\n million.\nIn 2024, Dominion Energy wrote off certain inventory balances in connection with the electric base rate case in South Carolina as discussed in Note 13. In 2022, Dominion Energy wrote off certain inventory balances associated with certain nonrenewable electric generation facilities resulting in a $\n40\n million charge ($\n30\n million after-tax) recorded in impairment of assets and other charges (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment) in its Consolidated Statements of Income, including $\n19\n million ($\n14\n million after-tax) at Virginia Power, for inventory not utilized at such facilities prior to their retirement in the first half of 2023.\n\n\n \n118\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGoodwill\n \nDominion Energy evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of April 1 and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy's current period calculations of the expected gain or loss on the Questar Gas and East Ohio Transactions resulted in an impairment of the related goodwill. There were \nno\n other impairments recorded in 2024. See Note 3 for additional information.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSegment Disclosures\n \nIn November 2023, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for reportable segments. The revised guidance requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires disclosure of the title and position of the CODM. The revised guidance does not change how an entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented. This revised guidance only impacted the Companies’ disclosures with no impacts to their results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIncome Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for income taxes. The revised guidance requires disclosure of disaggregated information about an entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and allows either prospective or retrospective application. The Companies expect this revised guidance to only impact their disclosures with no impacts to their results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nClimate-Related Disclosures\n \nIn March 2024, the SEC issued guidance for climate-related disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure of the financial statement impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions, including amounts capitalized or expensed as well as any associated recoveries. In addition, the guidance requires disclosure of amounts related to renewable energy credits or carbon offsets if utilized as a material component of plans to achieve climate-related targets or goals. This guidance is currently subject to a stay issued by the SEC. Should this guidance become effective, the Companies expect it to only impact their disclosures with no impacts to their results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures\n \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for income statement expense disaggregation disclosures. The revised guidance requires disclosure of disaggregated information about specific expense categories in commonly presented income statement expense captions. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted and allows either prospective or retrospective application. The Companies expect this revised guidance to only impact their disclosures with no impacts to their results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n\n\nNOTE \n3. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\n \nBusiness Review Dispositions\n \nSale of East Ohio\n \nIn September 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement with Enbridge for the East Ohio Transaction, which included the sale of East Ohio and was valued at approximately $\n6.6\n billion, consisting of a purchase price of approximately $\n4.3\n billion in cash and approximately $\n2.3\n billion \nof assumed indebtedness. The sale closed in March 2024 after all customary closing and regulatory conditions were satisfied, including clearance or approval under or by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, CFIUS and FCC. Dominion Energy utilized the after-tax proceeds, as required, to repay outstanding borrowings under 364-day term loan facilities. See Note 17 for additional information. The purchase price was subject to customary post-closing adjustments, including adjustments for cash, indebtedness, net working capital, capital expenditures and net regulatory assets and liabilities. The transaction was structured as a stock sale for tax purposes. In October 2023, as required under the sale agreement, Dominion Energy filed a notice with the Ohio Commission. The internal reorganization in connection with the East Ohio Transaction was subject to approval by the Utah and\n \n\n\n \n119\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWyoming \nCommissions. Dominion Energy filed for such approvals in September 2023 which were received in November 2023. The internal reorganization was completed in February 2024.\n \nDominion Energy retained the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations, including related income tax and other deferred balances, associated with retiree participants in both East Ohio’s union pension and other postretirement benefit plans and retiree participants of the sale entities in the Dominion Energy Pension Plan and the Dominion Energy Retiree Health and Welfare Plan. Dominion Energy recognized a pre-tax loss of $\n97\n million ($\n109\n million after-tax loss) upon the closing of the transaction, including the write-off of $\n1.5\n billion of goodwill which was not deductible for tax purposes and including the effects of final closing adjustments. In 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n29\n million to reflect the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of East Ohio’s stock upon meeting the classification as held for sale. These deferred taxes reversed in the first quarter of 2024 upon closing of the sale and became a component of current income tax expense on the loss on sale disclosed above. See Note 5 for additional information.\n \nAt the closing of the East Ohio Transaction, Dominion Energy and Enbridge entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which Dominion Energy will continue to provide certain services to support the ongoing operations of East Ohio for up to approximately two years. Enbridge has also agreed to provide certain services to Dominion Energy.\nSale of PSNC\n \nIn September 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement with Enbridge for the PSNC Transaction, which included the sale of PSNC. The sale closed in September 2024 after all customary closing and regulatory conditions were satisfied, including clearance or approval under or by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, CFIUS, FCC and North Carolina Commission. At closing, the transaction was valued at $\n3.3\n billion, consisting of a purchase price of $\n2.0\n billion in cash and $\n1.3\n billion of assumed indebtedness. The purchase price is subject to customary post-closing adjustments, including adjustments for cash, indebtedness, net working capital, capital expenditures and net regulatory assets and liabilities. The transaction was structured as a stock sale for tax purposes. The internal reorganization in connection with the PSNC Transaction was subject to approval by the North Carolina Commission. Dominion Energy filed for such approval in September 2023 which was received in November 2023. The internal reorganization was completed in December 2023.\nDominion Energy retained the entirety of the assets and obligations, including related income tax and other deferred balances, of the pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans associated with the operations included in the transaction and relating to services provided through closing. Dominion Energy recognized a pre-tax loss of $\n35\n million ($\n31\n million after-tax loss) upon the closing of the transaction, including the write-off of $\n0.7\n billion of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes and including the effects of final closing adjustments. In 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n334\n million to reflect the deferred taxes on the outside basis of PSNC’s stock upon meeting the classification as held for sale. Dominion Energy recorded an additional charge of $\n16\n million to adjust these deferred taxes to recorded balances as of June 30, 2024. These deferred taxes reversed in the third quarter of 2024 upon closing of the sale and became a component of current income tax expense on the pre-tax loss on sale disclosed above. See Note 5 for additional information.\n \nAt the closing of the PSNC Transaction, Dominion Energy and Enbridge entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which Dominion Energy will continue to provide certain services to support the ongoing operations of PSNC for up to approximately two years. Enbridge has also agreed to provide certain services to Dominion Energy.\nSale of Questar Gas and Wexpro\n \nIn September 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement with Enbridge for the Questar Gas Transaction, which included the sale of Questar Gas, Wexpro and related affiliates and was valued at approximately $\n4.3\n billion, consisting of a purchase price of approximately $\n3.0\n billion in cash and approximately $\n1.3\n billion of assumed indebtedness. The sale closed in May 2024 after all customary closing and regulatory conditions were satisfied, including clearance or approval under or by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, CFIUS, FCC and Utah and Wyoming Commissions. Dominion Energy utilized the after-tax proceeds, as required, to repay outstanding borrowings under a 364-day term loan facility. See Note 17 for additional information. The purchase price was subject to customary post-closing adjustments, including adjustments for cash, indebtedness, net working capital, capital expenditures and net regulatory assets and liabilities. The transaction was structured as a stock sale for tax purposes. In October 2023, as required under the sale agreement, Dominion Energy filed the notice with the Idaho Commission. The internal reorganization in connection with the Questar Gas Transaction was subject to approval by the Utah and Wyoming Commissions. Dominion Energy filed for such approvals in September 2023 which were received in November 2023. The internal reorganization was completed in February 2024.\nDominion Energy retained the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations, including related income tax and other deferred balances, associated with retiree participants of the sale entities in the Dominion Energy Pension Plan and the Dominion Energy Retiree Health and Welfare Plan. Dominion Energy recognized a pre-tax gain of $\n2\n million ($\n42\n million after-tax gain) upon the closing of the transaction, including the write-off of $\n0.7\n billion of goodwill which was not deductible for tax purposes and including the effects of final closing adjustments. In 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n236\n million ($\n231\n million after-tax), including amounts associated with an impairment of goodwill. Based on the recorded balances at March 31, 2024, Dominion Energy recorded an additional charge of $\n78\n million ($\n78\n million \nafter-tax), including amounts associated with an\n \n\n\n \n120\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nimpairment \nof goodwill, in the first quarter of 2024. Following the internal reorganization noted above and upon closing of the East Ohio Transaction, Dominion Energy recorded a tax benefit of $\n5\n million. In 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n472\n million to reflect the deferred taxes on the outside basis of Questar Gas, Wexpro and related affiliates’ stock upon meeting the classification as held for sale. These deferred taxes reversed in the first quarter of 2024 and became a component of current income tax expense. In addition, Dominion Energy recorded an incremental deferred tax benefit of $\n10\n million to reflect the deferred taxes on the outside basis of Questar Gas, Wexpro and related affiliates’ stock in the first quarter of 2024. These deferred taxes reversed in the second quarter of 2024 upon closing of the sale and became a component of current income tax expense on the pre-tax loss on sale disclosed above. See Note 5 for additional information.\nAt the closing of the Questar Gas Transaction, Dominion Energy and Enbridge entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which Dominion Energy will continue to provide certain services to support the ongoing operations of Questar Gas and Wexpro for up to approximately two years. Enbridge has also agreed to provide certain services to Dominion Energy.\nOther Sales\n \nIn February 2024, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement with AES to sell Birdseye and the Madison solar project for approximately $\n17\n million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, which closed in April 2024. Dominion Energy had previously recognized a charge of $\n68\n million ($\n51\n million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2023 to adjust the assets down to their realizable fair value. As a result, the gain on the sale recognized by Dominion Energy in the second quarter of 2024, including the effects of final closing adjustments, was inconsequential.\nIn August 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement and completed the sale of Tredegar Solar Fund I, LLC to Spruce Power for cash consideration of $\n21\n million.\n \nFinancial Statement Information for Business Review Dispositions\nThe following table represents selected information regarding the results of operations, which were reported within discontinued operations in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nEast Ohio Transaction\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPSNC Transaction\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQuestar Gas Transaction\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating revenue\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n229\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n488\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n894\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating expense\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n247\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n313\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n724\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n8\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income (expense)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n17\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest and related charges\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n50\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n142\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n147\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Dominion Energy\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n61\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n98\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n93\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nRepresents amoun\nts attributable to Dominion Energy prior to the closing of the East Ohio Transaction which closed on March 6, 2024, the PSNC Transaction w\nhich closed on September 30, 2024 and the Questar Gas Transaction which closed on May 31, 2024.\n(2)\nEast Ohio Transaction includes a charge of $\n45\n million ($\n33\n million after-tax) associated with an increase to certain pension retirement benefits attributable to a plan amendment and a contribution to the defined contribution employee savings plan.

The sale was treated as a stock sale for tax purposes.\nIn connection with closing, Dominion Energy recognized a pre-tax gain of $\n28\n million, inclusive of customary closing adjustments, (net of $\n110\n million write-off of goodwill which was not deductible for tax purposes) in losses (gains) on sales of assets in its Consolidated Statements of Income. The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of $\n73\n million. Upon meeting the classification as held for sale in the first quarter of 2022 and through the second quarter of 2022, Dominion Energy had recorded charges of $\n90\n million in deferred income tax expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income to reflect the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of Hope’s stock. This deferred income tax expense reversed upon closing of the sale and became a component of current income tax expense on the sale disclosed above. See Note 5 for additional information. In addition, a curtailment was recorded related to other postretirement benefit plans as discussed in Note 22.\nAll activity related to Hope is reflected in the Corporate and Other segment.\nSale of Kewaunee\nIn May 2021, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement to sell \n100\n% of the equity interests in Dominion Energy Kewaunee, Inc. to EnergySolutions, including the transfer of all decommissioning obligations associated with Kewaunee, which ceased operations in 2013. The sale closed in June 2022 following approval from the Wisconsin Commission in May 2022 and NRC approval of a requested license transfer in March 2022. The sale was treated as an asset sale for tax purposes and Dominion Energy retained the assets and obligations of the pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans. EnergySolutions is subject to the Wisconsin regulatory conditions agreed to by Dominion Energy upon its acquisition of Kewaunee, including the return of any excess decommissioning funds to WPSC and WP&L customers following completion of all decommissioning activities.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, Dominion Energy recorded a loss of $\n649\n million ($\n513\n million after-tax), recorded in losses (gains) on sales of assets in its Consolidated Statements of Income, primarily related to the difference between the nuclear decommissioning trust and AROs. Prior to its receipt, there had been uncertainty as to the timing of or ability to obtain approval from the Wisconsin Commission. Prior to closing, Dominion Energy withdrew $\n80\n million from the nuclear decommissioning trust to recover certain spent nuclear fuel and other permitted costs.\nAll activity related to Kewaunee prior to closing is included in Contracted Energy, with remaining activity reflected in the Corporate and Other segment.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n123\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTE \n4.

Virginia Power for years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively.\n \nNeither Dominion Energy nor Virginia Power have any amounts for revenue to be recognized in the future on multi-year contracts in place at December 31, 2024\n.\nContract liabilities represent an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration, or the amount that is due, from the customer. At December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, Dominion Energy’s contract liability balances were $\n52\n million and $\n47\n million, respectively. At \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, Virginia Power’s contract liability balances were $\n46\n million and $\n40\n million, respectively. The Companies’ contract liabilities are recorded in other current liabilities and other deferred credits and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \nThe Companies recognize revenue as they fulfill their obligations to provide service to their customers. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, Dominion Energy recognized revenue of $\n45\n million and $\n48\n million from the beginning contract liability balance. During the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, Virginia Power recognized revenue of $\n40\n million and $\n39\n million, respectively, from the beginning contract liability balance.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNOTE \n5. INCOME TAXES\n \nJudgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws and associated regulations involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. The Companies are routinely audited by federal and state tax authorities. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.\nIn August 2022, the IRA was enacted which, among other things, extends the investment and production tax credits for clean energy technologies until at least \n2032\n, provides for transferability of certain tax credits and imposes a \n15\n% alternative minimum tax on corporations with GAAP net income greater than $\n1\n billion, \nas adjusted for certain items, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA did not impact the measurement of the Companies’ deferred income taxes or change the Companies' assessment of the\n \n\n\n \n124\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrealizability \nof deferred tax assets.  The Companies continue to monitor and evaluate the impacts of the IRA, including changes in the Companies' interpretations, if any, as guidance is issued and finalized.\nAs indicated in Note 2, certain of the Companies’ operations, including accounting for income taxes, are subject to regulatory accounting treatment. For regulated operations, many of the changes in deferred taxes from the 2017 Tax Reform Act represent amounts probable of collection from or return to customers and are presented as components of regulatory assets or liabilities. See Note 13 for additional information and current year developments.\nContinuing Operations\n \nDetails of income tax expense for continuing operations including noncontrolling interests were as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December\n \n31,\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n235\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n385\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n76\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n23\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n116\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n17\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n99\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n17\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal current expense (benefit)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n203\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n484\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n49\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n110\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxes before operating loss \n   carryforwards and investment tax credits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n446\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n758\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n325\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n406\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n215\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTax utilization expense of operating \n   loss carryforwards\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n277\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n59\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n107\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n108\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal deferred expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n546\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,080\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n149\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n385\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n513\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n323\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment tax credits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n35\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n28\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n41\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n21\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n14\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n29\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal income tax expense\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n308\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n568\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n59\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n408\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n389\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n294\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Dominion Energy’s current income taxes reflect a benefit from continuing operations as the income tax expense associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions, is reflected in discontinued operations. Dominion Energy’s income tax expense from continuing operations reflects the utilization of tax credit carryforwards to offset a portion of the federal tax on the gains from the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions, presented in discontinued operations.\nIn 2023, Dominion Energy’s current income taxes reflect a benefit from continuing operations as the income tax expense associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions and Cove Point operations, including the Cove Point gain, is reflected in discontinued operations. Dominion Energy’s income tax expense from continuing operations reflects the utilization of investment tax credit carryforwards to offset a portion of the federal tax on the Cove Point gain, presented in discontinued operations.\n \nIn 2022, Dominion Energy’s current income taxes reflect a benefit from continuing operations as the income tax expense associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions and Cove Point operations is reflected in discontinued operations.\n \nDiscontinued Operations\nIncome tax expense reflected in discontinued operations is $\n31\n million, $\n1.3\n billion, and $\n207\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively. As discussed in Note 3, Dominion Energy entered into agreements for the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions in September 2023, each of which was treated as a stock sale for income tax purposes. During 2023 in connection with the pending sales, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n835\n million to establish deferred tax liabilities to reflect the excess of the financial reporting basis over tax basis in the stock of the entities to be sold. These deferred taxes reversed upon closing of the respective sales, all of which occurred in 2024. In addition, Dominion Energy recorded tax expense of $\n278\n million associated wi\nth completing the sale in September 2023 of its remaining \n50\n% noncontrolling partnership interest in Cove Point to BHE as discussed in Note 9. During 2024, Dominion Energy recorded a tax benefit of $\n39\n million, including the reversal of $\n851\n million of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions previously established during 2023 and 2024. Income taxes reflect tax expense on pre-tax income attributable to East Ohio, PSNC, Questar Gas, Wexpro and equity method earnings from Cove Point of $\n60\n million, $\n116\n million and $\n242\n million, partially offset by an income tax benefit of $\n11\n million, $\n59\n million and $\n38\n million related to excess deferred income tax amortization for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \n\n\n \n125\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nContinuing Operations\nFor continuing operations including noncontrolling interests, the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate reconciles to the Companies’ effective income tax rate as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve Months Ended December\n \n31,\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. statutory rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.0\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n21.0\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n21.0\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n21.0\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n21.0\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n21.0\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreases (reductions) resulting from:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognition of taxes - sale of \n    subsidiary stock\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognition of taxes - privatization \n   intercompany gain\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment tax credits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n12.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction tax credits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n4.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n4.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n4.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReversal of excess deferred income \n    taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n3.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n25.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n3.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nState legislative change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in state deferred taxes \n    associated with assets held for sale\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFUDC—equity\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSettlements of uncertain tax positions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee stock ownership plan \n    deduction\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.3\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.3\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14.1\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n20.9\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n18.1\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n18.0\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n21.1\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n20.9\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nThe IRA created a nuclear production tax credit for electricity produced and sold beginning in 2024. Dominion Energy’s and Virginia Power’s 2024 effective tax rate includes an $\n89\n million income tax benefit for the estimated net realizable value of the nuclear production tax credit. The ultimate nuclear production tax credit realized by the Companies could vary significantly based on pending final U.S. Treasury guidance.\nDominion Energy’s 2023 effective tax rate includes a net income tax expense of $\n29\n million associated with the remeasurement of consolidated state deferred taxes as a result of the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions and sale of Dominion Energy’s \n50\n% noncontrolling partnership interest in Cove Point as discussed in Notes 3 and 9, respectively.\nIn August 2022, Dominion Energy sold \n100\n% of the equity interests in Hope in a stock sale for income tax purposes. Dominion Energy’s 2022 effective tax rate reflects the current income tax expense on the sale of Hope’s stock. Virginia Power transferred its existing privatization operations in Virginia to Dominion Energy, and Dominion Energy contributed these assets to Dominion Privatization.  As the original owner of these privatization assets, Virginia Power is required to recognize the income tax expense on Dominion Energy’s transaction with Dominion Privatization.

Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations. For Dominion Energy and its subsidiaries, these unrecognized tax benefits were $\n30\n million, $\n52\n million and $\n64\n million at December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively. In discontinued operations, these unrecognized tax benefits were $\n32\n million, $\n38\n million and $\n33\n million at December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, \nrespectively\n.\n For Dominion Energy, the change in these unrecognized tax benefits decreased income tax expense by $\n22\n million, $\n8\n million and $\n7\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDominion Energy participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process, which provides the opportunity to resolve complex tax matters with the IRS before filing its federal income tax returns, thus achieving certainty for such tax return filing positions agreed to by the IRS. The IRS has completed its audit of tax years through 2019. The statute of limitations has not yet expired for years after 2019. Although Dominion Energy has not received a final letter indicating no changes to its taxable income for tax years 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no material adjustments are expected. The IRS examination of tax year 2024 is ongoing.\nIt is reasonably possible that settlement negotiations and expiration of statutes of limitations could result in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in 2025 by up to $\n38\n million for Dominion Energy. If such changes were to occur, other than revisions of the accrual for interest on tax underpayments and overpayments, earnings could increase by up to $\n30\n million for Dominion Energy. Otherwise, with regard to 2024 and prior years, the Companies cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible changes to unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in 2025.\nFor each of the major states in which Dominion Energy operates or previously operated, the earliest tax year remaining open for examination is as follows:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\n \n\n\nEarliest Open Tax Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPennsylvania\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\n \n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtah\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\n \n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nConsidered a major state for entities presented in discontinued operations.\n(2)\nConsidered a major state for Virginia Power’s operations.\n \nThe Companies are also obligated to report adjustments resulting from IRS settlements to state tax authorities. In addition, if Dominion Energy utilizes operating losses or tax credits generated in years for which the statute of limitations has expired, such amounts are generally subject to examination.\n\n\nNOTE \n6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n \nThe Companies’ fair value measurements are made in accordance with the policies discussed in Note 2. See Note 7 for additional information about the Companies’ derivative and hedge accounting activities.\n \nThe Companies enter into certain physical and financial forwards, futures and options, which are considered Level 3 as they have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation. The discounted cash flow method is used to value Level 3 physical and financial forwards and futures contracts. An option model is used to value Level 3 physical options. The discounted cash flow model for forwards and futures calculates mark-to-market valuations based on forward market prices, original transaction prices,\n \n\n\n \n128\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nvolumes, risk-free rate of return and credit spreads. The inputs into the option models are the forward market prices, implied price volatilities, risk-free rate of return, the option expiration dates, the option strike prices, the original sales prices and volumes. For Level 3 fair value measurements, certain forward market prices and implied price volatilities are considered unobservable.\nThe following table presents the Companies’ quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements at December 31, \n2024.

See Note 10 for information regarding impairment charges recorded by Dominion Energy associated with corporate office buildings, nonregulated renewable natural gas facilities and nonregulated solar facilities. See Note 22 for information regarding Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plan remeasurements.\n \nIn 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n15\n million ($\n11\n million after-tax) presented within discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust certain nonregulated solar assets down to their estimated fair value, using a market approach, of $\n22\n million. The valuation is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement given that it is based on bids received. As discussed in Note 3, these assets were sold in August 2023.\n\n\n \n129\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nFair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy with a separate reconciliation of fair value measurements categorized as Level 3.

Estimated fair values have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies considered appropriate by management. The carrying amount of cash, restricted cash and equivalents, customer and other receivables, affiliated receivables, short-term debt, affiliated current borrowings, payables to affiliates and accounts payable are representative of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. \nFor the Companies’ financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, the carrying amounts and estimated fair values are as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCarrying\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEstimated Fair Value\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCarrying\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEstimated Fair  Value\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term debt\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n34,533\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n32,167\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n19,224\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n17,578\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecuritization bonds\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,217\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,218\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,217\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,218\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJunior subordinated notes\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,223\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,372\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term debt\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n42,526\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n40,539\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n17,392\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n16,418\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental credit facility borrowings\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n450\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n450\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJunior subordinated notes\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,388\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,374\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nFair value is estimated using market prices, where available, and interest rates currently available for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING ACTIVITIES\n \nSee Note 2 for the Companies’ accounting policies, objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments. See Notes 2 and 6 for further information about fair value measurements and associated valuation methods for derivatives.\n \n\n\n \n131\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash collateral is used in the table below to offset derivative assets and liabilities. In February 2022, Dominion Energy entered into contracts representing offsetting positions to certain existing exchange contracts with collateral requirements as well as new over-the-counter transactions that are not subject to collateral requirements. These contracts resulted in positions which limit the risk of increased cash collateral requirements. Certain accounts receivable and accounts payable recognized on the Companies’ Consolidated Balance Sheets, letters of credit and other forms of securities, as well as certain other long-term debt, all of which are not included in the tables below, are subject to offset under master netting or similar arrangements and would reduce the net exposure.  See Note 18 for further information regarding other long-term debt, in the form of restructured derivatives, subject to offset under master netting or similar agreements. See Note 24 for further information regarding credit-related contingent features for the Companies derivative instruments.\nBalance Sheet Presentation\n \nThe tables below present the Companies’

Atlantic Coast Pipeline of $\n7\n million and $\n4\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, presented in other current liabilities. See discussion below for additional information.\n(2)\nDominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets includes balances presented in assets held for sale of $\n43\n million for December 31, 2023.\nDominion Energy recorded equity earnings (losses) on its investments of $\n3\n million, $(\n26\n) million and $\n21\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in other income (expense) in its Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, Dominion Energy recorded equity earnings (losses) of $(\n12\n) million, $\n235\n million and $\n271\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in discontinued operations including amounts related to its investments in Cove Point (through September 2023) and Atlantic Coast Pipeline discussed below. Dominion Energy received distributions from these investments of $\n140\n million, $\n245\n million and $\n355\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net difference between the carrying amount of Dominion Energy’s investments and its share of underlying equity in net assets was $\n5\n million and $\n18\n million, respectively. At December 31, 2024, this difference is attributable to capitalized interest. At December 31, 2023, these differences are primarily comprised of $\n9\n million of equity method goodwill that is not being amortized and $\n3\n million attributable to capitalized interest.\nCove Point\nPrior to the completion of the sale to BHE in September 2023, Dominion held a \n50\n% noncontrolling limited partnership interest in Cove Point which was accounted for as an equity method investment as Dominion Energy had the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control, Cove Point.\nDominion Energy recorded distributions from Cove Point of $\n227\n million and $\n344\n million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Dominion Energy made no contributions to Cove Point for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\n \nIn June 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement with Cove Point for transportation and storage services at market rates for a 20-year period commencing August 2023.\nIn July 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement to sell its \n50\n% noncontrolling limited partnership interest in Cove Point to BHE for cash consideration of $\n3.3\n billion which closed in September 2023 after all customary closing and regulatory conditions were satisfied, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and approval from the DOE. The sale is treated as an asset sale for tax purposes. In addition, Dominion Energy received proceeds of $\n199\n million from the settlement of related interest rate derivatives. In connection with closing, Dominion Energy utilized proceeds, as required, to repay DECP Holding’s term loan secured by its noncontrolling interest in Cove Point, which had an outstanding balance of $\n2.2\n billion, and $\n750\n million of outstanding borrowings under Dominion Energy’s two $\n600\n million 364-day term loan facilities entered in July 2023. See Note 17 for additional information on these facilities. Dominion Energy recorded a gain on the sale of its noncontrolling interest in Cove Point of $\n626\n million ($\n348\n million after-tax) within discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn September 2023, as a result of Dominion Energy entering agreements for the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions, Dominion Energy’s \n50\n% noncontrolling limited partnership interest in Cove Point also met the requirements to be presented as discontinued operations and held for sale (through the date of disposal) as both disposition activities were executed in connection with Dominion Energy’s comprehensive business review announced in November 2022.  In addition, interest expense associated with DECP Holding’s term loan secured by its noncontrolling interest in Cove Point and related interest rate derivatives have been classified as discontinued operations.\n \nAmounts presented in discontinued operations within Dominion Energy's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023 include $\n218\n million for earnings on equity method investees, $\n120\n million of interest expense and $\n31\n million of income tax expense, in addition to the gain on sale and associated tax expense disclosed above. Such amounts for the years ended December 31, 2022 were $\n277\n million for earnings on equity method investees, $(\n160\n) million for interest expense (benefit) and $\n92\n million of income tax expense.\n \n\n\n \n140\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAll activity relating to Dominion Energy’s noncontrolling interest in Cove Point is recorded within the Corporate and Other segment.\n \nAtlantic Coast Pipeline\n \nIn September 2014, Dominion Energy, along with Duke Energy and Southern, announced the formation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline for the purpose of constructing an approximately 600-mile natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina. Following Dominion Energy’s acquisition from Southern of its \n5\n% interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline in 2020, Dominion Energy owns a \n53\n% noncontrolling membership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline with Duke Energy owning the remaining interest.\n \nAtlantic Coast Pipeline continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment as the power to direct the activities most significant to Atlantic Coast Pipeline is shared with Duke Energy.  As a result, Dominion Energy has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee.\nIn July 2020, as a result of ongoing permitting delays, growing legal uncertainties and the need to incur significant capital expenditures to maintain project timing before such uncertainties could be resolved, Dominion Energy and Duke Energy announced the cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project.\nDominion Energy recorded earnings (losses) on equity method investees of $(\n13\n) million ($(\n10\n) million after-tax), $\n15\n million ($\n11\n million after-tax), and $(\n7\n) million ($(\n5\n) million after-tax) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In connection with Dominion Energy’s decision to sell substantially all of its gas transmission and storage operations, Dominion Energy has reflected the results of its equity method investment in Atlantic Coast Pipeline as discontinued operations in its Consolidated Statements of Income. As a result of its share of equity losses exceeding its investment, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 include a liability of $\n7\n million and $\n4\n million, respectively, presented in other current liabilities and reflecting Dominion Energy’s obligations to Atlantic Coast Pipeline related to AROs.\nDominion Energy recorded contributions of $\n12\n million, $\n95\n million and $\n3\n million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to Atlantic Coast Pipeline.\nDominion Energy expects it could incur additional losses from Atlantic Coast Pipeline as it completes wind-down activities.  While Dominion Energy is unable to precisely estimate the amounts to be incurred by Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the portion of such amounts attributable to Dominion Energy is not expected to be material to Dominion Energy’s results of operations, financial position or statement of cash flows.\nAll activity relating to Atlantic Coast Pipeline is recorded within the Corporate and Other segment.\nAlign RNG\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Dominion Energy reflected its share of an impairment of certain property, plant and equipment at Align RNG totaling $\n35\n million ($\n26\n million after-tax) in other income (expense) in its Consolidated Statements of Income. All activity related to Align RNG is reflected within Contracted Energy.\nDominion Privatization\nIn \nFebruary 2022\n, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement to form Dominion Privatization, a partnership with Patriot. Dominion Privatization, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, maintains and operates electric and gas distribution infrastructure under service concession arrangements with certain U.S. military installations. Under the agreement, Dominion Energy contributed its existing privatization operations, excluding contracts held by DESC, and Patriot contributed cash.\nThe initial contribution, consisting of privatization operations in South Carolina, Texas and Pennsylvania, closed in March 2022 for which Dominion Energy received total consideration of $\n120\n million, subject to customary closing adjustments, comprised of $\n60\n million in cash proceeds and a \n50\n% noncontrolling ownership interest in Dominion Privatization with an initial fair value of $\n60\n million, estimated using the market approach. This is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement given that it is based on the agreed-upon sales price. In the first quarter of 2022, Dominion Energy recorded a gain of $\n23\n million ($\n16\n million after-tax), presented in losses (gains) on sales of assets in its Consolidated Statements of Income. Dominion Energy’s \n50\n% noncontrolling ownership interest in Dominion Privatization is accounted for as an equity method investment as Dominion Energy has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee.\nThe second contribution, consisting of privatization operations in Virginia, closed in December 2022 for which Dominion Energy received total consideration of $\n215\n million, subject to customary closing adjustments, comprised of $\n108\n million in cash proceeds and retention of its \n50\n% noncontrolling ownership interest valued at $\n107\n million \nusing the market approach. This is considered a\n \n\n\n \n141\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLevel \n2 fair value measurement given that it is based on the agreed-upon sales price. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Dominion Energy recorded a gain of $\n133\n million ($\n99\n million after-tax), presented in losses (gains) on sales of assets in its Consolidated Statements of Income.\n \nIn February 2024, Dominion Energy received a distribution of $\n126\n million from Dominion Privatization, which was accounted for as a return of an investment.\nAll activity related to Dominion Privatization is reflected within the Corporate and Other segment.\nWrangler\nIn March 2022, Dominion Energy sold its \n15\n% noncontrolling partnership interest in Wrangler to Interstate Gas Supply, Inc. for cash consideration of $\n85\n million. Dominion Energy recognized a gain of $\n11\n million ($\n8\n million after-tax), included in other income (expense) in its Consolidated Statements of Income reflected within the Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTE \n10.

The Companies report their share of operating costs in the appropriate operating expense (electric fuel and other energy-related purchases, other operations and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, other taxes and other applicable accounts) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n \nCVOW Commercial Project – Estimated Total Project Cost\nIn September 2019, Virginia Power filed applications with PJM for the CVOW Commercial Project and for certain approvals and rider recovery from the Virginia Commission in November 2021. The Virginia Commission provided such approvals in August 2022, as revised for certain provisions related to rider recovery in December 2022. The \n2.6\n GW project is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2026 with an estimated total project cost of approximately $\n10.7\n billion, excluding financing costs, that reflects a revised estimate of network upgrade costs assigned by PJM to the CVOW Commercial Project.\n \nThe expected total project cost reflects increases driven primarily by projections for onshore electrical interconnection costs and network upgrade costs assigned to the project by PJM, specifically incorporating consideration of PJM’s December 2024 publication of potential transmission network upgrades required for certain generation projects and related cost allocations, including those attributable to the CVOW Commercial Project. Relative to Virginia Power’s November 2024 Rider OSW filing, the updated estimated total project cost reflects an approximately $\n0.6\n billion increase for such onshore and network upgrade costs and an approximately $\n0.3\n billion increase for increased contingency for remaining construction activities, completion of the removal of unexploded ordnance, undersea cable protection system design enhancements, commodity prices for transportation fuel, updates for sea fastener fabrication and installation and other construction and equipment supplier costs. Virginia Power has entered into fixed price contracts for the major offshore construction and equipment components. The contracts include services denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, for which Virginia Power has entered forward contracts to economically hedge.\nIn accordance with the Virginia Commission’s December 2022 order, the Companies are subject to a cost sharing mechanism in which Virginia Power will be eligible to recover 50% of such incremental costs which fall between $\n10.3\n billion and $\n11.3\n billion with no recovery of such incremental costs which fall between $\n11.3\n billion and $\n13.7\n billion. There is no cost sharing mechanism for any total construction costs in excess of $\n13.7\n billion, the recovery of which would be determined in a future Virginia Commission proceeding. In October 2024, Virginia Power completed the sale of a \n50\n% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak as discussed below.\n \nAs a result of the revised total project cost estimate and cost sharing mechanism, in the fourth quarter of 2024 Virginia Power recorded a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers of $\n206\n million within impairment of assets and other charges, which includes $\n103\n million attributable to noncontrolling interests, and an associated income tax benefit of $\n26\n million, all reflected in the Corporate and Other segment, in the Companies’ Consolidated Statements of Income.\n \nThe estimated total project cost above reflects the Companies’ best estimate of the remaining construction costs, including contingency of approximately \n5\n% on such remaining amounts. Such estimate could potentially change for items, certain of which are beyond the Companies’ control, including but not limited to actual network upgrade costs allocated by PJM, fuel for transportation and installation, the impact of applicable tariffs, if any, costs to maintain necessary permits, approvals and authorizations, ability of key suppliers and contractors to timely satisfy their obligations under existing contracts, marine wildlife and/or any severe weather events.  Any additional increase in such costs in excess of the contingency included in the estimated total project cost would be subject to the cost sharing mechanisms described above and could have a material impact on the Companies’ future financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n \nSale of Noncontrolling Interest in CVOW Commercial Project\nIn February 2024, Virginia Power entered into an agreement to sell a \n50\n% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak through the formation of OSWP. In October 2024, Virginia Power and Stonepeak closed on the agreement following the receipt of consent by BOEM and satisfaction of other customary closing and regulatory conditions. Consistent with the terms of the agreement, Virginia Power contributed the CVOW Commercial Project and Stonepeak contributed cash to OSWP. The contribution of the CVOW Commercial Project required approvals from the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions, which were received in September 2024.  At closing, Virginia Power received $\n2.6\n billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, representing \n50\n% of the CVOW Commercial Project construction costs incurred through closing, less an initial withholding of $\n145\n million.  If the total project costs of the CVOW Commercial Project are $\n9.8\n billion, excluding financing costs, or less Virginia Power shall receive $\n100\n million of the initial withholding. Such amount is subject to downward adjustment with Virginia Power receiving no withheld amounts if the total costs, excluding financing costs, of the CVOW Commercial Project exceed $\n11.3\n billion.\n \n\n\n \n143\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power and Stonepeak will each contribute \n50\n% of the remaining capital necessary to fund construction of the CVOW Commercial Project provided the total project cost, excluding financing costs, is less than $\n11.3\n billion. For capital funding necessary, if any, for total project costs, excluding financing costs, of $\n11.3\n billion through $\n13.7\n billion, Stonepeak will have the option to make additional capital contributions. If Stonepeak elects to make additional capital contributions for project costs, excluding financing costs, in excess of $\n11.3\n billion, if any, Virginia Power shall contribute between \n67\n% and \n83\n% of such capital with Stonepeak contributing the remainder.  To the extent that Stonepeak elects not to make such contributions, Virginia Power shall receive an increase in its ownership percentage of OSWP for any contributed capital based on a tiered unit price for membership interests in OSWP as set forth in the agreement. Virginia Power and Stonepeak have the right to provide capital contributions for any total project costs, excluding financing costs, in excess of $\n13.7\n billion.\n \n \nOSWP is considered to be a VIE primarily because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Virginia Power is considered to be the primary beneficiary and consolidates OSWP with Stonepeak’s interests reflected as noncontrolling interests beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 as Virginia Power has the power to direct the most significant activities of OSWP, including construction and operation of the CVOW Commercial Project. In the event that OSWP ceases to be a VIE, Virginia Power expects to continue to consolidate OSWP as its ownership interest is expected to be considered a controlling financial interest over the entity through its rights to control operations.\nVirginia Power Easement Agreement\nIn November 2023, Virginia Power entered into an agreement to pay $\n65\n million for an easement related to the CVOW Commercial Project for which it will not seek recovery and therefore recorded a charge of $\n65\n million ($\n49\n million after-tax) within impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment).\nNonregulated Solar Projects\n \nThe following table presents acquisitions by Virginia Power of non-jurisdictional solar projects (reflected in Dominion Energy Virginia).

See Note 3 for discussion.\n(3)\nIn January 2023, Dominion Energy terminated its agreement, without penalty, to acquire Hardin II.\n(4)\nDominion Energy expects to claim production tax credits on the energy generated and sold by these projects.\nIn addition to the facilities discussed above, Dominion Energy has also entered into various agreements to install solar facilities (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment), primarily at schools in Virginia. As of December 31, 2024\n, Dominion Energy has in service solar facilities with an aggregate generation capacity of \n7\n MW at a cost of $\n16\n million and anticipates placing additional facilities in service by the end of \n2025\n with an estimated total projected cost of approximately $\n5\n million and an aggregate generation capacity of \n3\n MW. Dominion Energy has claimed or expects to claim federal investment tax credits on the projects.\nImpairment\nIn \nthe fourth quarter of 2022, Dominion Energy modified its intentions for the ongoing growth and development of its nonregulated solar generation assets as part of the preliminary stages of its comprehensive business review announced in November 2022. In connection with that determination, Dominion Energy expects that it is more likely than not that the nonregulated solar generation projects within Contracted Energy will be sold before the end of their useful lives and therefore evaluated the associated long-lived\n \n\n\n \n144\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nassets \nfor recoverability. Given their strategic alignment with Virginia Power’s operations, the non-jurisdictional solar generation projects reflected in Dominion Energy Virginia were not further evaluated for recoverability. Using a probability-weighted approach, Dominion Energy determined Contracted Energy’s nonregulated solar generation assets were impaired and recorded a charge of $\n908\n million ($\n685\n million after-tax) primarily in impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment) for the year ended December 31, 2022 to adjust the property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use lease assets down to an estimated fair value of $\n665\n million in aggregate. The fair value was estimated using an income approach. The valuation is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant judgmental and unobservable inputs, including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risks inherent in the future cash flows and market prices.\n \nAcquisition of Offshore Wind Project\nIn \nJuly 2024\n, Virginia Power entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately \n40,000\n-acre area lease \n27\n miles off the coast of North Carolina in federal waters and associated project assets in the early stages of development for approximately $\n160\n million. The transaction closed in \nOctober 2024\n following the receipt of approval from BOEM and other customary regulatory approvals. The CVOW South project, if constructed, is expected to have a generating capacity of \n800\n MW with ultimate development of the project dependent upon the receipt of approvals from the Virginia Commission and other permitting entities. The project would support Virginia Power’s ability to meet the renewable energy portfolio standards established in the VCEA.\nSales of Corporate Office Buildings\nIn 2023, Dominion Energy entered into an agreement for the sale of a corporate office building for total cash consideration of $\n40\n million. The corporate office building is reflected in the Corporate and Other segment and was presented as held for sale in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n17\n million ($\n12\n million after-tax) in impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust the corporate office building down to its estimated fair value, using a market approach, of $\n23\n million. The valuation is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement as it is based on unobservable inputs due to limited comparable market activity. In the third quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy entered into a new agreement to sell the corporate office building, which closed in December 2024 for $\n19\n million, and recorded an inconsequential loss upon closing.\nIn 2023, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n93\n million ($\n69\n million after-tax) in impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income to adjust a corporate office building down to its estimated fair value, using a market approach, of $\n35\n million. The valuation is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement as it is based on unobservable inputs due to limited comparable market activity. The corporate office building is reflected in the Corporate and Other segment and is presented as held for sale in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023. Dominion Energy completed the sale in July 2024.\nNonregulated Renewable Natural Gas Facilities\nDominion Energy recorded impairment charges of $\n33\n million ($\n25\n million after-tax) and $\n27\n million ($\n21\n million after-tax) in the second and third quarters of 2024, respectively, in impairment of assets and other charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income reflected in the Corporate and Other segment, to write down the long-lived assets of certain nonregulated renewable natural gas facilities under development to their estimated fair values which were each less than $\n1\n million. The fair values were estimated using an income approach. The valuations are considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant judgmental and unobservable inputs, including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risks inherent in future cash flows and market prices.\n \nSale of Utility Property\nIn 2023, Dominion Energy completed the sales of certain utility property in South Carolina, as approved by the South Carolina Commission in February 2023, for total cash consideration of $\n12\n million. In connection with the sales, Dominion Energy recognized a gain of $\n11\n million ($\n8\n million after-tax), recorded in losses (gains) on sales of assets, in its Consolidated Statements of Income (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn 2022, Dominion Energy completed the sales of certain utility property in South Carolina, as approved by the South Carolina Commission, for total cash consideration of $\n20\n million. In connection with the sales, Dominion Energy recognized a gain of $\n20\n million ($\n15\n million after-tax), recorded in losses (gains) on sales of assets, in its Consolidated Statements of Income (reflected in Dominion Energy South Carolina) for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n\n \n145\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTE \n11.

In 2023, Virginia Power recorded a charge of $\n36\n million ($\n27\n million after-tax), included in impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment), for the write-off of certain previously deferred amounts related to Riders R, S and W in connection with the cessation of such riders effective July 2023. See Note 13 for additional information.   \n(4)\nPrimarily reflects legislation in Virginia which requires any CCR asset located at certain Virginia Power stations to be closed by removing the CCR to an approved landfill or through beneficial reuse. These deferred costs are expected to be collected over a period between \n15\n and \n18 years\n commencing December \n2021\n through Rider CCR. Virginia Power is entitled to collect carrying costs on uncollected expenditures once expenditures have been made. In addition, the balance at December 31, 2024 reflects amounts related to the EPA’s May 2024 final rule concerning CCR as discussed in Note 14.\n(5)\nPrimarily reflects deferred operation and maintenance costs at Virginia Power incurred in connection with the refueling of any nuclear-powered generating plant as required by Virginia legislation.

Includes regulatory assets of $\n215\n million and regulatory liabilities of $\n12\n million in aggregate at December 31, 2023 related to retained pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations for the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions which were reclassified to into other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Income upon closing of each transaction.\n(9)\nReflects interest rate hedges recoverable from or refundable to customers. Certain of these instruments are settled and any related payments are being amortized into interest expense over the life of the related debt, which has a weighted-average useful life of approximately \n25\n years and \n24\n years for Dominion Energy and Virginia Power, respectively, as of December 31, 2024.\n(10)\nRepresents uncollected costs, including deferred depreciation and accretion expense, related to legal obligations associated with the future retirement of generation, transmission and distribution properties. The AROs primarily relate to DESC’s electric generating facilities, including Summer, and are expected to be recovered over the related property lives and periods of decommissioning which may range up to approximately \n105\n years.\n(11)\nRates charged to customers by Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s regulated businesses include a provision for the cost of future activities to remove assets that are expected to be incurred at the time of retirement. \n(12)\nReflects amounts previously collected from retail electric customers of DESC for the NND Project to be credited over an estimated \n11\n-year period effective February 2019, in connection with the SCANA Merger Approval Order.\n(13)\nAmounts recorded to pass the effect of reduced income taxes from the 2017 Tax Reform Act to customers in future periods, which will primarily reverse at the weighted-average tax rate that was used to build the reserves over the remaining book life of the property, net of amounts to be recovered through future rates to pay income taxes that become payable when rate revenue is provided to recover AFUDC equity.\n(14)\nReflects amounts to be refunded to DESC electric service customers over a \n20\n-year period ending in 2039 associated with the monetization of a bankruptcy settlement agreement. \n(15)\nPrimarily reflects a regulatory liability representing amounts collected from Virginia jurisdictional customers and placed in external trusts (including income, losses and changes in fair value thereon, as applicable) for the future decommissioning of Virginia Power’s utility nuclear generation stations, in excess of the related AROs.\n(16)\nReflects a regulatory liability for the collection of postretirement benefit costs allowed in rates in excess of expense incurred. \nAt December 31, 2024\n, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power regulatory assets include $\n6.1\n billion and $\n4.5\n billion, respectively, on which they do not expect to earn a return during the applicable recovery period. With the exception of certain items discussed above, the majority of these expenditures are expected to be recovered within the next \ntwo years\n.\n \n\n\nNOTE \n13. REGULATORY MATTERS\nRegulatory Matters Involving Potential Loss Contingencies\n \nAs \na result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, the Companies are involved in various regulatory matters. Certain regulatory matters may ultimately result in a loss; however, as such matters are in an initial procedural phase, involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending reviews or orders and/or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For regulatory matters that the Companies cannot estimate, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the regulatory process such that the Companies are able to estimate a range of possible loss. For regulatory matters that the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in excess of the accrued liability (if any) for such matters. Any estimated range is based on currently available information, involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties and may not represent the Companies’ maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such regulatory matters will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current matters not specifically reported below,\n \n\n\n \n148\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmanagement \ndoes not anticipate that the outcome from such matters would have a material effect on the Companies’ financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n \nOther Regulatory Matters\n \nVirginia Regulation \n–\n Key Legislation Affecting Operations\nRegulation Act and Grid Transformation and Security Act of 2018\nThe Regulation Act enacted in 2007 instituted a cost-of-service rate model that authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of costs for new generation projects, FERC-approved transmission costs, underground distribution lines, environmental compliance, conservation and energy efficiency programs, renewable energy programs and nuclear license renewals, and also contains statutory provisions directing Virginia Power to file annual fuel cost recovery cases with the Virginia Commission.\n \nIf the Virginia Commission’s future rate decisions, including actions relating to Virginia Power’s rate adjustment clause filings, differ materially from Virginia Power’s expectations, it may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n \nThe GTSA reinstated base rate reviews commencing with the 2021 Triennial Review. In the triennial review proceedings, earnings that were more than 70 basis points above the utility’s authorized ROE that might have been refunded to customers\n \nand served as the basis for a reduction in future rates, could be reduced by Virginia Commission-approved investment amounts in qualifying solar or wind generation facilities or electric distribution grid transformation projects that Virginia Power elected to include in a CCRO. The legislation declared that electric distribution grid transformation projects are in the public interest and provided that the costs of such projects may be recovered through a rate adjustment clause if not the subject of a CCRO. Any costs that were the subject of a CCRO were deemed recovered in base rates during the triennial period under review and could not be included in base rates in future triennial review proceedings. In any triennial review in which the Virginia Commission determined that the utility’s earnings were more than 70 basis points above its authorized ROE, base rates were subject to reduction prospectively and customer refunds would be due unless the total CCRO elected by the utility equaled or exceeded the amount of earnings in excess of the 70 basis points. For the purposes of measuring \nany customer refunds or CCRO amounts utilized under the GTSA, associated income taxes were factored into the determination of such amounts. In the 2021 Triennial Review, any such rate reduction was limited to $\n50\n million. This section of the GTSA concerning base rate reviews was amended by 2023 legislation as discussed below.\nVirginia 2020 Legislation\nIn April 2020, the Governor of Virginia signed into law the VCEA, which along with related legislation forms a comprehensive framework affecting Virginia Power’s operations.  The VCEA replaces Virginia’s voluntary renewable energy portfolio standard for Virginia Power with a mandatory program setting annual renewable energy portfolio standard requirements based on the percentage of total electric energy sold by Virginia Power, excluding existing nuclear generation and certain new carbon-free resources, reaching \n100\n% by the end of 2045. The VCEA includes related requirements concerning deployment of wind, solar and energy storage resources, as well as provides for certain measures to increase net-metering, including an allocation for low-income customers, incentivizes energy efficiency programs and provides for cost recovery related \nto participation\n in a carbon trading program. While the legislation affects several portions of Virginia Power’s operations, key provisions of the GTSA remained in effect, including the triennial review structure and timing, the use of the CCRO and the $\n50\n million cap on revenue reductions in the first triennial review proceeding. Key provisions of the VCEA and related legislation passed include the follo\nwing:\n•\nFossil\n \nFuel Electric Generation\n:  The legislation mandates Chesterfield Power Station Units 5 & 6 and Yorktown Power Station Unit 3 to be retired by the end of 2024, Altavista, Southampton and Hopewell to be retired by the end of 2028 and Virginia Power’s remaining fossil fuel units to be retired by the end of 2045, unless the retirement of such generating units will compromise grid reliability or security. In addition, the Virginia Commission shall determine the amortization period for recovery of any appropriate costs due to the early retirement of any electric generation facilities. Virginia Power revised the depreciable lives of Altavista, Southampton and Hopewell for the mandated retirement to the end of 2028, which did not have a material impact to Virginia Power’s results of operations or cash flows given the existing regulatory framework. This section of the VCEA concerning mandatory retirements of certain facilities by the end of 2028 was amended by 2023 legislation as discussed below. As a result, in November 2023 Virginia Power revised the depreciable lives of Altavista, Southampton and Hopewell and implemented useful life assumptions that were effective before the previous revision.\n•\nRenewable Generation:\n The legislation provides a detailed renewable energy portfolio standard to achieve 100% zero-carbon generation by the end of 2045, excluding existing nuclear generation and certain new carbon-free resources. Components include requirements to petition the Virginia Commission for approval to construct or acquire new generating capacity to reach \n16.1\n GW of installed solar and onshore wind by the end of 2035, which includes specific requirements for utility-scale solar of \n3.0\n GW by the end of 2024, up to \n15.0\n GW by the end of 2035 and \n1.1\n GW of small-scale solar by the end of 2035. The legislation deems \n2.7\n GW of energy storage, including up to \n800\n MW for any one project which may include a pumped storage facility, by the end of 2035 to be in the public interest. The legislation also deems the construction or purchase of an offshore wind facility constructed off the Virginia coast with a capacity of up to \n5.2\n GW \nbefore 2035 to be in the public \n\n\n \n149\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ninterest \nand provides certain presumptions facilitating cost recovery. The costs of such a facility constructed by the utility with a capacity between \n2.5\n and \n3.0\n GW will be presumed reasonably and prudently incurred if the Virginia Commission finds that the project meets competitive procurement requirements, the projected cost of the facility does not exceed a specified industry benchmark and the utility commences construction by the end of 2023 or has a plan for the facility to be in service by the end of 2027. Projects to meet these requirements are subject to approval by the Virginia Commission.\n•\nEnergy Efficiency:\n \nThe legislation includes an energy efficiency target of \n5\n% energy savings, as measured from a 2019 baseline, through verifiable energy efficiency programs by the end of 2025 with future targets to be set by the Virginia Commission. Virginia Power has the opportunity to offset the lost revenues with margins on program spend if certain targets are achieved and can also seek recovery of the lost revenues associated with energy efficiency programs if such reductions are found to have caused Virginia Power to earn more than 50 basis points below a fair rate of return on its rates for generation and distribution services.\n•\nCarbon trading program\n:  The legislation authorizes Virginia to participate in a market-based carbon trading program consistent with RGGI through 2050. In January 2022, the Governor of Virginia issued an executive order which put directives in place to start administrative steps to withdraw Virginia from RGGI. In December 2023, the withdrawal took effect, which remains subject to ongoing legal challenges. All costs of the carbon trading program are recoverable through an environmental rider.\n•\nLow-income customers\n:  The legislation includes the establishment of a percentage of income payment program to be administered by the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development and the Virginia Department of Social Services.  To fund the program, Virginia Power will remit amounts collected from customers under a universal service fee established and set by the Virginia Commission. As such, this program will not affect Virginia Power’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows\n. In December 2020, the Virginia Commission issued a final order confirming a revenue requirement of $\n93\n million related to this program. Implementation details and the effective date of the program would be established in future legislation prior to collection of fees from customers. In October 2023, the Virginia Commission approved the collection by Virginia Power of a universal service fee of $\n71\n million from customers during the rate year beginning November 2023, including \nthe impact on certain non-jurisdictional customers which follow Virginia Power’s jurisdictional customer rate methodology.\nVirginia 2023 Legislation\n \nIn April 2023, legislation was enacted that amended several key provisions of the Regulation Act, as previously amended by the GTSA, and revised portions of the existing regulatory framework affecting Virginia Power’s operations.\n \nThe legislation resets the frequency of base rate reviews from a triennial period, as established under the GTSA, to a biennial period commencing with the 2023 Biennial Review. Such biennial reviews shall include the establishment of an authorized ROE to be utilized for base rates and riders, prospective base rates for the upcoming two-year period based on projected cost of service and a determination by the Virginia Commission as to Virginia Power’s base rate earned return for the most recently completed two-year period against the previously authorized ROE, including any potential credits to customers’ bills.\nThe legislation provides that the Virginia Commission will establish an authorized ROE of \n9.70\n% for Virginia Power in the 2023 Biennial Review, reflecting the average authorized ROE of vertically integrated electric utilities by the applicable regulatory commissions in the peer group jurisdictions of Florida, Georgia, Texas, Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina. Subsequent to the 2023 Biennial Review, all provisions related to this peer group benchmarking expire and the Virginia Commission is authorized to utilize any methodology it deems to be consistent with the public interest to make future ROE determinations. In all future biennial reviews, if the Virginia Commission determines that Virginia Power’s existing base rates will, on a going-forward basis, produce revenues that are either in excess of or below its authorized rate of return, the Virginia Commission is authorized to reduce or increase such base rates, as applicable and necessary, to ensure that Virginia Power’s base rates are just and reasonable while still allowing Virginia Power to recover its costs and earn a fair rate of return. In addition, beginning with the biennial review to be filed in 2025, the Virginia Commission may, at its discretion, increase or decrease Virginia Power’s authorized ROE by up to 50 basis points based on factors that may include reliability, generating plant performance, customer service and operating efficiency, with the provisions applying to such adjustments to be determined in a future proceeding.\n \nThe legislation directs that if the Virginia Commission determines as part of the 2023 Biennial Review that Virginia Power has earned more than \n70\n basis points above its authorized ROE of \n9.35\n% established in the 2021 Triennial Review that \n85\n% of the amount of such earnings above this level be credited to customers’ bills. In future biennial reviews, beginning with the biennial review to be filed in 2025, \n85\n% of any earnings determined by the Virginia Commission to be up to \n150\n basis points above Virginia Power’s authorized ROE shall be credited to customers’ bills as well as \n100\n% of any earnings that are more than \n150\n basis \npoints above Virginia Power’s authorized ROE. For the purposes of measuring any bill credits due to customers, associated income taxes are factored into the determination of such amounts. In addition, the legislation eliminates Virginia Power’s ability to utilize Virginia\n \n\n\n \n150\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCommission-approved \ninvestment amounts in qualifying solar or wind generation facilities or electric distribution grid transformation projects as a CCRO to reduce or offset any earnings otherwise eligible for customer credits as previously permitted under the GTSA.\n \nIn addition to the biennial review mechanisms discussed above, the legislation also includes provisions related to other aspects of Virginia Power’s ratemaking framework.\n•\nRiders into base rates\n: Virginia Power is required to combine certain riders with an aggregate annual revenue requirement of at least $\n350\n million with its base rates effective July 2023. After such riders are combined, they will be considered as part of base rates for the purposes of the biennial review proceedings. The inclusion of such riders cannot serve as the basis for an increase in base rates as part of the 2023 Biennial Review. \n•\nRider consolidation\n: Upon determination by the Virginia Commission, certain riders, while remaining separate from base rates, may be consolidated for cost recovery and review purposes. \n•\nCapitalization ratio\n: The legislation establishes that Virginia Power is required to undertake reasonable efforts to maintain a common equity capitalization to total capitalization ratio through December 2024 of \n52.10\n%. \n•\nFuel cost securitization\n: Virginia Power is authorized, on or before July 2024, to petition the Virginia Commission for approval of a financing order for certain deferred fuel costs. Virginia Power is required to permit certain retail customers to opt out of any such deferred fuel cost securitization. \n•\nElectric generation plant retirements\n: The Virginia Commission shall provide to the Virginia General Assembly, on an annual basis, a report that includes information concerning the reliability impacts of generation unit additions and retirement determinations, along with the potential impact on the purchase of power from generation assets outside of the Virginia jurisdiction, the result of which could impact the depreciable lives of Virginia Power’s electric generation facilities in future periods. \nIn addition, in May 2023 legislation was enacted that amended certain portions of the VCEA to qualify generation produced by Virginia Power’s biomass electric generating stations as renewable energy and eliminate the mandated retirement of such facilities by the end of 2028.\nVirginia Power is incurring and expects to incur significant costs, including capital expenditures, to comply with the legislative requirements discussed above. The legislation allows for cost recovery under the existing or modified regulatory framework through rate adjustment clauses, rates for generation and distribution services or Virginia Power’s fuel factor, as approved by the Virginia Commission. Costs allocated to the North Carolina jurisdiction will be recovered, subject to approval by the North Carolina Commission, in accordance with the existing regulatory framework.\nVirginia Regulation – Key Developments\n2023 Biennial Review\n \nIn July 2023, Virginia Power filed its base rate case and accompanying schedules in support of the 2023 Biennial Review in accordance with legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023 as discussed above. Virginia Power’s earnings test analysis, as filed, demonstrated it earned a combined ROE of \n9.04\n% on its generation and distribution services for the test period, within 70 basis points of its authorized ROE of \n9.35\n% established in the 2021 Triennial Review. Virginia Power did not request an increase in base rates for generation and distribution services and proposed that base rates remain at their existing level utilizing an ROE of \n9.70\n% for the prospective test periods and a common equity capitalization to total capitalization ratio of \n52.10\n%. Virginia Power noted that while its prospective test periods would result in a revenue deficiency, it did not request an increase to base rates given that the combination of certain riders with an aggregate annual revenue requirement of at least $\n350\n million into base rates effective July 2023 cannot serve as the basis for an increase in base rates as part of the 2023 Biennial Review.\n \nIn November 2023, Virginia Power, the Virginia Commission staff and other parties filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the Virginia Commission for approval. The comprehensive settlement agreement indicates that Virginia Power demonstrated it earned a combined ROE of \n9.05\n% on its generation and distribution services for the test period, requires previously unrecovered severe weather event costs of $\n45\n million to be recovered through base rates during the 2023-2024 biennial period, with carrying costs, and provides for $\n15\n million in one-time credits to customers by September 2024.\nIn February 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the comprehensive settlement agreement and issued its order in this matter. In doing so, the Virginia Commission determined that Virginia Power’s earnings for the test period, considered as a whole, were within \n70\n basis points above or below its authorized ROE of \n9.35\n%. The Virginia Commission also authorized an ROE of \n9.70\n%, as directed by legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023, for Virginia Power that will be applied to Virginia Power’s riders prospectively and that will also be utilized to measure base rate earnings for the 2025 Biennial Review. In connection with the order, Virginia Power recorded a net benefit of $\n17\n million ($\n12\n million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2024 within impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment) for a regulatory asset for previously unrecovered severe weather event costs, which were amortized by the end of 2024.\n\n\n \n151\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Fuel Expenses\n \nIn May 2023, Virginia Power filed its annual fuel factor filing with the Virginia Commission to recover an estimated $\n2.3\n billion in Virginia jurisdictional projected fuel expense for the rate year beginning \nJuly 1, 2023\n and a projected $\n1.3\n billion under-recovered balance as of June 30, 2023. Virginia Power proposed two alternatives to recover these under-collected fuel costs, including an option based on an anticipated securitization of up to $\n1.3\n billion under-recovered balance as of June 30, 2023 as permitted under legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023, with such securitization approved by the Virginia Commission in November 2023 and completed by Virginia Power in February 2024. In March 2024, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power’s annual fuel factor based on the securitization option, which results in a net decrease in Virginia Power’s fuel revenues for the rate year of approximately $\n541\n million. In addition, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power’s proposal to alter the order in which revenue from certain customers who elect to pay market-based rates would be allocated between base rates and fuel, which results in a reduction to fuel revenue of $\n13\n million.\n \nIn May 2024, Virginia Power filed its annual fuel factor with the Virginia Commission to recover an estimated $\n2.2\n billion in Virginia jurisdictional projected fuel expenses for the rate year beginning \nJuly 1, 2024\n and to return an estimated $\n266\n million net over-recovered balance through June 30, 2024. Virginia Power’s proposed fuel rate represents a fuel revenue decrease of $\n636\n million when applied to projected kilowatt-hour sales for the rate year beginning July 1, 2024. In May 2024, the Virginia Commission ordered that Virginia Power’s proposed total fuel factor rate be placed into effect on an interim basis for usage on and after July 1, 2024. In January 2025, the Virginia Commission approved the filing.\nRenewable Generation Projects\nIn October 2023, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission for CPCNs to construct or acquire and operate \nfour\n utility-scale projects totaling approximately \n329\n MW of solar generation as part of its efforts to meet the renewable generation development targets under the VCEA. The projects, as of October 2023, are expected to cost approximately $\n850\n million in the aggregate, excluding financing costs, and be placed into service between 2024 and 2026. In March 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the petition.\nIn October 2024, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission for CPCNs to construct or acquire and operate two utility-scale projects totaling approximately \n208\n MW of solar generation as part of its efforts to meet the renewable generation development targets under the VCEA. The projects, as of October 2024, are expected to cost approximately $\n605\n million in the aggregate, excluding financing costs, and be placed into service between 2026 and 2028. This matter is pending.\nVirginia LNG Storage Facility\n \nIn June 2024, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission to amend the CPCNs for Brunswick County and Greensville County to construct and operate an LNG production, storage and regasification facility and related transmission facilities adjacent to Greensville County. When complete, the facility will store the liquefied equivalent of approximately \n2.0\n bcf and would be able to regasify approximately \n25\n% of its storage capacity per day and liquefy from the pipeline less than \n1\n% of its equivalent storage capacity per day. The facility will serve as a backup fuel source for Brunswick County and Greensville County to support operations and improve system reliability. The facility is expected to cost approximately $\n550\n million, excluding financing costs, and be placed into service by the end of 2027. In February 2025, the Virginia Commission approved the petition.\n\n\n \n152\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRiders\nSignificant riders associated with various Virginia Power projects are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider Name\n\n\n \n\n\nApplication Date\n\n\n \n\n\nApproval Date\n\n\n \n\n\nRate Year \nBeginning\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal Revenue Requirement (millions)\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIncrease (Decrease) Over Previous Year (millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider BW\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 2021\n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2022\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n120\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n25\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider CCR\n\n\n \n\n\nMarch 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nNovember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n103\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n91\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider CE\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nMarch 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n133\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider CE\n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nPending\n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n182\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider DIST\n(5)\n\n\n \n\n\nAugust 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nPending\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n269\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN/A\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider E\n\n\n \n\n\nJanuary 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nNovember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n72\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n37\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider E\n\n\n \n\n\nJanuary 2025\n\n\n \n\n\nPending\n\n\n \n\n\nNovember 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n35\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider GEN\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nPending\n\n\n \n\n\nApril 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n438\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN/A\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider GEN\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nPending\n\n\n \n\n\nApril 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n311\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n127\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider GT\n(5)\n\n\n \n\n\nAugust 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n145\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n131\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider GV\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nFebruary 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nApril 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n132\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider GV\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nFebruary 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nApril 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n135\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider OSW\n\n\n \n\n\nNovember 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nJuly 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n486\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n215\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider OSW\n(6)\n\n\n \n\n\nNovember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nPending\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n640\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n154\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider RPS\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 2023\n(12)\n\n\n \n\n\nAugust 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n358\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n262\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider RPS\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nPending\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n609\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n251\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider SNA\n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n69\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider SNA\n(7)\n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nPending\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n207\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n138\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider T1\n(8)\n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nJuly 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,170\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n291\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider U\n(5)(9)\n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nJuly 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nAugust 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n150\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n76\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDSM Riders\n(10)\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nJuly 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n86\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n21\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDSM Riders\n(11)\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 2024\n\n\n \n\n\nPending\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n97\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nIn addition, Virginia \nPower has various riders associated with other projects with an aggregate total annual revenue requirement of approximately $\n18\n million as of December 31, 2024.

applicable. In addition, Virginia Power had various other transmission projects approved during 2024 and early 2025 or applied for and currently pending approval with aggregate cost estimates of approximately $\n145\n million and $\n65\n million, respectively.\nIn November 2013, the Virginia Commission issued an order granting Virginia Power a CPCN to construct approximately \n7\n miles of new overhead \n500\n kV \ntransmission line from the existing Surry switching station in Surry County to a new Skiffes Creek switching\n \n\n\n \n154\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nstation \nin James City County, and approximately \n20\n miles of new \n230\n kV transmission line in James City County, York County and the City of Newport News from the proposed new Skiffes Creek switching station to Virginia Power’s existing Whealton substation in the City of Hampton. In February 2019, the transmission line project was placed into service. In March 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an order vacating the permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued in July 2017 and ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to do a full environmental impact study of the project. In April 2019, Virginia Power and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers filed petitions for rehearing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, asking that the permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers remain in effect while an environmental impact study is performed.  In May 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied the request for rehearing and ordered the U.S. District Court for the D.C. Circuit to consider and issue a ruling on whether the permit should be vacated during the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ preparation of an environmental impact statement. In November 2019, the U.S. District Court for the D.C. Circuit issued an order allowing the permit to remain in effect while an environmental impact statement is prepared. In November 2020, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a draft environmental impact statement noting there is no better alternative. This matter is pending.\nVirginia Regulation – Key Developments Affecting 2022\nVirginia Fuel Expenses\n \nIn May 2022, Virginia Power filed its annual fuel factor filing with the Virginia Commission to recover an estimated $\n2.3\n billion in Virginia jurisdictional projected fuel expense for the rate year beginning \nJuly 1, 2022\n and a projected $\n1.0\n billion under-recovered balance as of June 30, 2022. Virginia Power’s proposed fuel rate represents a fuel revenue increase of $\n1.8\n billion when applied to projected kilowatt-hour sales for that period. Virginia Power also proposed alternatives to recover this under-collected balance over a two- or three-year period. Under these alternatives, Virginia Power’s fuel revenues for the rate year would increase by $\n1.3\n billion or $\n1.2\n billion, respectively. In addition, Virginia Power proposed a change in the timing of fuel cost recovery for certain customers who elect market-based rates that would consider those customers’ portion of the projected under-recovered balance to have been recovered as of June 30, 2022. In July 2022, Virginia Power, the Virginia Commission staff and another party filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the Virginia Commission for approval. The comprehensive settlement agreement provides for the collection of the requested under-recovered projected fuel expense over a \nthree-year\n period beginning \nJuly 1, 2022\n and that Virginia Power will exclude from recovery through base rates one half of the related financing costs over the \nthree-year\n period. In addition, the proposed settlement agreement affirmed Virginia Power’s proposal regarding fuel cost recovery for market-based rate customers. As a result, Virginia Power recorded a $\n191\n million ($\n142\n million after-tax) charge in the second quarter of 2022 within impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statement of Income (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment). In September 2022, the Virginia Commission approved the comprehensive settlement agreement.\nRider RGGI\nIn May 2022, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission requesting suspension of Rider RGGI approved in August 2021. Virginia Power also requested that RGGI compliance costs incurred and unrecovered through July 2022 be recovered through existing base rates in effect during the period incurred. The Virginia Commission approved the request in June 2022. In the second quarter of 2022, Virginia Power recorded a charge of $\n180\n million ($\n134\n million after-tax) in impairment of assets and other charges (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment) for the amount deemed recovered through base rates through June 30, 2022, including the impact of certain non-jurisdictional customers which follow Virginia Power’s jurisdictional rate methodology. Virginia Power recorded $\n33\n million ($\n25\n million after-tax) in depreciation and amortization in the third quarter of 2022.\nNorth Carolina Regulation\nVirginia Power Base Rate Case\nIn March 2024, Virginia Power filed its base rate case and schedules with the North Carolina Commission. Virginia Power proposed a non-fuel, base rate increase of $\n57\n million effective November 1, 2024 on an interim basis subject to refund, with any permanent rates ordered by the North Carolina Commission effective February 1, 2025. The base rate increase was proposed to recover the significant investments in generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure for the benefit of North Carolina customers. Virginia Power presented an earned return of \n5.01\n% based upon a fully-adjusted test period, compared to its authorized \n9.75\n% return, and proposed a \n10.60\n% ROE.\nIn October 2024, Virginia Power, the North Carolina public staff and other parties of record filed a settlement agreement with the North Carolina Commission for approval. The settlement agreement provides for a non-fuel, base rate increase of $\n37\n million effective November 1, 2024 on an interim basis subject to refund, with any permanent rates ordered by the North Carolina Commission effective February 1, 2025, and an authorized ROE of \n9.95\n%. \nIn addition, the settlement agreement provides that Virginia Power may file with the North Carolina Commission an application for an annual rider to seek recovery of incurred North Carolina jurisdictional CCR expenses, with the first such rider, if approved by the North Carolina Commission, covering costs for the period July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. In January 2025, the North Carolina Commission approved the settlement agreement.\n \n\n\n \n155\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn \nFebruary 2025, the North Carolina Commission approved Virginia Power’s request to recover $\n6\n million in CCR expenses through a CCR rider on an interim basis, with rates effective March 2025.\nVirginia Power Fuel Filing\nIn August 2024, Virginia Power submitted its annual filing to the North Carolina Commission to adjust the fuel component of its electric rates. As subsequently updated in October 2024, Virginia Power proposed a total $\n107\n million decrease to the fuel component of its electric rates for the rate year beginning February 1, 2025. In addition, Virginia Power proposed the implementation of a three-month decrement rider effective November 1, 2024 to reduce the over-recovery of the fuel component of its electric rates during the current rate year. In January 2025, the North Carolina Commission approved the filing.\nPSNC Customer Usage Tracker\nPSNC utilizes a customer usage tracker, a decoupling mechanism, which allows it to adjust its base rates semi-annually for residential and commercial customers based on average per customer consumption. In \nMarch 2024\n, PSNC submitted a filing with the North Carolina Commission for a $\n31\n million decrease relating to the customer usage tracker. The North Carolina Commission approved the filing in March 2024 with rates effective April 2024.\nSouth Carolina Regulation\nElectric Base Rate Case\nIn March 2024, DESC filed its retail electric base rate case and schedules with the South Carolina Commission. DESC proposed a non-fuel, base rate increase of $\n295\n million, partially offset by a net decrease in storm damage and DSM components of $\n4\n million. If approved, the overall proposed rate increase of $\n291\n million, or \n12.59\n%, would be effective on and after the first billing cycle of September 2024. The base rate increase was proposed to recover the significant investment in assets and operating resources required to serve an expanding customer base, maintain the safety, reliability and efficiency of DESC’s system and meet increasingly stringent reliability, security and environmental requirements for the benefit of South Carolina customers. DESC presented an earned ROE of \n4.32\n% based upon a fully-adjusted test period. The proposed rates would provide for an earned ROE of \n10.60\n% compared to the currently authorized ROE of \n9.50\n%.\nIn July 2024, DESC, the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and other parties of record filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the South Carolina Commission for approval. The comprehensive settlement agreement provides for a non-fuel, base rate increase of $\n219\n million prior to the effect of South Carolina Commission-ordered DSM reductions commencing with service rendered on September 1, 2024 and an authorized ROE of \n9.94\n%. In addition, the comprehensive settlement agreement includes that DESC would provide a one-time bill credit in 2024 of approximately $\n7\n million primarily to residential customers. In August 2024, the South Carolina Commission voted to approve the settlement agreement.\n \nIn connection with this matter, in the third quarter of 2024 Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n58\n million ($\n44\n million after tax) (reflected within the Corporate and Other segment), including $\n50\n million to write down certain materials and supplies inventory presented within impairment of assets and other charges.\nCost of Fuel\nDESC’s retail electric rates include a cost of fuel component approved by the South Carolina Commission which may be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the price of fuel purchased by DESC. In \nFebruary 2024\n, DESC filed with the South Carolina Commission a proposal to decrease the total fuel cost component of retail electric rates. DESC’s proposed adjustment is designed to recover DESC’s current base fuel costs, including its existing under-collected balance, over the 12-month period beginning with the first billing cycle of\n May 2024\n. In addition, DESC proposed an increase to its variable environmental and avoided capacity cost component. The net effect is a proposed annual decrease of $\n315\n million. In March 2024, DESC, the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and another party of record filed a settlement agreement with the South Carolina Commission for approval to make certain adjustments to the February 2024 filing that would result in a net annual decrease of $\n316\n million. In April 2024, the South Carolina Commission voted to approve the settlement agreement, with rates effective May 2024.\nIn February 2025, DESC filed with the South Carolina Commission a proposal to increase the total fuel cost component of retail electric rates. DESC’s proposed adjustment is designed to recover DESC’s current base fuel costs, including its existing under-collected balance, over the 12-month period beginning with the first billing cycle of May 2025. In addition, DESC proposed an increase to its variable environmental and avoided capacity cost component. The net effect is a proposed annual increase of $\n154\n million. This matter is pending.\nElectric DSM Programs\nDESC has approval for a DSM rider through which it recovers expenditures related to its electric DSM programs. In January 2024, DESC filed an application with the South Carolina Commission seeking approval to recover $\n47\n million \nof costs and net lost revenues associated with these programs, along with an incentive to invest in such programs. DESC requested that rates be effective with the\n \n\n\n \n156\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nfirst \nbilling cycle of May 2024. In April 2024, the South Carolina Commission approved the request, effective with the first billing cycle of May 2024.\nIn January 2025, DESC filed an application with the South Carolina Commission seeking approval to recover $\n46\n million of costs and net lost revenues associated with these programs, along with an incentive to invest in such programs. DESC requested that rates be effective with the first billing cycle of May 2025. This matter is pending.\nElectric - Transmission Projects\nIn \nMarch 2024\n, DESC filed an application with the South Carolina Commission requesting approval of a CPCN to construct and operate the Church Creek - Charleston Transmission Line, comprised of a \n7\n-mile \n230\n kV transmission line and associated facilities in Charleston County, South Carolina with an estimated total project cost of $\n40\n million. In July 2024, the South Carolina Commission approved the application.\nIn \nDecember 2024\n, DESC filed an application with the South Carolina Commission requesting approval of a CPCN to construct and operate the Ritter - Yemassee Transmission Line #2, comprised of a \n17\n-mile \n230\n kV transmission line and associated facilities in Colleton and Hampton Counties, South Carolina with an estimated total project cost of $\n55\n million. This matter is pending.\n\n\nNOTE \n14. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nAROs represent obligations that result from laws, statutes, contracts and regulations related to the eventual retirement of certain of the Companies’ long-lived assets. The Companies’ AROs are primarily associated with the decommissioning of their nuclear generation facilities, ash pond and landfill closures and CCR remediation.\nThe Companies have also identified, but not recognized, AROs related to the retirement of certain electric transmission and distribution assets located on property with easements, rights of way, franchises and lease agreements, Virginia Power’s hydroelectric generation facilities and the abatement of certain asbestos not expected to be disturbed in the Companies’ generation facilities. The Companies currently do not have sufficient information to estimate a reasonable range of expected retirement dates for any of these assets since the economic lives of these assets can be extended indefinitely through regular repair and maintenance and they currently have no plans to retire or dispose of any of these assets. As a result, a settlement date is not determinable for these assets and AROs for these assets will not be reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements until sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the activities to be performed. The Companies continue to monitor operational and strategic developments to identify if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate a retirement date for these assets.\n \nThe changes to AROs during \n2023 and 2024 were as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAROs at December 31, 2022\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,427\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,093\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nObligations incurred during the period\n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nObligations settled during the period\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n193\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n169\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevisions in estimated cash flows\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n603\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n564\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccretion\n\n\n \n\n\n222\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n156\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAROs at December 31, 2023\n(2)\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,075\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,653\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nObligations incurred during the period\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n1,126\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n469\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nObligations settled during the period\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n347\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n259\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevisions in estimated cash flows\n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\n300\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n342\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccretion\n\n\n \n\n\n272\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n192\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAROs at December 31, 2024\n(2)\n\n\n$\n\n\n7,426\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,397\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nPrimarily reflects revisions to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities at Virginia Power as discussed below. In addition, Dominion Energy recorded a $\n48\n million increase to its AROs to reflect a revision in the estimated cash flows following the approval of closure plans for a DESC generation facility previously taken out of service. Dominion Energy also recorded a decrease of $\n125\n million to its AROs due to a revision in the timing of expected cash flows associated with the expected approval of a \n20-year\n useful life extension of Millstone Units 2 and 3. Concurrently, Dominion Energy reevaluated its estimated cash flows associated with Millstone Unit 1, which resulted in an increase to its AROs of $\n83\n million. As a result, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n83\n million ($\n60\n million after-tax) within impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment).\n(2)\nIncludes $\n434\n million and $\n352\n million reported in other current liabilities for Dominion Energy at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. \n(3)\nPrimarily reflects AROs related to CCR remediation as discussed below.\n \n(4)\nPrimarily reflects revisions for increased costs related to the completion of nuclear decommissioning cost studies for Millstone, Surry and North Anna inclusive of a charge of $\n122\n million ($\n89\n million after-tax) within impairment of assets and other charges in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment). In addition, there were downward revisions for CCR remediation costs at Dominion Energy and future ash pond and landfill closure costs of certain electric generation facilities at Virginia Power. \n\n\n \n157\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy’s AROs at December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, include $\n2.6\n billion and $\n1.9\n billion, respectively, with $\n1.4\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion recorded by Virginia Power, related to the future decommissioning of their nuclear facilities. The Companies have established trusts dedicated to funding the future decommissioning activities. At December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, the aggregate fair value of Dominion Energy’s trusts, consisting primarily of equity and debt securities, totaled $\n8.1\n billion and $\n6.9\n billion, respectively. At December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, the aggregate fair value of Virginia Power’s trusts, consisting primarily of debt and equity securities, totaled $\n4.3\n billion and $\n3.7\n billion, respectively.\n \nAROs at December 31, 2024 also include $\n828\n million, with $\n404\n million recorded at Virginia Power, related to Dominion Energy’s CCR remediation activities. In May 2024, the EPA released a final rule to regulate inactive surface impoundments located at retired generating stations that contained CCR and liquids after October 2015, and certain other inactive or previously closed surface impoundments, landfills or other areas that contain accumulations of CCR. Dominion Energy believes that it may have inactive or closed units or areas that could be subject to the final rule at up to \n19\n different stations, including \n12\n at Virginia Power. In connection with this rule, in 2024, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power recorded an increase to their ARO\ns of $\n1.1\n billion and $\n420\n million, respectively, with a corresponding increase of $\n536\n million and $\n234\n million, respectively, to regulatory assets for amounts recoverable through retail electric rates, including riders, for electric generation stations that have been retired, $\n505\n million and $\n152\n million, respectively, to property, plant and equipment for amounts recoverable for electric generation stations that are currently in service and $\n34\n million to other deferred charges and other assets for amounts associated with nonjurisdictional customers at Virginia Power. Subsequently in 2024, Dominion Energy recorded an adjustment to decrease the ARO and related property, plant and equipment by $\n215\n million \nto reflect updated information concerning one facility. The actual AROs related to CCRs may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the obligation.\n \nIn addition, AROs at December 31, 2024 and 2023 include $\n3.2\n billion and $\n3.4\n billion, respectively, related to Virginia Power’s future ash pond and landfill closure costs. In 2024, Virginia Power revised its estimated cash flow projections associated with ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain of its utility generation facilities attributable to changes in the scheduling of certain projects and as a result recorded a decrease to its AROs of $\n64\n million with a corresponding decrease of $\n56\n million to regulatory assets for amounts recoverable through riders and $\n8\n million to other deferred charges and other assets for amounts associated with nonjurisdictional customers. In 2023, Virginia Power revised its estimated cash flow projections associated with ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain of its utility generation facilities in connection with obtaining replacement contracts for certain services following the bankruptcy of a previous vendor along with general updates of the contractual rates. As a result, Virginia Power recorded an increase to its AROs of $\n552\n million with a corresponding increase of $\n471\n million to regulatory assets for amounts recoverable through riders and $\n81\n million to other deferred charges and other assets for amounts associated with nonjurisdictional customers. Regulatory mechanisms, primarily associated with legislation enacted in Virginia in 2019, provide for recovery of costs to be incurred. See Note 12 for additional information.\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTE \n15.

2020, Dominion Energy signed an agreement (most recently amended in August 2024) with a lessor to complete construction of and lease a Jones Act compliant offshore wind installation vessel. This vessel is designed to handle current turbine technologies as well as next generation turbines. The lessor is providing equity and has obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling $\n715\n million, to fund the estimated project costs. The completed project is expected to be delivered to the CVOW Commercial Project in the third quarter of 2025. Dominion Energy has been appointed to act as the construction agent for the lessor, during which time Dominion Energy will request cash draws from the lessor and debt investors to fund all project costs, which totaled $\n598\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n. If the project is terminated under certain events of default, Dominion Energy could be required to pay up to \n100\n% of the then funded amount.\n \n \nThe initial lease term will commence once construction is substantially complete and the vessel is delivered and will mature after \nfive years\n. \nAt the end of the initial lease term, Dominion Energy can (i) extend the term of the lease for an additional term, subject to the approval of the participants, at current market terms, (ii) purchase the property for an amount equal to the outstanding project costs, or (iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property on behalf of the lessor to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest cash purchase price for the property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors for the outstanding project costs, Dominion Energy may be required to make a payment to the lessor for the difference between the outstanding project costs and sale proceeds. Dominion Energy is not considered the owner during construction for financial accounting purposes and, therefore, will not reflect the construction activity in its consolidated financial statements. Dominion Energy expects to recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding finance lease liability at the commencement of the\n \n\n\n \n160\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlease \nterm. Dominion Energy will be considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes, and as a result, will be entitled to tax deductions for depreciation and interest expense.\n \n\n\nNOTE \n16. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\n \nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE and to disclose certain information about its significant variable interests in the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both 1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n \nDominion Energy\n \nAt December 31, 2024\n, Dominion Energy owns a \n53\n% membership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Dominion Energy concluded that Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a VIE because it has insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. Dominion Energy has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of Atlantic Coast Pipeline as it does not have the power to direct the activities of Atlantic Coast Pipeline that most significantly impact its economic performance, as the power to direct is shared with Duke Energy. Dominion Energy is obligated to provide capital contributions based on its ownership percentage. Dominion Energy’s maximum exposure to loss is limited to any future investment. See Note \n9 for additional details regarding the nature of this entity.\n \nDominion Energy and Virginia Power\n \nThe Companies’ nuclear decommissioning trust funds and Dominion Energy’s rabbi trusts hold investments in limited partnerships or similar type entities, as discussed in Note 9. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power concluded that these partnership investments are VIEs due to the limited partners lacking the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power have concluded neither is the primary beneficiary as they do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these VIEs’ economic performance. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are obligated to provide capital contributions to the partnerships as required by each partnership agreement based on their ownership percentages. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s maximum exposure to loss is limited to their current and future investments.\n \nVirginia Power\n \nVirginia Power purchased shared services from DES, an affiliated VIE, of $\n494\n million, $\n463\n million and $\n396\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively. Virginia Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included amounts due to DES of $\n38\n million and $\n32\n million at December 31, \n2024 and 2023, respectively, recorded in payables to affiliates in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Virginia Power determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of DES as it does not have power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and benefits which could be significant to it. DES provides accounting, legal, finance and certain administrative and technical services to all Dominion Energy subsidiaries, including Virginia Power. Virginia Power has no obligation to absorb more than its allocated share of DES costs.\n \nAs described in Note 18, Virginia Power formed VPFS in October 2023, a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary which is considered to be a VIE, for the sole purpose of securitizing certain of Virginia Power’s under-recovered deferred fuel balance through the issuance of senior secured deferred fuel cost bonds. The Companies’ Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024\n included balances for VPFS in prepayments (less than $\n1\n million), regulatory assets-current ($\n124\n million), other current assets ($\n41\n million), regulatory assets-noncurrent ($\n1.0\n billion), securities due within one year ($\n163\n million), accrued interest, payroll and taxes ($\n10\n million) and securitization bonds ($\n1.1\n billion).\nAs described in Note 10, in October 2024 Virginia Power completed the sale of a \n50\n% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak through the sale of an interest in OSWP, which is considered to be a VIE. The Companies’ Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024 included balances for OSWP in cash and cash equivalents ($\n70\n million), customer receivables (less than $\n1\n million), prepayments ($\n10\n million), regulatory assets-current ($\n6\n million), property, plant and equipment ($\n5.8\n billion), regulatory assets-noncurrent ($\n52\n million), other deferred charges and other assets (less than $\n1\n million), accrued interest, payroll and taxes (less than $\n1\n million) and asset retirement obligations ($\n38\n million).\n\n\n \n161\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTE \n17. SHORT-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS\n \nThe Companies use short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion Energy utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion Energy’s credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.\n \nDominion Energy\n \nDominion Energy’s short-term financing is supported by its $\n6.0\n billion joint revolving credit facility that provides for a discount in the pricing of certain annual fees and amounts borrowed by Dominion Energy under the facility if Dominion Energy achieves certain annual renewable electric generation and diversity and inclusion objectives. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under the credit facility were as follows:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFacility Limit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOutstanding Commercial Paper\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOutstanding Letters of Credit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFacility Capacity Available\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint revolving credit facility\n(2)(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,061\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,929\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint revolving credit facility\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,547\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,437\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by Dominion Energy’s credit facility was \n4.74\n% and \n5.69\n% at December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, respectively.\n \n(2)\nThis credit facility matures in June 2026, with the potential to be extended by the borrowers to June 2028, and can be used by the borrowers under the credit facility to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to a combined $\n2.0\n billion of letters of credit.\n(3)\nIn May 2024, the joint revolving credit facility was amended to remove Questar Gas as a co-borrower.\n \n \nDESC’s short-term financings are supported through its access as a co-borrower to the joint revolving credit facility discussed above with the Companies. At December 31, 2024, the sub-limit for DESC was $\n500\n million.\n \nIn March 2023, FERC granted DESC authority through \nMarch 2025\n to issue short-term indebtedness (pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act) in amounts not to exceed $\n2.2\n billion outstanding with maturity dates of one year or less. In addition, in March 2023, FERC granted GENCO authority through \nMarch 2025\n to issue short-term indebtedness not to exceed $\n200\n million outstanding with maturity dates of one year or less. In January 2025, DESC and GENCO applied to FERC for a two-year short-term borrowing authorization in amounts not to exceed $\n1.8\n billion and $\n300\n million, respectively. The applications are pending.\n \nIn addition to the credit facility mentioned above, Dominion Energy had the following credit facilities and agreements:\n \n•\nA credit facility which allowed it to issue up to approximately $\n30\n million in letters of credit, which matured in \nJune 2024\n. At December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy had $\n25\n million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility.\n•\nAn agreement entered into with a financial institution in March 2023, which it expects to allow it to issue up to $\n100\n million in letters of credit. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $\n48\n million and $\n54\n million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under this agreement, respectively. \n•\nAn agreement entered into with a financial institution in June 2024, subsequently amended in January 2025, which it expects to allow it to issue up to a combined $\n275\n million in letters of credit at either Dominion Energy or Virginia Power. At December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy had $\n88\n million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under this agreement, including $\n77\n million for Virginia Power.\n•\nAn agreement entered into with a financial institution in January 2025, which it expects to allow it to issue up to a combined $\n150\n million in letters of credit, with $\n50\n million available to Dominion Energy and $\n100\n million available to Virginia Power. Through February 2025, Virginia Power had issued $\n50\n million in letters of credit.\n \nDominion Energy has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC for the sale of up to $\n3.0\n billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called Dominion Energy Reliability Investment\nSM\n. The registration limits the principal amount that may be outstanding at any one time to $\n1.0\n billion. \nThe notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Dominion Energy Reliability Investment Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The notes have no stated\n \n\n\n \n162\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmaturity \ndate, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Dominion Energy or at the investor’s option at any time. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include $\n439\n million and $\n409\n million, respectively, presented within short-term debt with weighted-average interest rates of 4\n.50\n% and \n5.50\n%, respectively. The proceeds are used for general corporate purposes and to repay debt.\nIn January 2023, Dominion Energy entered into a $\n2.5\n billion 364-day term loan facility which bore interest at a variable rate and was scheduled to mature in \nJanuary 2024\n with the proceeds to be used to repay existing long-term debt and short-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes. Concurrently, Dominion Energy borrowed an initial $\n1.0\n billion with the proceeds used to repay long-term debt. In February and March 2023, Dominion Energy borrowed $\n500\n million and $\n1.0\n billion, respectively, with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes and to repay long-term debt. At December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $\n2.5\n billion with respect to such facility presented within securities due within one year. In January 2024, the facility was amended to mature July 2024. The amended agreement contained certain mandatory early repayment provisions, including that any after-tax proceeds in connection with the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions be applied to any outstanding borrowings under the facility.  In March 2024, Dominion Energy repaid the full $\n2.5\n billion outstanding using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the East Ohio Transaction. The maximum allowed total debt to total capital ratio under the facility was consistent with such allowed ratio under Dominion Energy’s joint revolving credit facility.\n \nIn July 2023, Dominion Energy entered into two $\n600\n million 364-day term loan facilities which bore interest at a variable rate and were scheduled to mature in \nJuly 2024\n with the proceeds to be used to repay existing long-term debt and short-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes. Subsequently in July 2023, Dominion Energy borrowed an initial $\n750\n million in the aggregate under these facilities with the proceeds used to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. Dominion Energy was permitted to make up to three additional borrowings under each agreement through November 2023, at which point any unused capacity would cease to be available to Dominion Energy. The agreements contained certain mandatory early repayment provisions, including that any after-tax proceeds in connection with a sale of Dominion Energy’s noncontrolling interest in Cove Point, following the repayment of DECP Holding’s term loan secured by its noncontrolling interest in Cove Point, be applied to any outstanding borrowings under the facilities. In September 2023, Dominion Energy repaid the $\n750\n million borrowing with after-tax proceeds from the sale of Dominion Energy’s noncontrolling interest in Cove Point, as discussed in Note 9. Subsequently in September 2023, Dominion Energy borrowed $\n225\n million in the aggregate under these facilities with the proceeds used to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. In October 2023, Dominion Energy repaid the $\n225\n million borrowing and terminated the facilities along with any remaining unused commitments.\n \nIn October 2023, Dominion Energy entered into a $\n2.25\n billion 364-day term loan facility which bore interest at a variable rate with the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, which was scheduled to mature in \nOctober 2024\n. Concurrently, Dominion Energy borrowed an initial $\n1.0\n billion with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes, including to repay short-term and long-term debt. In November and December 2023, Dominion Energy borrowed $\n500\n million and $\n750\n million, respectively, with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes. Dominion Energy also had the ability through August 2024 to request an increase in the amount of this facility by up to an additional $\n500\n million. The agreement contained certain mandatory early repayment provisions, including that any after-tax proceeds in connection with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions, following the repayment of the 364-day term loan facility entered into in January 2023, be applied to any outstanding borrowings under this facility. At December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet included $\n2.25\n billion with respect to such facility presented within securities due within one year.  In March 2024, Dominion Energy repaid $\n1.8\n billion using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the East Ohio Transaction. Subsequently in March 2024, Dominion Energy requested and received a $\n500\n million increase to the amount of the facility and concurrently borrowed $\n500\n million with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes. In May 2024, Dominion Energy repaid the full $\n976\n million outstanding under the facility, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the Questar Gas Transaction. The maximum allowed total debt to total capital ratio under this facility was consistent with such allowed ratio under Dominion Energy’s joint revolving credit facility.\nVirginia Power\n \nVirginia Power’s short-term financing is supported through its access as co-borrower to Dominion Energy’s $\n6.0\n billion joint revolving credit facility. The credit facility can be used for working capital, as support for the combined commercial paper programs of the borrowers under the credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.\n \n\n\n \n163\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power’s share of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding under the joint revolving credit facility with Dominion Energy, Questar Gas (through May 2024) and DESC were as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFacility Limit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOutstanding Commercial Paper\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOutstanding Letters of Credit\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint revolving credit facility\n(2)(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n950\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint revolving credit facility\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n455\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe weighted-average interest rates of the outstanding commercial paper supported by the credit facility was \n4.73\n% and \n5.65\n% at December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, respectively.\n \n(2)\nThe full amount of the facility is available to Virginia Power, less any amounts outstanding to co-borrowers Dominion Energy and DESC. The sub-limit for Virginia Power is set pursuant to the terms of the facility but can be changed at the option of the borrowers multiple times per year. At December 31, 2024, the sub-limit for Virginia Power was $\n1.75\n billion. If Virginia Power has liquidity needs in excess of its sub-limit, the sub-limit may be changed or such needs may be satisfied through short-term intercompany borrowings from Dominion Energy. This credit facility matures in June 2026, with the potential to be extended by the borrowers to June 2028. The credit facility can be used to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to $\n2.0\n billion (or the sub-limit, whichever is less) of letters of credit.\n \n(3)\nIn May 2024, the joint revolving credit facility was amended to remove Questar Gas as a co-borrower\n. \nIn addition to the credit facility mentioned above, Virginia Power had the following credit facilities and agreements:\n•\nA credit facility entered into in January 2023 which allowed it to issue up to $\n125\n million in letters of credit and was scheduled to mature in \nJanuary 2026\n.

weighted-average coupon rates for debt outstanding as of December 31, \n2024\n.\n \n(2)\nThis $\n900\n million supplemental credit facility, entered in 2021, and amended in June 2024, offers a reduced interest rate margin with respect to borrowed amounts allocated to certain environmental sustainability or social investment initiatives. Proceeds of the supplemental credit facility also may be used for general corp\norate purposes, but such proceeds are not eligible for a reduced interest rate margin. In May 2022, Dominion Energy borrowed $\n900\n million. The proceeds from these borrowings were used to support environmental sustainability and social investment initiatives ($\n450\n million) and for general corporate purposes ($\n450\n million). In June 2022, Dominion Energy repaid $\n450\n million borrowed for general corporate purposes. In March 2023, Dominion Energy borrowed $\n450\n million with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes. In April 2023, Dominion Energy repaid $\n450\n million borrowed for general corporate purposes. In September 2023, Dominion Energy borrowed $\n450\n million under this facility with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes. In October 2023, Dominion Energy repaid $\n450\n million borrowed for general corporate purposes. In May 2024, Dominion Energy repaid $\n450\n million borrowed to support environmental sustainability and social investment initiatives. In June 2024, the facility was amended to extend the maturity date to \nJune 2025\n.\n \n(3)\nIncludes debt assumed by Dominion Energy from the merger of its former CNG subsidiary.\n(4)\n \nIn October 2024, Dominion Energy redeemed all $\n685\n million in outstanding principal amount of its October 2014 hybrids at par plus accrued interest including interest accrued at a floating rate effective October 2024.  The notes would have otherwise matured in \n2054\n.\n \n(5)\nThese financings relate to certain pollution control equipment at Virginia Power’s generating facilities. In May 2024, Virginia Power remarketed three series of tax-exempt bonds, with an aggregate outstanding principal of $\n243\n million to new investors. All three bonds will bear interest at a coupon of \n3.80\n% until \nMay 2027\n, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time.\n \n(6)\nIndustrial revenue bonds totaling $\n68\n million are secured by letters of credit that expire, subject to renewal, in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n(7)\nRepresents debt associated with Eagle Solar. In February 2024, Eagle Solar redeemed the remaining principal outstanding of $\n279\n million. The debt which otherwise would have matured in 2042 was nonrecourse to Dominion Energy and was secured by Eagle Solar's interest in certain solar facilities. As such, these borrowings are presented within securities due within one year in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023.

The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and/or to repay short-term debt.\nSenior Secured Deferred Fuel Cost Bonds\nIn February 2024, VPFS issued $\n439\n million of \n5.088\n% senior secured deferred fuel cost bonds with a scheduled final payment date of May 2027 and a final maturity date of May 2029 and $\n843\n million of \n4.877\n% senior secured deferred fuel cost bonds with a scheduled final payment date of May 2031 and a final maturity date of May 2033. The full principal of each tranche of bonds is payable semi-annually according to a sinking fund schedule. Interest on each tranche of bonds accrues from the date of issuance and is payable semi-annually. Payment on the bonds commenced in November 2024. The scheduled final payment date for the applicable tranche is the date by which all interest and principal for such tranche is expected to be paid in full. The final maturity date of the applicable tranche is the legal maturity date for such tranche. The bonds are not subject to optional redemption prior to their stated maturity. VPFS as the issuer of the bonds is a bankruptcy remote, wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Virginia Power formed in October 2023 for the sole purpose of securitizing certain of Virginia Power’s under-recovered deferred fuel balance through the issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds.  VPFS is considered to be a VIE primarily because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Virginia Power is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates VPFS as it has the power to direct the most significant activities of VPFS, including performing servicing activities such as billing and collecting the deferred fuel cost charges. Pursuant to the financing order issued by the Virginia Commission in November 2023, Virginia Power sold to VPFS its right to receive revenues from the non-bypassable deferred fuel cost charges from Virginia Power’s retail customers in Virginia, except for certain exempt customers, as deferred fuel cost property. The securitization bondholders have recourse solely with respect to the deferred fuel cost property owned by VPFS and no recourse to any other assets of Dominion Energy or Virginia Power.  Any deferred fuel cost charges collected by Virginia Power to pay for bond servicing and other qualified costs are deferred fuel cost property solely owned by VPFS.  Any deferred fuel cost charges collected by Virginia Power are remitted to a trustee and are not available to other creditors of Virginia Power or Dominion Energy.\nJunior Subordinated Notes\n \nIn October 2014, Dominion Energy issued $\n685\n million of October 2014 hybrids that bore interest at \n5.75\n% per year until October 1, 2024. In October 2024, Dominion Energy redeemed all $\n685\n million in outstanding principal amount at par plus accrued interest including interest accrued at a floating rate effective October 2024. The notes would have otherwise matured in \n2054\n. \nDominion\n \n\n\n \n166\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEnergy \nrecorded a charge of $\n7\n million ($\n5\n million after-tax) within interest expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income in connection with this early redemption.\nIn May 2024, Dominion Energy issued $\n2.0\n billion of junior subordinated notes, consisting of $\n1.0\n billion of 2024 Series A JSNs and $\n1.0\n billion of 2024 Series B JSNs that mature in \n2055 \nand \n2054\n, respectively. The 2024 Series A JSNs will bear interest at \n6.875\n% until February 1, 2030. The interest rate will reset every \nfive years\n beginning on February 1, 2030, to equal the then-current five-year \nU.S. Treasury rate plus\n a spread of \n2.386\n%, provided that the interest rate will not reset below \n6.875\n%. The 2024 Series B JSNs will bear interest at \n7.0\n% until June 1, 2034. The interest rate will reset every\n five years \nbeginning on June 1, 2034, to equal the then-current five-year \nU.S. Treasury rate plus\n a spread of \n2.511\n%, provided that the interest rate will not reset below \n7.0\n%. Dominion Energy may defer interest payments on the 2024 Series A JSNs or 2024 Series B JSNs on one or more occasions for up to \n10 \nconsecutive years. If interest payments on the 2024 Series A JSNs and the 2024 Series B JSNs are deferred, Dominion Energy may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, declare or pay any dividends or other distributions on, or redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any of its capital stock during the deferral period. Also, during the deferral period, Dominion Energy may not make any payments on or redeem or repurchase any debt securities or make any payments under any guarantee of debt that, in each case, is equal or junior in right of payment to the 2024 Series A JSNs and the 2024 Series B JSNs. Dominion Energy used the proceeds from this issuance for general corporate purposes including the repayment of short-term debt, the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Sustainability Revolving Credit Agreement as discussed above and the repurchase of Series B Preferred Stock as discussed in Note 19.\n \nIn November 2024, Dominion Energy issued $\n1.25\n billion of 2024 Series C JSNs that mature in \n2055\n. The 2024 Series C JSNs will bear interest at \n6.625\n% until May 15, 2035. The interest rate will reset every \nfive years\n beginning on May 15, 2035, to equal the then-current-five-year \nU.S. Treasury rate\n plus a spread of \n2.207\n%. Dominion Energy may defer interest payments on the 2024 Series C JSNs on one or more occasions for up to \n10\n consecutive years. If interest payments on the 2024 Series C JSNs are deferred, Dominion Energy may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, declare or pay any dividends or other distributions on, or redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any of its capital stock during the deferral period. Also, during the deferral period, Dominion Energy may not make any payments on or redeem or repurchase any debt securities or make any payments under any guarantee of debt that, in each case, is equal or junior in right of payment to the 2024 Series C JSNs. Dominion Energy used the proceeds from the issuance for general corporate purposes and to repay short-term debt.\n \nDerivative Restructuring\n \n \nIn June 2020, Dominion Energy amended a portfolio of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $\n2.0\n billion, extending the mandatory termination dates from 2020 and 2021 to \nDecember 2024\n. As a result of this noncash financing activity with an embedded interest rate swap, Dominion Energy recorded $\n326\n million in other long-term debt representing the net present value of the initial fair value measurement of the new contract with an imputed interest rate of \n1.19\n%, in its Consolidated Balance Sheets with an embedded interest rate derivative that had a fair value of zero at inception. In August 2021, Dominion Energy settled certain of the outstanding interest rate swaps which would have otherwise matured in December 2024, resulting in a $\n39\n million reduction in other long-term debt. In August 2022, Dominion Energy settled certain of the outstanding interest rate swaps which would have otherwise matured in \nDecember 2024\n, resulting in a $\n154\n million reduction in other long-term debt. In December 2024, Dominion Energy settled the remaining outstanding interest rate swaps resulting in a $\n144\n million reduction in securities due within one year.\n \nIn August 2020, Virginia Power amended a portfolio of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $\n900\n million, extending the mandatory termination dates from \n2020 \nto \nDecember 2023\n. As a result of this noncash financing activity with an embedded interest rate swap, Virginia Power recorded $\n443\n million in other long-term debt representing the net present value of the initial fair value measurement of the new contract with an imputed interest rate of \n0.34\n%, in its Consolidated Balance Sheets with an embedded interest rate derivative that had a fair value of zero at inception. The interest rate swaps were in a hedge relationship prior to the transaction. Virginia Power de-designated the hedge relationships prior to the transaction and then designated the new interest rate swap in a hedge relationship after the transaction. In March 2023, Virginia Power settled the remaining outstanding interest rate swaps which would have otherwise matured in December 2023, resulting in a $\n448\n million reduction in securities due within one year.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n167\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTE \n19. PREFERRED STOCK\n \nDominion Energy is authorized to issue up to \n20\n million shares of preferred stock,\n \nwhich may be designated into separate classes. At December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy had issued and outstanding \n1.0\n million shares of the Series C Preferred Stock. At December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy had issued and outstanding \n1.8\n million shares preferred stock, \n0.8\n million and \n1.0\n million of which were designated as the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, respectively.\n \nDESC is authorized to issue up to \n20\n million shares of preferred stock. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, DESC had issued and outstanding \n1,000\n shares of preferred stock, all of which were held by SCANA and are eliminated in consolidation.\nVirginia Power is authorized to issue up to \n10\n million shares of preferred stock, $\n100\n liquidation preference; however, \nno\nne were issued and outstanding at December 31, \n2024 or 2023.\n \n2019 Corporate Units\nIn June 2019, Dominion Energy issued $\n1.6\n billion of 2019 Equity Units, initially in the form of 2019 Series A Corporate Units. The Corporate Units were listed on the NYSE under the symbol DCUE. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay short-term debt, including commercial paper.\n \nEach 2019 Series A Corporate Unit consisted of a stock purchase contract and a 1/10, or \n10\n%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Series A Preferred Stock. Beginning in June 2022, the Series A Preferred Stock was convertible at the option of the holder. Settlement of any conversion was initially payable in cash, common stock or a combination thereof, at Dominion Energy’s election. In November 2021, Dominion Energy’s Articles of Incorporation were amended to require that any conversion of its \nSeries A Preferred Stock be settled, at Dominion Energy’s election, either entirely in cash or in cash up to the first $1,000 per share and in shares of Dominion Energy common stock, cash or any combination thereof for any amounts in excess of $1,000 per share.\n As a result of establishing a minimum amount to be settled in cash if the holders elect to convert the Series A Preferred Stock, $\n1.6\n billion was reclassified from equity to mezzanine equity in 2021. The Series A Preferred Stock was redeemable in cash by Dominion Energy beginning September 2022 at the liquidation preference.\n \nThe stock purchase contracts obligated the holders to purchase shares of Dominion Energy common stock in June 2022. The purchase price paid under the stock purchase contracts was $\n100\n per Corporate Unit and the number of shares purchased was determined under a formula based upon the average closing price of Dominion Energy common stock near the settlement date. See Note 20 for additional information. The Series A Preferred Stock had been pledged upon issuance as collateral to secure the purchase of common stock under the related stock purchase contracts. Dominion Energy paid cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and quarterly contract adjustment payments on the stock purchase contracts, at the rates described below.\nPursuant to the terms of the 2019 Equity Units, Dominion Energy conducted a final remarketing of substantially all shares of Series A Preferred Stock in May 2022 which resulted in the dividend rate for all shares of Series A Preferred Stock being reset to \n1.75\n% for the June 2022 through August 2022 dividend period and \n6.75\n% effective September 2022. The conversion rate on the Series A Preferred Stock did not increase as a result of the remarketing. In May 2022, Dominion Energy received a commitment from a financial institution to purchase up to \n1.6\n million shares of the Series A Preferred Stock in the final remarketing. Accordingly, following the settlement of the successful remarketing and approval from its Board of Directors in June 2022, Dominion Energy became obligated to redeem all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in September 2022. As such, effective June 2022, the Series A Preferred Stock was considered to be mandatorily redeemable and was classified as a current liability. In addition, Dominion Energy made a short-term deposit at the financial institution as described further in Note 9. Proceeds from the final remarketing were used on behalf of holders of 2019 Series A Corporate Units at the time of the remarketing to pay the purchase price to Dominion Energy for the issuance of its common stock under the stock purchase contracts included in such corporate units in June 2022. In September 2022, Dominion Energy redeemed all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $\n1.6\n billion.\nSelected information about Dominion Energy’s 2019 Equity Units is presented below:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssuance Date\n\n\n \n\n\nUnits Issued\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal Net\nProceeds\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal Preferred\nStock\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCumulative\nDividend Rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nStock Purchase\nContract\nAnnual Rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nStock Purchase\nContract\nLiability\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nStock Purchase\nContract\nSettlement Date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions except interest rates)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6/14/2019\n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,582\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,610\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.75\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n250\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6/1/2022\n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nIssuance costs of $\n28\n million were recorded as a reduction to preferred stock ($\n14\n million) and common stock ($\n14\n million).\n \nIn connection with the reclassification of the Series A Preferred Stock to mezzanine equity in 2021, the issuance costs originally recognized as a reduction to preferred stock were reclassified to common stock.\n(2)\nDominion Energy recorded dividends of $\n12\n million ($\n7.292\n per share) for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The preferred stock had a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\n per share and paid a \n4.65\n% dividend per share on the liquidation preference. Dividends were paid cumulatively on a semi-annual basis, commencing June 15, 2020. The dividend rate for the Series B Preferred Stock was scheduled to reset every five years beginning on December 15, 2024 to equal the then-current five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread of \n2.993\n%.\n \nDominion Energy was permitted to, at its option, redeem the Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part on December 15, 2024 or on any subsequent fifth anniversary of such date at a price equal to $\n1,000\n per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends.  Dominion Energy was also permitted to, at its option, redeem the Series B Preferred Stock in whole but not in part at a price equal to $\n1,020\n per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends at any time within a certain period of time following any change in the criteria ratings agencies use to assign equity credit to securities such as the Series B Preferred Stock that had certain adverse effects on the equity credit actually received by the Series B Preferred Stock.\n \nIn June 2024, Dominion Energy completed a tender offer repurchasing \n0.4\n million shares of Series B Preferred Stock and in December 2024 redeemed the remaining \n0.4\n million shares outstanding. Dominion Energy recorded dividends of $\n24\n million ($\n42.86\n per share) for the year ended December 31, 2024, excluding deemed dividends of $\n10\n million representing deferred issuance costs, legal and bank fees and excise tax associated with the repurchase and redemption, and $\n37\n million ($\n46.50\n per share) for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n \n \nSeries C Preferred Stock\nIn December 2021, Dominion Energy issued \n750,000\n shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $\n742\n million, net of $\n8\n million of issuance costs.

The Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan permits grants of restricted stock and stock options. Under provisions of these plans, employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase common stock at a price not less than its fair market value at the date of grant with a maximum term of \neight years\n. Option terms are set at the discretion of the Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors itself, as provided under each plan. No options are outstanding under either plan. At December 31, 2024, approximately \n27\n million shares were available for future grants under these plans.\n \nIn 2022 and 2023, goal-based stock awards were granted in lieu of cash-based performance grants to certain officers who have not achieved a certain targeted level of share ownership prior to 2024. Beginning in 2024, officers were granted performance share awards settling in shares or cash or, for officers who have not achieved a certain targeted level of share ownership at the time of grant, settling in shares. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards was inconsequential.\n \nDominion Energy measures and recognizes compensation expense relating to share-based payment transactions over the vesting period based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Dominion Energy’s results for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n include $\n53\n million, $\n44\n million and $\n36\n million,\n \nrespectively, of compensation costs and $\n12\n million, $\n10\n million and $\n7\n million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to Dominion Energy’s stock-based compensation arrangements. Stock-based compensation cost is reported in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Excess Tax Benefits are classified as a financing cash flow.\n\n\n \n173\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock grants are made to officers under Dominion Energy’s LTIP and may also be granted to certain key non-officer employees. The fair value of Dominion Energy’s restricted stock awards is equal to the closing price of Dominion Energy’s stock on the date of grant. New shares are issued for restricted stock awards on the date of grant and generally vest over a \nthree-year\n service period. \nThe following table provides a summary of restricted stock activity for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nShares (millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted-average Grant Date Fair Value\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonvested at December 31, 2021\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n76.65\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75.08\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n77.87\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancelled and forfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n73.15\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonvested at December 31, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n75.56\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n48.99\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n79.89\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancelled and forfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n53.36\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonvested at December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n61.34\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n55.58\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n71.05\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancelled and forfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n43.13\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonvested at December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n57.10\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n, unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards totaled $\n70\n million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n2.1\n years. The fair value of restricted stock awards that vested was $\n25\n million, $\n20\n million and $\n31\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Employees may elect to have shares of restricted stock withheld upon vesting to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The number of shares withheld will vary for each employee depending on the vesting date fair market value of Dominion Energy stock and the applicable federal, state and local tax withholding rates.\n \nCash-Based Performance Grants\nPrior to 2024, cash-based performance grants were issued to Dominion Energy’s officers under Dominion Energy’s LTIP. The actual payout of cash-based performance grants will vary between \nzero\n and \n200\n% of the targeted amount based on the level of performance metrics achieved.\n \nIn February 2021, a cash-based performance grant was made to officers. Payout of the performance grant occurred in January 2024 based on the achievement of two performance metrics during 2021, 2022 and 2023: TSR relative to that of companies that are members of Dominion Energy’s compensation peer group and ROIC. There is an additional opportunity to earn a portion of the award based on Dominion Energy’s relative price-earnings ratio performance. The total of the payout under the grant was $\n4\n million, all of which was accrued at December 31, 2023.\nIn February 2022, a cash-based performance grant was made to officers. Payout of the performance grant occurred in January 2025 based on the achievement of three performance metrics during 2022, 2023 and 2024: TSR relative to that of companies that are members of Dominion Energy’s compensation peer group, Cumulative Operating EPS and Non-Carbon Emitting Generation Capacity Performance. There was an additional opportunity to earn a portion of the award based on Dominion Energy’s relative price-earnings ratio performance. The total of the payout under the grant was $\n5\n million, all of which was accrued at December 31, 2024.\n \nIn February 2023, a cash-based performance grant was made to officers. Payout of the performance grant is expected to occur by March 15, 2026 based on the achievement of three performance metrics during 2023, 2024 and 2025: TSR relative to that of companies that are members of Dominion Energy’s compensation peer group over a 3-year and a 2-year period and Non-Carbon Emitting Generation Capacity Performance. For officers other than the CEO, there is an additional opportunity to earn a portion of the award based on Dominion Energy’s relative price-earnings ratio performance. At December 31, 2024, the targeted amount of the three-year grant was $\n15\n million and a liability of $\n11\n million had been accrued for this award.\nPerformance Share Awards\n \nPerformance share awards are granted under Dominion Energy’s LTIP. The performance share awards are settled in cash at the end of the three-year performance period if certain ownership requirements are satisfied. If the ownership requirements have not been met at the time of grant, then the performance share awards are settled in common stock.\n \n\n\n \n174\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn February 2024, a performance share grant was made to officers. Payout of the performance grant is expected to occur by March 15, 2027, based on the achievement of three performance metrics during 2024, 2025 and 2026: TSR relative to that of companies that are members of Dominion Energy’s compensation peer group, Cumulative Operating EPS and Non-Carbon Emitting Generation Capacity Performance. At December 31, 2024, the targeted amount of the three-year grant was $\n26\n million and a liability of $\n8\n million had been accrued for this award.\n \n\n\nNOTE \n21. DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\n \n \nThe Virginia Commission may prohibit any public service company, including Virginia Power, from declaring or paying a dividend to an affiliate if found to be inconsistent with the public interest. At December 31, 2024, the Virginia Commission had not restricted the payment of dividends by Virginia Power.\nThe North Carolina Commission, in its order approving the SCANA Combination, limited cumulative dividends payable to Dominion Energy by Virginia Power to (i) the amount of retained earnings the day prior to closing of the SCANA Combination plus (ii) any future earnings recorded by Virginia Power after such closing. \nIn addition, notice to the North Carolina Commission is required if payment of dividends causes the equity component of Virginia Power’s capital structure to fall below \n45\n%.\nThere is no specific restriction from the South Carolina Commission on the payment of dividends paid by DESC. Pursuant to the SCANA Merger Approval Order, the amount of any DESC dividends paid must be reasonable and consistent with the long-term payout ratio of the electric utility industry and gas distribution industry.\nDESC’s bond indenture under which it issues first mortgage bonds contains provisions that could limit the payment of cash dividends on its common stock. DESC's bond indenture permits the payment of dividends on DESC's common stock only either (1) out of its Surplus (as defined in the bond indenture) or (2) in case there is no Surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.\n \nAt December 31, 2024, DESC’s retained earnings exceed the balance established by the Federal Power Act as a reserve on earnings attributable to hydroelectric generation plants. As a result, DESC is permitted to pay dividends without additional regulatory approval provided that such amounts would not bring the retained earnings balance below the established threshold.\nSee Notes 18 and 19 for a description of potential restrictions on common stock dividend payments by Dominion Energy in connection with the deferral of interest payments on the junior subordinated notes or a failure to pay dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock.\n \n\n\nNOTE \n22. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nDefined Benefit Plans\n \nDominion Energy provides certain retirement benefits to eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. Under the terms of its benefit plans, Dominion Energy reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plans. From time to time in the past, benefits have changed, and some of these changes have reduced benefits.\n \nDominion Energy maintains qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering virtually all employees who commenced employment prior to July 2021. Retirement benefits are based primarily on years of service, age and the employee’s compensation. Dominion Energy’s funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with the provisions of ERISA. The pension programs also provide benefits to certain retired executives under company-sponsored nonqualified employee benefit plans. The nonqualified plans are funded through contributions to grantor trusts. Dominion Energy also provides retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits with annual employee premiums based on several factors such as age, retirement date and years of service.\n \nPension and other postretirement benefit costs are affected by employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and years of service), the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. These costs may also be affected by changes in key assumptions, including expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality rates and the rate of compensation increases.\n \nDominion Energy uses December 31 as the measurement date for all of its employee benefit plans. Dominion Energy immediately recognizes the change in the fair value of plan assets and liabilities and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year as well as whenever a triggering event occurs that is determined to require remeasurement. Actuarial losses\n \n\n\n \n175\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nattributable to Dominion Energy’s rate regulated operations are deferred to regulatory assets when it is probable that regulators will permit them to be recovered from customers in future rates. Likewise, actuarial gains attributable to Dominion Energy’s rate regulated operations are deferred to regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds or other benefits through future rates.\n \nDominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement plan assets experienced aggregate actual returns of $\n738\n million and $\n1.2\n billion in \n2024 and 2023\n, respectively, versus expected returns of $\n982\n million and $\n1.0\n billion, respectively. Any investment-related declines in these trusts are immediately recognized in earnings and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans.\n \nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Remeasurements\nAs a result of the East Ohio and Questar Gas Transactions in 2024, Dominion Energy remeasured its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The remeasurements resulted in $\n217\n million ($\n162\n million after-tax) of higher market related impacts on pension and other postretirement plans related to the East Ohio and Questar Gas Transactions, reflected in other income (expense) in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statement of Income. The discount rates used for the remeasurements related to the East Ohio and Questar Gas Transactions were \n5.62\n% and \n5.75\n% for the pension plans and \n5.61\n%-\n5.62\n% and \n5.74\n% for the other postretirement benefit plans, respectively. All other assumptions used for the remeasurements were consistent with the measurement as of December 31, 2023.\n \nFunded Status\nThe following table summarizes the changes in pension plan and other

Based on the funded status of each plan and other factors, Dominion Energy determines the amount of contributions for the current year, if any, at that time. Dominion Energy expects to make $\n22\n million of minimum required contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in \n2025. Dominion Energy also considers voluntary contributions from time to time, either in the form of cash or equity securities.\n \nCertain of Dominion Energy’s subsidiaries fund other postretirement benefit costs through VEBAs. Dominion Energy’s remaining subsidiaries do \nno\nt prefund other postretirement benefit costs but instead pay claims as presented. Dominion Energy did not make any contributions to VEBAs associated with its other postretirement plans in \n2024 and 2023. Dominion Energy is not required to make any contributions to its VEBAs associated with its other postretirement plans in 2025.

To minimize risk, funds are broadly diversified among asset classes, investment strategies and investment advisors. \nIn December 2024, Dominion Energy revised its long-term strategic target asset allocation for its pension funds to \n30\n% public equity (inclusive of both U.S. equity and non-U.S. equity), \n27\n% fixed income and \n43\n% other alternative investments. Public equity includes investments in U.S. and non-U.S. large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap companies. Fixed income includes government securities and cash. The public equity and fixed income investments are in individual securities as well as mutual funds and exchange traded funds. Other alternative investments include private equity, typically through limited partnerships, and credit and absolute return strategies which include investments in public debt, private debt and hedge funds.\n\n\n \n177\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThrough December 2024, the long-term strategic target asset allocations for substantially all of Dominion Energy’s pension funds were \n26\n%\n U.S. equity, \n19\n%\n non-U.S. equity, \n32\n%\n fixed income, \n3\n%\n real assets and \n20\n%\n other alternative investments. U.S. equity includes investments in large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap companies located in the U.S. Non-U.S. equity includes investments in large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap companies located outside of the U.S. including both developed and emerging markets. Fixed income includes corporate debt instruments of companies from diversified industries and U.S. Treasuries. The U.S. equity, non-U.S. equity and fixed income investments are in individual securities as well as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Real assets include investments in real estate investment trusts and private partnerships. Other alternative investments include partnership investments in private equity-debt and hedge funds that follow several different strategies.\nStrategic investment policies are established for Dominion Energy’s prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans’ strategic allocation are a function of Dominion Energy’s assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans’ actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns. Financial derivatives may be used to obtain or manage market exposures and to hedge assets and liabilities.\n \nFor fair value measurement policies and procedures related to pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, see Note 2.\n \nThe fair values of Dominion Energy’s pension plan assets by asset category are as follows:\n

Interest-bearing cash and money market funds are valued at cost plus accrued interest. The foreign cash balances are valued at the amount held and translated on the reporting date based on prevailing exchange rates. Foreign cash and money market funds are classified as Level 1. The interest-bearing cash is held in variation margin and with various brokers, which are less liquid and therefore are classified as Level 2. \n•\nCommon and Preferred Stocks\n—Investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. Investments in certain preferred stocks are classified as Level 2 and are valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities. This includes basing value on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. \n•\nInsurance Contracts\n—Investments in Group Annuity Contracts are stated at fair value based on the fair value of the underlying securities as provided by the managers and include investments in U.S. government securities, corporate debt instruments and state and municipal debt securities. \n\n\n \n179\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nCorporate Debt Instruments\n—Investments are valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities. This includes basing value on yields currently available for comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. When quoted prices are not available for identical or similar instruments, the instrument is valued under a discounted cash flows approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks or a broker quote, if available. \n•\nGovernment Securities\n—Investments are valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities. \n•\nCommingled Funds/Collective Trust Funds\n—Commingled funds/collective trust funds invest in debt and equity securities and other instruments with characteristics similar to those of the funds’ benchmarks. The primary objectives of the funds are to seek investment returns that approximate the overall performance of their benchmark indexes. These benchmarks are major equity indices, fixed income indices and money market indices that focus on growth, income and liquidity strategies, as applicable. Investments in commingled funds/collective trust funds are stated at the NAV as determined by the issuer of the commingled funds/collective trust funds and are based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund less its liabilities. The NAV is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. The commingled funds/collective trust funds do not have any unfunded commitments, and do not have any applicable liquidation periods or defined terms/periods to be held. The majority of these funds have redemption restrictions allowing investors to redeem capital on a periodic basis. \n•\nAlternative Investments\n—Investments in private real estate funds, private equity funds, private debt funds and hedge funds are stated at fair value based on the NAV of the plan’s proportionate share of the partnership, joint venture or other alternative investment’s fair value as determined by reference to audited financial statements or NAV statements provided by the investment manager. The NAV, which is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value, is adjusted for contributions and distributions occurring between the investment manager and Dominion Energy’s measurement date. These valuations also involve assumptions and methods that are reviewed, evaluated, and adjusted, if necessary, by Dominion Energy. \nNet Periodic Benefit (Credit) Cost\n \nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit (credit) cost is reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income, except for $\n5\n million, $\n18\n million and $\n25\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively, presented in discontinued operations. The non-service cost components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost are reflected in other income (expense) in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income, except for $\n12\n million, $(\n46\n) million and $(\n81\n) million for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, \nrespectively, presented in\n \n\n\n \n180\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndiscontinued \noperations.

December 31, 2023, includes $\n173\n million presented in assets and liabilities held for sale.\nThe expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality are critical assumptions in determining net periodic benefit (credit) cost. Dominion Energy develops non-investment related assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent investment advisor to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions used for Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement plans including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates.\n \nDominion Energy determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for its pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:\n \n•\nExpected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; \n•\nHistorical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes; \n\n\n \n181\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nExpected future risk premiums, asset classes’ volatilities and correlations; \n•\nForward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the expected long-term returns of major capital market assumptions; and \n•\nInvestment allocation of plan assets. \nDominion Energy determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans.\n \nMortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for postretirement benefit plans. Dominion Energy’s actuary conducts an experience study periodically as part of the process to select its best estimate of mortality. Dominion Energy considers both standard mortality tables and improvement factors as well as the plans’ actual experience when selecting a best estimate.\n \nAssumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for Dominion Energy’s retiree healthcare plans. Dominion Energy establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected and demographics of plan participants.\n \nOther Employee Matters\n \nIn the first quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n23\n million ($\n17\n million after-tax) within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income attributable to a contribution to its defined contribution employee savings plan associated with the closing of the East Ohio Transaction. In addition, in the first quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of $\n13\n million ($\n10\n million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to a severance accrual for certain employees in connection with the business review.\nVirginia Power Participation in Defined Benefit Plans\n \nVirginia Power employees are covered by the Dominion Energy Pension Plan described above. As a participating employer, Virginia Power is subject to Dominion Energy’s funding policy, which is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with ERISA. Virginia Power made no contribution payments to the Dominion Energy Pension Plan during 2024 and 2023. During 2022\n, Virginia Power made payments to Dominion Energy of $\n172\n million, related to its participation in the Dominion Energy Pension Plan. Virginia Power’s net periodic pension cost related to this plan was $\n49\n million, $\n34\n million and $\n72\n million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net periodic benefit (credit) cost is reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in Virginia Power’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The funded status of various Dominion Energy subsidiary groups and employee compensation are the basis for determining the share of total pension costs for participating Dominion Energy subsidiaries. See Note 25 for Virginia Power amounts due to/from Dominion Energy related to this plan.\n \nRetiree healthcare and life insurance benefits, for Virginia Power employees are covered by the Dominion Energy Retiree Health and Welfare Plan described above. Virginia Power’s net periodic benefit (credit) cost related to this plan was $(\n72\n) million, $(\n60\n) million and $(\n81\n) million in \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net periodic benefit (credit) cost is reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in Virginia Power’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Employee headcount is the basis for determining the share of total other postretirement benefit costs for participating Dominion Energy subsidiaries. See Note 25 for Virginia Power amounts due to/from Dominion Energy related to this plan.\n \nDominion Energy holds investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans in which Virginia Power’s employees participate. Any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the net periodic cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash that Virginia Power will provide to Dominion Energy for its share of employee benefit plan contributions.\nVirginia Power funds other postretirement benefit costs through VEBAs. During 2024, 2023 and 2022\n, Virginia Power made \nno\n contributions to the VEBAs and does \nno\nt expect to contribute to the VEBAs in \n2025.\n \nDefined Contribution Plans\n \nDominion Energy also sponsors defined contribution employee savings plans that cover substantially all employees. During 2024, 2023 and 2022\n, Dominion Energy recognized $\n82\n million, $\n85\n million and $\n75\n million, respectively, as employer matching contributions to these plans, excluding discontinued operations. Virginia Power also participates in these employee savings plans. During \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, Virginia Power recognized $\n29\n million, $\n26\n million and $\n22\n million, respectively, as employer matching contributions to these plans.\n \n\n\n \n182\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTE \n23. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n \nAs a result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, the Companies are involved in legal proceedings before various courts and are periodically subject to governmental examinations (including by regulatory authorities), inquiries and investigations. Certain legal proceedings and governmental examinations involve demands for unspecified amounts of damages, are in an initial procedural phase, involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, such that it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For such matters that the Companies cannot estimate, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the litigation or investigative processes such that the Companies are able to estimate a range of possible loss. For legal proceedings and governmental examinations that the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in excess of the accrued liability (if any) for such matters. The Companies maintain various insurance programs, including general liability insurance coverage which provides coverage for personal injury or wrongful death cases. Any accrued liability is recorded on a gross basis with a receivable also recorded for any probable insurance recoveries. Estimated ranges of loss are inclusive of legal fees and net of any anticipated insurance recoveries. Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the Companies’ maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such legal proceedings and governmental examinations will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current proceedings not specifically reported below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on the Companies’ financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n \nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Companies are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.\n \n \nAir\nThe CAA, as amended, is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation’s air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to meet applicable requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies’ facilities are subject to the CAA’s permitting and other requirements.\n \nOzone Standards\n \nThe EPA published final non-attainment designations for the October 2015 ozone standards in June 2018 with states required to develop plans to address the new standard. Certain states in which the Companies operate have developed plans, and had such plans approved or partially approved by the EPA, which are not expected to have a material impact on the Companies’ results of operations or cash flows. In March 2023, the EPA issued a final rule specifying an interstate federal implementation plan to comply with certain aspects of planning for the 2015 ozone standards which was applicable in August 2023 for certain states, including Virginia. The interstate federal implementation plan imposes tighter NO\nX\n emissions limits during the ozone season and includes provisions for the use of allowances to cover such emissions. Unless and until implementation plans for the 2015 ozone standards are fully developed and approved and in effect for all states in which the Companies operate, the Companies are unable to predict whether or to what extent the new rules will ultimately require additional controls. The expenditures required to implement additional controls could have a material impact on the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nACE Rule\nIn July 2019, the EPA published the final rule informally referred to as the ACE Rule, as a replacement for the Clean Power Plan. The ACE Rule regulated GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants pursuant to Section 111(d) of the CAA and required states to develop plans by July 2022 establishing unit-specific performance standards for existing coal-fired power plants. In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE Rule and remanded it to the EPA. This decision would take effect upon issuance of the court’s mandate. In March 2021, the court issued a partial mandate vacating and remanding all parts of the ACE Rule except for the portion of the ACE Rule that repealed the Clean Power Plan. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s decision on the ACE Rule. In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit’s decision on the ACE Rule and remanded the case back to the D.C. Circuit. In May 2024, the EPA repealed the ACE Rule as part of a package of final rules addressing CO\n2\n emissions from new and existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units.\n \n\n\n \n183\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCarbon Regulations\n \nIn August 2016, the EPA issued a draft rule proposing to reaffirm that a source’s obligation to obtain a PSD or Title V permit for GHGs is triggered only if such permitting requirements are first triggered by non-GHG, or conventional, pollutants that are regulated by the New Source Review program, and exceed a significant emissions rate of \n75,000\n tons per year of CO\n2\n equivalent emissions. Until the EPA ultimately takes final action on this rulemaking, the Companies cannot predict the impact to their results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\n \n \nIn December 2018, the EPA proposed revised Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources. The proposed rule would amend the previous determination that the best system of emission reduction for newly constructed coal-fired steam generating units is no longer partial carbon capture and storage. Instead, the proposed revised best system of emission reduction for this source category is the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle (e.g., supercritical steam conditions for large units and subcritical steam conditions for small units) in combination with best operating practices. In May 2024, the EPA withdrew the proposed revision to the performance standards for coal-fired steam generating units as part of a package of final rules addressing CO\n2\n emissions from new and existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units.\n \nWater\n \nThe CWA, as amended, is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. The Companies must comply with applicable aspects of the CWA programs at their operating facilities.\n \nRegulation 316(b)\n \nIn October 2014, the final regulations under Section 316(b) of the CWA that govern existing facilities and new units at existing facilities that employ a cooling water intake structure and that have flow levels exceeding a minimum threshold became effective. The rule establishes a national standard for impingement based on seven compliance options, but forgoes the creation of a single technology standard for entrainment. Instead, the EPA has delegated entrainment technology decisions to state regulators. State regulators are to make case-by-case entrainment technology determinations after an examination of \nfive\n mandatory facility-specific factors, including a social cost-benefit test, and \nsix\n optional facility-specific factors. The rule governs all electric generating stations with water withdrawals above \ntwo\n MGD, with a heightened entrainment analysis for those facilities over \n125\n MGD. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power currently have \n14\n and \neight\n facilities, respectively, that are subject to the final regulations. Dominion Energy is also working with the EPA and state regulatory agencies to assess the applicability of Section 316(b) to \neight\n hydroelectric facilities, including \nthree\n Virginia Power facilities. The Companies anticipate that they may have to install impingement control technologies at certain of these stations that have once-through cooling systems. The Companies are currently evaluating the need or potential for entrainment controls under the final rule as these decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after a thorough review of detailed biological, technological, and cost benefit studies. DESC is conducting studies and implementing plans as required by the rule to determine appropriate intake structure modifications at certain facilities to ensure compliance with this rule. While the impacts of this rule could be material to the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory frameworks in South Carolina and Virginia provide rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for the regulated electric utilities.\nEffluent Limitations Guidelines\nIn September 2015, the EPA released a final rule to revise the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Steam Electric Power Generating Category. The final rule established updated standards for wastewater discharges that apply primarily at coal and oil steam generating stations. Affected facilities are required to convert from wet to dry or closed cycle coal ash management, improve existing wastewater treatment systems and/or install new wastewater treatment technologies in order to meet the new discharge limits. In April 2017, the EPA granted \ntwo\n separate petitions for reconsideration of the Effluent Limitations Guidelines final rule and stayed future compliance dates in the rule. Also in April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the EPA’s request for a stay of the pending consolidated litigation challenging the rule while the EPA addresses the petitions for reconsideration. In September 2017, the EPA signed a rule to postpone the earliest compliance dates for certain waste streams regulations in the Effluent Limitations Guidelines final rule from November 2018 to November 2020; however, the latest date for compliance for these regulations was December 2023. In October 2020, the EPA released the final rule that extended the latest dates for compliance with individual facilities’ compliance dates that would vary based on circumstances and the determination by state regulators and may range from \n2021\n to \n2028\n. In May 2024, the EPA released a final rule revising the 2015 and 2020 Effluent Limitations Guidelines, establishing more stringent standards for wastewater discharges for the Steam Electric Power Generating Category, which apply primarily to wastewater discharges at coal and oil steam generating stations. Individual facilities’ compliance dates will vary based on circumstances and the determination by state regulators and may range to \n2029\n, except in certain circumstances when a facility will be retired by \n2034\n. \nDominion Energy expects to complete wastewater treatment technology retrofits and modifications at its Williams generating station, with a similar project at its Wateree generation station under evaluation, to meet the requirements with the existing\n \n\n\n \n184\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nregulatory \nframework in South Carolina providing rate recovery mechanisms for costs of the projects. As discussed in Note 14, the Companies recorded an increase to their AROs in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the expected compliance costs associated with the EPA’s May 2024 final rule concerning CCR. The Companies expect that such AROs would satisfy any AROs that would have otherwise been necessary for compliance with the EPA’s May 2024 Effluent Limitations Guidelines. Dominion Energy is currently unable to estimate what costs, if any, may be required in addition to the project for the Williams generating station, a potential project at the Wateree generating station and the recorded AROs to meet the requirements to operate certain facilities past 2034. However, Dominion Energy expects that while such costs for facility improvements, if required, could be material to the Companies’ financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory frameworks in Virginia and South Carolina provide rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts.\n \nWaste Management and Remediation\n \n \nThe operations of the Companies are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and release of hazardous substances associated with current and/or historical operations. The CERCLA, as amended, and similar state laws, may impose joint, several and strict liability for cleanup on potentially responsible parties who owned, operated or arranged for disposal at facilities affected by a release of hazardous substances. In addition, many states have created programs to incentivize voluntary remediation of sites where historical releases of hazardous substances are identified and property owners or responsible parties decide to initiate cleanups.\n \n \nFrom time to time, the Companies may be identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the alleged release of hazardous substances or wastes at a site. Under applicable federal and state laws, the Companies could be responsible for costs associated with the investigation or remediation of impacted sites, or subject to contribution claims by other responsible parties for their costs incurred at such sites. The Companies also may identify, evaluate and remediate other potentially impacted sites under voluntary state programs. Remediation costs may be subject to reimbursement under the Companies’ insurance policies, rate recovery mechanisms, or both. Except as described below, the Companies do not believe these matters will have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\n \n \nDominion Energy has determined that it is associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, including certain sites associated with Virginia Power. At \nfour\n sites associated with Dominion Energy, remediation work has been substantially completed under federal or state oversight. Where required, the sites are following state-approved groundwater monitoring programs. Dominion Energy has proposed remediation plans for \none\n site at Virginia Power and expects to commence remediation activities in 2025 depending on receipt of final permits and approvals. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy had $\n56\n million and $\n32\n   million, respectively, of reserves recorded including a charge of $\n25\n million ($\n19\n million after-tax) that Virginia Power recorded in 2024, reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Virginia Power had $\n50\n million and $\n25\n million of reserves recorded, respectively. Dominion Energy is associated with \nthree\n additional sites, including \ntwo\n associated with Virginia Power, which are not under investigation by any state or federal environmental agency nor the subject of any current or proposed plans to perform remediation activities. Due to the uncertainty surrounding such sites, the Companies are unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts.\nOther Legal Matters\n \nThe Companies are defendants in a number of lawsuits and claims involving unrelated incidents of property damage and personal injury. In 2024, Dominion Energy resolved a claim associated with operations included in the East Ohio Transaction and at December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a $\n30\n million offsetting reserve and insurance receivable. The related charge in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024 is inconsequential. Due to the uncertainty surrounding other matters, the Companies are unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts; however, they could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\n \nSCANA Legal Proceedings\nThe following describes certain legal proceedings involving Dominion Energy, SCANA or DESC relating primarily to events occurring before closing of the SCANA Combination. No reference to, or disclosure of, any proceeding, item or matter described below shall be construed as an admission or indication that such proceeding, item or matter is material. For certain of these matters, and unless otherwise noted therein, Dominion Energy is unable to estimate a reasonable range of possible loss and the related financial statement impacts, but for any such matter there could be a material impact to its results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. For the matters for which Dominion Energy is able to reasonably estimate a probable loss, Dominion Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 included an inconsequential amount of reserves primarily related to personal injury or\n \n\n\n \n185\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwrongful death cases. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, charges included in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income were inconsequential.\n \n \nMatters Fully Resolved Prior to 2024 Impacting the Consolidated Financial Statements\nGovernmental Proceedings and Investigations\n \nIn June 2018, DESC received a notice of proposed assessment of approximately $\n410\n million, excluding interest, from the SCDOR following its audit of DESC’s sales and use tax returns for the periods September 1, 2008 through December 31, 2017. The proposed assessment, which includes \n100\n% of the NND Project, is based on the SCDOR’s position that DESC’s sales and use tax exemption for the NND Project does not apply because the facility will not become operational. In December 2020, the parties reached an agreement in principle in the amount of $\n165\n million to resolve this matter. In June 2021, the parties executed a settlement agreement which allows DESC to fund the settlement amount through a combination of cash, shares of Dominion Energy common stock or real estate with an initial payment of at least $\n43\n million in shares of Dominion Energy common stock. In August 2021, Dominion Energy issued \n0.6\n million shares of its common stock to satisfy DESC’s obligation for the initial payment under the settlement agreement. In May 2022, Dominion Energy issued an additional \n0.9\n million shares of its common stock to partially satisfy DESC’s remaining obligation under the settlement agreement. In June 2022, DESC requested approval from the South Carolina Commission to transfer certain real estate with a total settlement value of $\n51\n million to satisfy its remaining obligation under the settlement agreement. In July 2022, the South Carolina Commission voted to approve the request and issued its final order in August 2022. In September 2022, DESC transferred certain non-utility property with a fair value of $\n28\n million to the SCDOR under the settlement agreement, resulting in a gain of $\n18\n million ($\n14\n million after-tax) recorded in losses (gains) on sales of assets (reflected in Dominion Energy South Carolina) in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. In December 2022, DESC transferred additional utility property with a fair value of $\n3\n million to the SCDOR, resulting in an inconsequential gain. In October 2022, DESC filed for approval to transfer the remaining real estate with FERC which was received in November 2022. In March 2023, DESC transferred utility property with a fair value of $\n10\n million to the SCDOR resulting in a gain of $\n9\n million ($\n7\n million after-tax), recorded in losses (gains) on sales of assets (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment) in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023. In June 2023, DESC transferred the remaining utility property with a fair value of $\n11\n million to the SCDOR resulting in a gain of $\n11\n million ($\n8\n million after-tax), recorded in losses (gains) on sales of assets (reflected in the Corporate and Other segment) in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023. In July 2023, DESC made a less than $\n1\n million cash payment to the SCDOR to fully satisfy its remaining obligation, including applicable interest, under the settlement agreement.\nSCANA Shareholder Litigation\n \nIn September 2017, a shareholder derivative action was filed against certain former executive officers and directors of SCANA in the State Court of Common Pleas in Richland County, South Carolina (the State Court Derivative Case). In September 2018, this action was consolidated with another action in the Business Court Pilot Program in Richland County. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders by their gross mismanagement of the NND Project, and that the defendants were unjustly enriched by bonuses they were paid in connection with the project. In January 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated action. In February 2019, one action was voluntarily dismissed. In March 2020, the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the defendants filed a notice of appeal with the South Carolina Court of Appeals and a petition with the Supreme Court of South Carolina seeking appellate review of the denial of the motion to dismiss. In June 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the appeal with the South Carolina Court of Appeals, which was granted in July 2020. In August 2020, the Supreme Court of South Carolina denied the defendants’ petition seeking appellate review. Also in August 2020, the defendants filed a petition for rehearing with the South Carolina Court of Appeals relating to the July 2020 ruling by the court, which was denied in October 2020. In November 2020, SCANA filed a petition of certiorari with the Supreme Court of South Carolina seeking appellate review of the denial of SCANA’s motion to dismiss. This petition was denied in June 2021. Also in June 2021, the parties reached an agreement in principle in the amount of $\n33\n million to resolve this matter, subject to court approval. This settlement was reached in contemplation of and to be utilized to satisfy a portion of the Federal Court Merger Case and the State Court Merger Case discussed below. In November 2021, the parties executed a settlement agreement and filed with the State Court of Common Pleas in Richland County, South Carolina for approval. In June 2022, the State Court of Common Pleas in Richland County, South Carolina issued final approval of the settlement agreement with the funds utilized to satisfy a portion of the State Court Merger Case as discussed below.\n \nIn January 2018, a purported class action was filed against SCANA, Dominion Energy and certain former executive officers and directors of SCANA in the State Court of Common Pleas in Lexington County, South Carolina (the City of Warren Lawsuit). The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that defendants violated their fiduciary duties to shareholders by executing a merger agreement that would unfairly deprive plaintiffs of the true value of their SCANA stock, and that Dominion Energy aided and abetted these actions. Among other remedies, the plaintiff seeks to enjoin and/or rescind the merger.\n \n\n\n \n186\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn February 2018, a purported class action was filed against Dominion Energy and certain former directors of SCANA and DESC in the State Court of Common Pleas in Richland County, South Carolina (the Metzler Lawsuit). The allegations made and the relief sought by the plaintiffs are substantially similar to that described for the City of Warren Lawsuit.\n \nIn September 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina granted the plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate the City of Warren Lawsuit and the Metzler Lawsuit (the Federal Court Merger Case). In October 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against certain former directors and executive officers of SCANA and DESC, which stated substantially similar allegations to those in the City of Warren Lawsuit and the Metzler Lawsuit as well as an inseparable fraud claim. In November 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina denied the motion to dismiss. In May 2020, SCANA filed a motion to intervene, which was denied in August 2020. In September 2020, SCANA filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In June 2021, the parties reached an agreement in principle in the amount of $\n63\n million to resolve this matter as well as the State Court Merger Case described below, subject to court approval. This settlement was reached in contemplation of and to be partially satisfied by the State Court Derivative Case settlement described above. In November 2021, the parties executed a settlement agreement, as described above relating to this matter as well as the State Court Derivative Case and the State Court Merger Case, and filed with the State Court of Common Pleas in Richland County, South Carolina for approval. In June 2022, this case was dismissed in connection with the final approval by the State Court of Common Pleas in Richland County, South Carolina of the settlement agreement.\n \nIn May 2019, a case was filed against certain former executive officers and directors of SCANA in the State Court of Common Pleas in Richland County, South Carolina (the State Court Merger Case). The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders by their gross mismanagement of the NND Project, were unjustly enriched by the bonuses they were paid in connection with the project and breached their fiduciary duties to secure and obtain the best price for the sale of SCANA. Also in May 2019, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court of South Carolina by the non-South Carolina defendants.  In June 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court. In January 2020, the case was remanded to state court. In February 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In June 2021, the parties reached an agreement in principle as described above relating to this matter as well as the Federal Court Merger Case and the State Court Derivative Case. In November 2021, the parties executed a settlement agreement, as described above relating to this matter as well as the State Court Derivative Case and the Federal Court Merger Case, and filed with the State Court of Common Pleas in Richland County, South Carolina for approval. In June 2022, the State Court of Common Pleas in Richland County, South Carolina issued final approval of the settlement agreement.  Also in June 2022, Dominion Energy utilized the $\n33\n million of insurance proceeds from the State Court Derivative Case settlement, the issuance of \n0.4\n million shares of its common stock and the payment of $\n2\n million in cash to satisfy its obligations under the settlement agreement.\nNuclear Operations\n \nNuclear Decommissioning – Minimum Financial Assurance\nThe NRC requires nuclear power plant owners to annually update minimum financial assurance amounts for the future decommissioning of their nuclear facilities. Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station once operations have ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. The 2024\n calculation for the NRC minimum financial assurance amount, aggregated for Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s nuclear units, excluding joint owners’ assurance amounts and Millstone Unit 1, as this unit is in a decommissioning state, was $\n3.4\n billion and $\n2.0\n billion, respectively, and has been satisfied by a combination of the funds being collected and deposited in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the real annual rate of return growth of the funds allowed by the NRC. The \n2024 NRC minimum financial assurance amounts above were calculated using preliminary December 31, 2024 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indices. Dominion Energy believes that decommissioning funds and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone units. In addition, Dominion Energy believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Summer unit, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions. The Companies believe the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient to cover decommissioning costs, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects a positive long-term outlook for trust fund investment returns as the decommissioning of the units will not be complete for decades. The Companies will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial assurance requirement, which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC. See Note 9 for additional information on nuclear decommissioning trust investments.\n \nNuclear Insurance\nThe Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 provides the public up to $\n16.3\n billion \nof liability protection on a per site, per nuclear incident basis, via obligations required of owners of nuclear power plants, and allows for an inflationary provision adjustment every\n \n\n\n \n187\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nfive \nyears. During the first quarter of 2024, the total liability protection per nuclear incident available to all participants in the Secondary Financial Protection Program increased from $\n16.2\n billion to $\n16.3\n billion. These increases do not impact Dominion Energy’s responsibility per active unit under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988. The Companies have purchased $\n500\n million of coverage from commercial insurance pools for Millstone, Summer, Surry and North Anna with the remainder provided through the mandatory industry retrospective rating plan. In the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear reactor in the U.S., the Companies could be assessed up to $\n166\n million for each of their licensed reactors not to exceed $\n25\n million per year per reactor. There is no limit to the number of incidents for which this retrospective premium can be assessed. The current levels of nuclear property insurance coverage for Millstone, Summer, Surry and North Anna are all $\n1.06\n billion.\n \nThe Companies’ nuclear property insurance coverage for Millstone, Summer, Surry and North Anna meets or exceeds the NRC minimum requirement for nuclear power plant licensees of $\n1.06\n billion per reactor site. This includes coverage for premature decommissioning and functional total loss. The NRC requires that the proceeds from this insurance be used first, to return the reactor to and maintain it in a safe and stable condition and second, to decontaminate the reactor and station site in accordance with a plan approved by the NRC. Nuclear property insurance is provided by NEIL, a mutual insurance company, and is subject to retrospective premium assessments in any policy year in which losses exceed the funds available to the insurance company. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s maximum retrospective premium assessment for the current policy period is $\n56\n million and $\n30\n million, respectively. Based on the severity of the incident, the Board of Directors of the nuclear insurer has the discretion to lower or eliminate the maximum retrospective premium assessment. The Companies have the financial responsibility for any losses that exceed the limits or for which insurance proceeds are not available because they must first be used for stabilization and decontamination. Additionally, DESC maintains an excess property insurance policy with the European Mutual Association for Nuclear Insurance. The policy provides coverage to Summer for property damage and outage costs up to $\n1\n million resulting from an event of a non-nuclear origin. The European Mutual Association for Nuclear Insurance policy permits retrospective assessments under certain conditions to cover insurer’s losses. Based on the current annual premium, DESC’s share of the retrospective premium assessment would not exceed an inconsequential amount.\n \n \nMillstone, Virginia Power and Summer also purchase accidental outage insurance from NEIL to mitigate certain expenses, including replacement power costs, associated with the prolonged outage of a nuclear unit due to direct physical damage. Under this program, the Companies are subject to a retrospective premium assessment for any policy year in which losses exceed funds available to NEIL. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s maximum retrospective premium assessment for the current policy period is $\n36\n million and $\n10\n million, respectively.\n \n \nODEC, a part owner of North Anna, Santee Cooper, a part owner of Summer and Massachusetts Municipal and Green Mountain, part owners of Millstone’s Unit 3, are responsible to the Companies for their share of the nuclear decommissioning obligation and insurance premiums on applicable units, including any retrospective premium assessments and any losses not covered by insurance.\n \n \nSpent Nuclear Fuel\n \nThe Companies entered into contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The DOE failed to begin accepting the spent fuel on January 31, 1998, the date provided by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and by the Companies’ contracts with the DOE. The Companies have previously received damages award payments and settlement payments related to these contracts.\n \n \nBy mutual agreement of the parties, the settlement agreements are extendable to provide for resolution of damages incurred after 2013. The settlement agreements for the Surry, North Anna and Millstone nuclear power stations have been extended and provided for periodic payments for damages incurred through December 31, 2025 and future additional extensions are contemplated by the settlement agreements. A similar agreement for Summer extends until the DOE has accepted the same amount of spent fuel from the facility as if it has fully performed its contractual obligations.\n \n \nIn 2024, Virginia Power received payments of $\n16\n million for resolution of claims incurred at North Anna and Surry for the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. In addition, Dominion Energy received payments of $\n11\n million for resolution of claims incurred at Millstone for the period of July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 and $\n2\n million for resolution of its share of claims incurred at Summer for the period of January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023.\n \nIn 2023, Virginia Power received payments of $\n22\n million for resolution of claims incurred at North Anna and Surry for the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. In addition, Dominion Energy received payments of $\n8\n million for resolution of claims incurred at Millstone for the period of July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 and $\n6\n million for resolution of its share of claims incurred at Summer for the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022.\n \nIn 2022, Virginia Power received payments of $\n17\n million for resolution of claims incurred at North Anna and Surry for the period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. In addition, Dominion Energy received payments of $\n7\n million \nfor resolution of claims\n \n\n\n \n188\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nincurred \nat Millstone for the period of July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 and $\n1\n million for resolution of its share of claims incurred at Summer for the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021.\n \nThe Companies continue to recognize receivables for certain spent nuclear fuel-related costs that they believe are probable of recovery from the DOE. Dominion Energy’s receivables for spent nuclear fuel-related costs totaled $\n83\n million and $\n62\n million at December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, respectively. Virginia Power’s receivables for spent nuclear fuel-related costs totaled $\n62\n million and $\n43\n million at December 31, \n2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n \nThe Companies will continue to manage their spent fuel until it is accepted by the DOE.\n \nOffshore Wind Decommissioning – Minimum Financial Assurance\n \nBOEM requires entities holding a commercial lease for offshore wind facilities to provide financial assurance, as annually determined by BOEM, for future decommission of such facilities including those under development. Decommissioning costs include removing or decommissioning all facilities, projects, cables, pipelines and obstructions, as well as clearing the seafloor of all obstructions created by activities on the leased acreage. The most recent financial assurance calculation received from BOEM for the CVOW Commercial Project, based on its expected completion, was $\n1.6\n billion. As discussed in Note 13, Virginia Power’s November 2024 application for Rider OSW filed with the Virginia Commission included a proposal for Virginia Power to establish a decommissioning trust fund associated with the CVOW Commercial Project. If approved, the applicable amount included within the total revenue requirement of Rider OSW would be allocated for such purposes.  To the extent that the minimum financial assurance requirements are not able to be met from such decommission trust funds, if approved, Virginia Power may be required to utilize parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by BOEM.\n \nLong-Term Purchase Agreements\nAt December 31, \n2024, Dominion Energy had the following long-term commitments that are noncancelable or are cancelable only under certain conditions, and that a third party has used to secure financing for the facility that will provide the contracted goods or services:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchased electric capacity\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n70\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n71\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n72\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n71\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n71\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n383\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n738\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nCommitments represent estimated amounts payable for energy under power purchase contracts with qualifying facilities which expire at various dates through 2040. Energy payments are generally based on fixed dollar amounts per month and totaled $\n60\n million and $\n58\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, respectively.\nGuarantees, Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit\n \nDominion Energy also enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries, primarily to facilitate their commercial transactions with third parties. If any of these subsidiaries fail to perform or pay under the contracts and the counterparties seek performance or payment, Dominion Energy would be obligated to satisfy such obligation. To the extent that a liability subject to a guarantee has been incurred by one of Dominion Energy’s consolidated subsidiaries, that liability is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion Energy is not required to recognize liabilities for guarantees issued on behalf of its subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that it will have to perform under the guarantees. Terms of the guarantees typically end once obligations have been paid. Dominion Energy currently believes it is unlikely that it would be required to perform or otherwise incur any losses associated with guarantees of its subsidiaries’ obligations.\n \n \nAt December 31, \n2024, Dominion Energy had issued the following subsidiary guarantees\n:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMaximum\nExposure\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity transactions\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,731\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuclear obligations\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n220\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolar\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n207\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n853\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n(5)(6)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,011\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n189\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nGuarantees related to commodity commitments of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transaction related commodities and services. \n(2)\nGuarantees primarily related to certain DGI subsidiaries regarding all aspects of running a nuclear facility.\n \n(3)\nIncludes guarantees to facilitate the development of solar projects.\n \n(4)\nGuarantees related to other miscellaneous contractual obligations such as leases, environmental obligations, construction projects and insurance programs. Due to the uncertainty of workers’ compensation claims, the parental guarantee has no stated limit. \n(5)\nExcludes Dominion Energy’s guarantee of an offshore wind installation vessel discussed in Note 15.\n(6)\nIn July 2016, Dominion Energy signed an agreement (subsequently amended) with a lessor to construct and lease a new corporate office property in Richmond, Virginia and commenced an initial five-year lease term in August 2019, with certain options at the end of the term to extend the lease, purchase or sell the property. In July 2024, the agreement was amended to reflect Dominion Energy’s election to \nextend\n the lease term through July 2029. At the end of the lease term, Dominion Energy can (i) extend the term of the lease for at least \none year\n, subject to the approval of the participants, at current market terms, (ii) purchase the property for an amount equal to the project costs or, (iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property on behalf of the lessor to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest cash purchase price for the property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors for the project costs, Dominion Energy may be required to make a payment to the lessor equal to the recorded lease balance.\nIn addition, Dominion Energy had issued an additional $\n20\n million of guarantees at December 31, 2024, primarily to support third parties. No amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded.\n \nDominion Energy also had issued four guarantees as of December 31, 2024 related to Cove Point, previously an equity method investment, in support of terminal services, transportation and construction. Two of the Cove Point guarantees have a cumulative maximum exposure of $\n1.9\n billion while the other two guarantees have no maximum limit. No amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded.\nAdditionally, at December 31, 2024\n, Dominion Energy had purchased $\n329\n million of surety bonds, including $\n259\n million at Virginia Power, and authorized the issuance of letters of credit by financial institutions, as discussed in Note 17, to facilitate commercial transactions by its subsidiaries with third parties. Under the terms of surety bonds, the Companies are obligated to indemnify the respective surety bond company for any amounts paid.\nIndemnifications\n \nAs part of commercial contract negotiations in the normal course of business, the Companies may sometimes agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may involve an adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretation of the tax law. The Companies are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of any other future payments under these contracts because events that would obligate them have not yet occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence. However, at December 31, 2024, the Companies believe any other future payments, if any, that could ultimately become payable under these contract provisions, would not have a material impact on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n \nCharitable Commitments\nDominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include $\n32\n million and $\n8\n million in other deferred credits and other liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $\n21\n million and $\n6\n million in other current liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for charitable commitments. In 2024, Dominion Energy made unconditional promises to charitable organizations and as a result recorded charges totaling $\n72\n million ($\n54\n million after-tax) in other income (expense) in its Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024 reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. These commitments are primarily to be funded at various intervals through 2028.\n \n\n\nNOTE \n24. CREDIT RISK\nDominion Energy\n \nAs a diversified energy company, Dominion Energy transacts primarily with major companies in the energy industry and with commercial and residential energy consumers. These transactions principally occur in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions of the U.S. Dominion Energy does not believe that this geographic concentration contributes significantly to its overall exposure to credit risk. In addition, as a result of its large and diverse customer base, Dominion Energy is not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk for receivables arising from electric and gas utility operations.\n \n\n\n \n190\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy’s exposure to credit risk is concentrated primarily within its energy marketing and price risk management activities, as Dominion Energy transacts with a smaller, less diverse group of counterparties and transactions may involve large notional volumes and potentially volatile commodity prices. Energy marketing and price risk management activities include marketing of nonregulated generation output, structured transactions and the use of financial contracts for enterprise-wide hedging purposes. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross credit exposure is calculated prior to the application of any collateral. At December 31, 2024\n, Dominion Energy’s credit exposure totaled $\n173\n million. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those internally rated, represented \n81\n%, and \nno\n single counterparty, whether investment grade or non-investment grade, exceeded $\n55\n million of exposure.\n \nVirginia Power\n \nVirginia Power sells electricity and provides distribution and transmission services to customers in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Management believes that this geographic concentration risk is mitigated by the diversity of Virginia Power’s customer base, which includes residential, commercial and industrial customers, as well as rural electric cooperatives and municipalities. Credit risk associated with trade accounts receivable from energy consumers is limited due to the large number of customers. Virginia Power’s exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from sales to wholesale customers. Virginia Power’s gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross credit exposure is calculated prior to the application of collateral. At December 31, 2024\n, Virginia Power’s credit exposure totaled $\n67\n million. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those internally rated, represented \n53\n%, and \nno\n single counterparty exceeded $\n10\n million of exposure.\n \nCredit-Related Contingent Provisions\n \nCertain of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s derivative instruments contain credit-related contingent provisions. These provisions require Dominion Energy and Virginia Power to provide collateral upon the occurrence of specific events, primarily a credit rating downgrade. If the credit-related contingent features underlying these instruments that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash were fully triggered, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power would have been required to post additional collateral to its counterparties of $\n13\n million and $\n12\n million, respectively, as of December 31, \n2024\n, and $\n28\n million and $\n14\n million, respectively, as of December 31, \n2023\n. The collateral that would be required to be posted includes the impacts of any offsetting asset positions and any amounts already posted for derivatives, non-derivative contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales exception, per contractual terms. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had \nno\n amounts of collateral posted related to derivatives with credit related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had both posted letters of credit as collateral with counterparties covering less than $\n1\n million of fair value of derivative instruments in a liability position at December 31, 2023. There were \nno\n letters of credits posted as collateral at December 31, 2024 for both Dominion Energy and Virginia Power. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash for Dominion Energy and Virginia Power was $\n13\n million and $\n12\n million, respectively, as of December 31, \n2024\n and $\n28\n million and $\n14\n million, respectively, as of December 31, \n2023, which does not include the impact of any offsetting asset positions.\n \nSee Note 7\n for further information about derivative instruments.\n \n\n\nNOTE \n25. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n \nDominion Energy’s transactions with equity method investments are described in Note 9. Virginia Power engages in related party transactions primarily with other Dominion Energy subsidiaries (affiliates). Virginia Power’s receivable and payable balances with affiliates are settled based on contractual terms or on a monthly basis, depending on the nature of the underlying transactions. Virginia Power is included in Dominion Energy’s consolidated federal income tax return and, where applicable, combined income tax returns for Dominion Energy are filed in various states. See Note 2 for further information. A discussion of Virginia Power’s significant related party transactions follows.\n \nVirginia Power transacts with affiliates for certain quantities of natural gas and other commodities in the ordinary course of business. Virginia Power also enters into certain commodity derivative contracts with affiliates. Virginia Power uses these contracts, which are principally comprised of forward commodity purchases, to manage commodity price risks associated with purchases of natural gas. See Note 7 for additional information. At December 31, 2024\n, Virginia Power’s derivative assets and liabilities with affiliates were $\n19\n million and $\n17\n million, respectively. At December 31, \n2023\n, Virginia Power’s derivative assets and liabilities with affiliates were $\n1\n million and $\n79\n million, respectively.\n \n\n\n \n191\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power participates in certain Dominion Energy benefit plans as described in Note 22.\n \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, Virginia Power’s amounts due to Dominion Energy associated with the Dominion Energy Pension Plan and reflected in other deferred credits and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $\n505\n million and $\n456\n million, respectively. At December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, Virginia Power’s amounts due from Dominion Energy associated with the Dominion Energy Retiree Health and Welfare Plan and reflected in noncurrent pension and other postretirement benefit assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $\n663\n million and $\n584\n million, respectively.\n \nDES and other affiliates provide accounting, legal, finance and certain administrative and technical services to Virginia Power. In addition, Virginia Power provides certain services to affiliates, including charges for facilities and equipment usage.\n \nThe financial statements for all years presented include costs for certain general, administrative and corporate expenses assigned by DES to Virginia Power on the basis of direct and allocated methods in accordance with Virginia Power’s services agreements with DES. Where costs incurred cannot be determined by specific identification, the costs are allocated based on the proportional level of effort devoted by DES resources that is attributable to the entity, determined by reference to number of employees, salaries and wages and other similar measures for the relevant DES service. Management believes the assumptions and methodologies underlying the allocation of general corporate overhead expenses are reasonable.\n \nPresented below are Virginia Power’s significant transactions with DES and other affiliates:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity purchases from affiliates\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n585\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n582\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,423\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices provided by affiliates\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n667\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n605\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n519\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices provided to affiliates\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nIncludes capitalized expenditures of $\n234\n million, $\n210\n million and $\n177\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively.\n \nVirginia Power has borrowed funds from Dominion Energy under short-term borrowing arrangements. In November 2022, Virginia Power amended its intercompany credit facility with Dominion Energy to increase the maximum capacity to $\n3.0\n billion. In addition in December 2024, Virginia Power amended this facility to extend the maturity date to \nDecember 2027\n. There were $\n500\n million in short-term demand note borrowings from Dominion Energy as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The weighted-average interest rate of these borrowings was \n4.71\n% and \n5.61\n% at December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, respectively. Virginia Power had \nno\n outstanding borrowings, net of repayments under the Dominion Energy money pool for its nonregulated subsidiaries as of December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n. Interest charges related to Virginia Power’s borrowings from Dominion Energy were $\n29\n million, $\n80\n million and $\n15\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Virginia Power declared a dividend of $\n407\n million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Virginia Power issued common stock to Dominion Energy as discussed in Note 20. There were \nno\n issuances of Virginia Power’s common stock to Dominion Energy in \n2024 or 2022.\nIn January 2023, Virginia Power entered into a lease contract with an \naffiliated entity\n for the use of a Jones Act compliant offshore wind installation vessel currently under development with commencement of the \n20-month\n lease term in \nAugust 2025\n at a total cost of approximately $\n240\n million plus ancillary services. Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission to amend the lease agreement to potentially accelerate the commencement of the lease term in August 2024 and received approval in October 2024.

Changes in and Disagreements With Acco\nuntants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\n\nNone.\n \n\n\nItem 9A. Control\ns and Procedures\n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\nSenior management of Dominion Energy, including Dominion Energy’s CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of Dominion Energy’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation process, Dominion Energy’s CEO and CFO have concluded that Dominion Energy’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Dominion Energy’s internal control over financial reporting.\n \n\n\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \n\n\nManagement of Dominion Energy understands and accepts responsibility for Dominion Energy’s financial statements and related disclosures and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (internal control). Dominion Energy continuously strives to identify opportunities to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control, just as Dominion Energy does throughout all aspects of its business.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that its assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with established procedures. This system includes written policies, an organizational structure designed to ensure appropriate segregation of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and internal audits.\n \n\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Dominion Energy, composed entirely of independent directors, meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to discuss auditing, internal control, and financial reporting matters of Dominion Energy and to ensure that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. Both the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors periodically meet alone with the Audit Committee and have free access to the Audit Committee at any time.\n \n\n\nSEC rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require Dominion Energy’s 2024 Annual Report to contain a management’s report and a report of the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of internal control. As a basis for the report, Dominion Energy tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls. Based on its assessment as of December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy makes the following assertions:\n \n\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting of Dominion Energy.\n \n\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.\n \n\n\nManagement evaluated Dominion Energy’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that Dominion Energy maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy’s independent registered public accounting firm is engaged to express an opinion on Dominion Energy’s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFebruary 27, 2025\n\n\n \n203\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Dominion Energy, Inc.\n\n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Dominion Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Dominion Energy”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, Dominion Energy maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by COSO.\n\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of Dominion Energy and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding Dominion Energy’s election to change its method of accounting for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses on its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans into earnings from an amortization approach to immediate recognition.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n \n\n\nDominion Energy’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Dominion Energy’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Dominion Energy in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\n\n\n \n\n\nRichmond, Virginia\n \n\n\nFebruary 27, 2025\n\n\n \n204\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\nSenior management of Virginia Power, including Virginia Power’s CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of Virginia Power’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation process, Virginia Power’s CEO and CFO have concluded that Virginia Power’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Virginia Power’s internal control over financial reporting.\n \n\n\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \n\n\nManagement of Virginia Power understands and accepts responsibility for Virginia Power’s financial statements and related disclosures and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (internal control). Virginia Power continuously strives to identify opportunities to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control, just as it does throughout all aspects of its business.\n \n\n\nVirginia Power maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that its assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with established procedures. This system includes written policies, an organizational structure designed to ensure appropriate segregation of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and internal audits.\n \n\n\nThe Board of Directors also serves as Virginia Power’s Audit Committee and meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to discuss Virginia Power’s auditing, internal accounting control and financial reporting matters and to ensure that each is properly discharging its responsibilities.\n \n\n\nSEC rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require Virginia Power’s 2024 Annual Report to contain a management’s report regarding the effectiveness of internal control. As a basis for the report, Virginia Power tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls. Based on the assessment as of December 31, 2024, Virginia Power makes the following assertions:\n \n\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting of Virginia Power.\n\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.\n \n\n\nManagement evaluated Virginia Power’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that Virginia Power maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\n \n\n\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of Virginia Power’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report is not subject to attestation by Virginia Power’s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to a permanent exemption under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFebruary 27, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n205\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nItem 9B.
