In 2024, the Company announced further restructuring actions to take advantage of additional opportunities related to the activities described above\n. \nStrengths\nMarket Position\nMohawk’s fashionable and innovative products, successful participation in all sales channels, creative marketing tools and programs and extensive sales resources have enabled the Company to build market leadership positions in multiple geographies, primarily North America, Europe, Latin America and Australasia, as well as to export products to approximately 180 countries. In North America, Mohawk’s largest marketplace, the Company has leveraged its brands, broad offering and award-winning merchandising to build strong positions across all product categories. In Europe, similar advantages have supported market leadership in ceramic tile, premium laminate and sheet vinyl. The Company also has established a strong position in the fast-growing LVT market in the United States and Europe, with investments to expand capacity and align the product offering with market trends. In 2023, the Company further expanded its presence in Brazil through the acquisition of Elizabeth Revestimentos, a leading Brazilian ceramic tile business with four manufacturing facilities strategically located throughout that country. In 2023, the Company also acquired Vitromex, a leading Mexican ceramic tile business with four manufacturing facilities strategically located throughout that country, further solidifying the Company’s position in the Mexico ceramic tile market.\nProduct Innovation\nMohawk drives performance through innovation and process improvements across all product categories. In ceramic, this includes proprietary Reveal Imaging\n®\n printing that replicates the appearance of other surfaces, such as long planks with the visuals and texture of natural wood as well as tiles that mimic natural stone, cement, textiles and other alternatives. The Company has pioneered an innovative ceramic tile technology called StepWise™ that is infused into its top-quality porcelain tile to significantly improve slip resistance. Given the frequent use of ceramic tile in kitchens and baths, the Company has also introduced numerous collections featuring antimicrobial treatment that becomes a permanent part of the product. The Company \n5\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nmanufactures large-scale porcelain slabs that can replicate the look of natural stone but are harder and more durable. In addition to satisfying demand for their domestic markets, porcelain slabs produced in Europe are also exported to North America, where along with the Company’s quartz countertop and natural stone slab offerings they provide customers with a comprehensive array of surface options. \nIn carpet, the Company’s proprietary fiber technologies include SmartStrand\n®\n and its brand extensions, which are made in part with annually renewable plant-based materials and were the first super-soft stain-resistant products on the market. In the fast-growing polyester carpet category, the Company’s patented Continuum™ process adds bulk and softness to polyester fiber, differentiating the Company’s products in the market. The Company has also launched an innovative carpet backing called Recover™ that is hypoallergenic, latex and VOC free and is easier to install and seam.\nIn laminate, the Company’s patented Uniclic\n®\n installation technology revolutionized the category and has been adapted into the LVT and wood categories, as well. The Company continues to deliver new innovations such as unique HydroSeal™ water-resistance that has extended the laminate category into kitchens and baths, more realistic visuals with GenuEdge\n®\n pressed bevel edges and surface embossing in register that precisely recreates the appearance of wood. As consumer preference for water-proof flooring has increased, the Company has introduced a propriety technology called WetProtect™ that makes the joints of installed laminate and LVT water tight and prevents liquid spills from reaching the subfloor.\nThe Company’s resilient flooring products reflect significant investments in leading-edge technology that yield incredibly realistic reproductions of stone, wood and other materials with embossed finishes that create more realistic visuals. To complement the beauty of its LVT collections, the Company has also enhanced the performance of its premium rigid products with a stone-plastic composite core and an enhanced lacquer finish to provide a dent proof, scratch resistant surface that can withstand today’s active family homes. The Company has recently introduced two PVC-free water-proof flooring options: PureTech™, a sustainable alternative that incorporates 70% recycled content and Solid Tech R™, \n \nwhich utilizes ten recycled plastic bottles per square foot. \nOperational Excellence\nMohawk’s highly efficient manufacturing and distribution assets serve as the foundation for successful growth. By leveraging continuous process improvement and automation, the Company’s operations drive innovation, quality and value. Through its commitment to sustainability practices, the Company has also optimized natural resources and raw materials. The Company has invested to expand capacity, introduce differentiated new products and improve efficiencies. In particular, the Company’s capital investments have improved recently acquired businesses by upgrading product offerings, expanding distribution and improving productivity. \nForbes\n has designated Mohawk as one of the Best Large United States Employers and \nTraining Magazine\n ranked the Company’s training and development programs among the best for more than fifteen years.\nSustainability\nMohawk’s sustainability strategy is founded on three pillars: Better for People, Better for the Planet, and Better for Performance. Through the Better for People pillar, the Company focuses on employee engagement, health and well-being, workforce development, a \nZero-Harm Workplace\n \nand community engagement initiatives.\n \nHighlights of this pillar include Mohawk Group’s \nArtLifting\n \npartnership working with artists with disabilities to include their designs in commercial flooring collections and an extensive internal training initiative from the plant floor to the C-suite. In the United States and Mexico, the Company operates on-site, near-site and virtual Healthy Life Centers to assist employees and their eligible family members with management of chronic conditions as well as treatment of acute illness. Through the Better for the Planet pillar, Mohawk focuses on a climate-positive future through energy conservation, water restoration and product circularity, including waste reduction and responsible sourcing. The Company uses extensive recycled content in many of its products, including transforming billions of discarded plastic bottles annually to create polyester carpet fiber, millions of pounds of recycled and reclaimed wood annually into laminate flooring, chipboards and decorative panels, and millions of pounds of tires annually to produce decorative crumb rubber mats. The Company also produces energy through solar panels, windmills and a waste-to-energy program using scrap wood material. In 2023 and 2024, \nUSA Today\n included Mohawk in its first two lists of America’s Climate Leaders, companies that are making the largest reductions in their carbon emissions. Through the Better for Performance pillar, the Company focuses on sustainability initiatives, ethics, data security and privacy, including creating and maintaining sustainability-related policies. \nMohawk’s annual Impact Report sets forth the Company’s initiatives with respect to these pillars and details how the Company works to manage its operations responsibly and ethically. The Impact Report includes Mohawk’s environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) policies and practices on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, Board and management sustainability oversight, governance and ethics, environmental sustainability, climate change and greenhouse gas \n6\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nemissions reduction and employee health and safety management. The scope of the Board’s Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee responsibilities includes oversight of Mohawk’s sustainability programs, and the scope of the Board’s Audit Committee responsibilities includes oversight of climate-related risks.

The Company has long-term clay mining rights in Brazil, Bulgaria, North America and Russia that satisfy a portion of its clay requirements for producing tile. The Company also purchases a number of different grades of clay for the manufacture of its tile. Glazes are used on a significant percentage of manufactured tiles. Glazes consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit being the largest component. The Company manufactures a significant amount of its frit requirements. The Company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of clay, talc and industrial minerals that are readily available from a number of independent sources. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the Company’s requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available. \nFlooring NA\nThe principal raw materials used in the production of carpet are polyester, triexta, nylon, polypropylene, caprolactam, recycled post-consumer plastics, synthetic backing materials, latex and various dyes and chemicals, the majority of which are petroleum-based.

The market for raw materials is sensitive to temporary disruptions. \n9\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nIndustry and Competition\nThe Company is the largest flooring manufacturer in a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies ranging from small, privately-held firms to large multinationals. In 2023, the United States floor covering industry reported $34.1 billion in sales, down approximately 7.4% over 2022’s sales of $36.8 billion.  In 2023, the primary categories of flooring in the United States, based on sales, were carpet and rugs (33.3%), resilient consisting of LVT, sheet vinyl and various other resilient categories (33.0%), ceramic tile (12.6%), wood (11.9%), stone (5.9%) and laminate (3.3%). In 2023, the primary categories of flooring in the United States, based on square feet sold, were resilient consisting of LVT, sheet vinyl and various other resilient categories (39.7%), carpet and rugs (39.5%), ceramic tile (11.4%), wood (5.0%), laminate (3.0%) and stone (1.4%).  Each of these categories is influenced by the residential and commercial construction and residential and commercial remodeling end-use markets. These markets are influenced by many factors including changing consumer preferences, consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, inflation, availability of credit, turnover in housing and the overall strength of the economy.\nThe principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are product innovation, style, quality, price, performance technology and service. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important when competing among product lines. The Company actively seeks to differentiate its products in the marketplace by introducing innovative products with premium features that provide a superior value proposition. The Company’s investments in manufacturing technology, computer systems and distribution networks, as well as the Company’s marketing strategies and resources, contribute to its ability to compete on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than price.\nGlobal Ceramic\nGlobally, the ceramic tile industry is significantly fragmented, though the Company believes it is the world’s largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in specific markets, including Europe, Russia and the United States, as well as maintaining leading positions in the Brazilian and Mexican markets. The Company has leveraged the advantages of its scale, product innovation and unique designs in these markets to solidify its leadership position, however the Company continues to face pressures in these markets from imported ceramic products as well as alternate flooring categories. Certain regions around the world have established sufficient capacity to allow them to meet domestic needs in addition to exporting product to other markets where their cost, design and/or technical advantages may drive consumer preferences. Some mature markets have seen industry consolidation driven by mergers and acquisitions; however, most markets are comprised of many relatively small manufacturers all working with similar technologies, raw materials and designs. During 2023, the estimated global capacity for ceramic tile was 171 billion square feet – down 5.5% from the prior year primarily due to inflation, an energy crisis, higher interest rates and the resulting slowing demand for flooring that began in the second half of 2022 – with selling prices varying widely based on many factors, including supply within the market, materials used, size, shape and design. While the Company operates ceramic manufacturing facilities in eight countries, the Company has leveraged advantages in technology, design, brand recognition and marketing to extend exports of its products to approximately 160 countries. As a result of this global sales strategy, the Company faces competition in the ceramic tile market from a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers, all of which compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers through multiple residential and commercial channels. \nFlooring NA\nThe North American flooring industry is highly competitive, with an increasing variety of product categories, shifting consumer preferences, supply chain disruptions and pressures from imported products, particularly in the rug and hard surface categories. Based on industry publications, in 2023, the United States flooring industry had carpet and rug sales of approximately $11.4 billion out of the overall $34.1 billion market. Based on its 2023 net sales, the Company believes it is the largest producer of rugs and the second largest producer of carpet in the world. The Company differentiates its carpet collections in the marketplace through proprietary fiber systems, state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and unique styling as well as leveraging the strength of some of the best-known brands in the industry. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer and distributor of laminate flooring in the United States. The Company’s leading position in laminate flooring is driven by the strength of its premium brands as well as technical innovations such as water resistance, realistic visuals, beveled edges, deeply embossed in register surfaces and patented installation technologies. The United States resilient industry is highly competitive, and according to industry publications, grew more than 8.2% in 2023. Based on industry publications, in 2023, LVT, sheet vinyl and other various resilient categories generated sales of $11.3 billion out of the $34.1 billion total United States flooring market. The Company believes that it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of LVT and sheet vinyl in the United States. The Company’s sheet vinyl operations produce fiberglass backed products, which have proven more popular with consumers in the past several years due to superior performance and durability. The Company has expanded its resilient product portfolio to include a renewable polymer core (RPC) category and a stone polymer core (SPC) category made \n10\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nwith recycled plastic bottles, both of which are a PVC-free alternatives to traditional resilient products while maintaining waterproof capabilities and exceeding the scratch resistance of traditional LVT.  \nFlooring ROW\nThe Company faces competition in the non-U.S. laminate, wood, LVT and sheet vinyl flooring business from a large number of domestic manufacturers as well as pressures from imports. The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of laminate flooring in the world, with a focus on premium products, which the Company supplies under some of the best-known and most widely marketed brands in its regions. In addition, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage in its laminate flooring markets as a result of the Company’s industry-leading water resistance, realistic visuals and embossed-in-register surfaces as well as patented installation technologies, all of which allow the Company to differentiate its products in the areas of design, performance, installation and assembly. The Company faces competition in the non-U.S. vinyl flooring channel from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers, but believes it has a competitive advantage in its LVT and sheet vinyl markets due to industry-leading design, patented technologies, brand recognition and vertical integration. The Company has elevated the performance of its sheet vinyl collections and is now aggressively placing the product in commercial applications. The Company also extended its sheet vinyl business into Eastern Europe with the acquisition of Polish-based Lentex Flooring. After initially extending its geographic footprint by acquiring national hard surface distributors in Australia and New Zealand, the Company acquired Godfrey Hirst, making the Company the largest manufacturer of carpet in both countries. The Company has integrated its Australasian soft and hard surface businesses to provide a comprehensive offering to residential and commercial customers in the region. In Australia and New Zealand, the Company faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers, but believes it has a competitive advantage in its carpet and hard surface offering due to industry-leading design, patented technologies, brand recognition and vertical integration of manufacturing and distribution. Through the acquisitions of Xtratherm and of Ballytherm, the Company has extended its insulation business to the United Kingdom and Ireland while expanding sales in its core Benelux Region. The Company also increased its European wood panels business by acquiring German-based Berghoef and Otto Schneider (mezzanine flooring) and French-based Panneaux De Corrèze (MDF). \nPatents and Trademarks\nIntellectual property is important to the Company’s business and the Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect its interests.

The Company’s cybersecurity program is led by its Senior Director of Cybersecurity, who functions as the chief information security officer (“CISO”).  \nThe Company’s cybersecurity program interfaces with other functional areas within the Company, including but not limited to the Company’s business segments and information technology (“IT”), legal, risk management, human resources and internal audit departments, as well as external third-party partners, to identify and understand potential cybersecurity threats.  The Company regularly assesses and updates its policies, processes, procedures and controls in light of ongoing cybersecurity developments.\n \nInternally, the CISO coordinates oversight of reviewing security alerts, identifying and monitoring ongoing and potential cybersecurity threats, evaluating strategic business impacts of cybersecurity threats and developing programs and initiatives to educate the Company’s employees regarding cybersecurity.  The CISO also manages the Company’s Computer Security Incident Response Plan (the “Incident Response Plan”), which outlines action steps for the preparation, identification, triage, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery and reflection stages of a cybersecurity incident. The Incident Response Plan serves as the charter for the Company’s Computer Security Incident Response Team (the “Incident Response Team”), which includes a strategic team comprised of executives from various cross-functional management teams, as well as a tactical team comprised of internal technical support roles and external third-party service providers. The Incident Response Plan provides how the Incident Response Team will analyze and, as necessary, escalate cybersecurity incidents both internally and with third-party service providers based on type and severity of the specific incident.\nThe CISO also oversees the Company’s management of third-party service providers.\n \nThe Company has engaged a third-party managed detection and response company to monitor the security of its information systems, including intrusion detection, and to provide timely alerts if a cybersecurity event occurs.\n The Company also has engaged a third-party digital forensics and incident response consultant on retainer.\nThe Company also requires cybersecurity training for certain employees, focusing on the appropriate protection and security of confidential company and third-party information. Additionally, the Company provides annual cybersecurity awareness training that covers a broad range of security topics, which may include secure access practice, phishing schemes, remote work and response to suspicious activities.
