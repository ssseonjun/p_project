    "item1": "Item 1.    Business \nThe following description of the business should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. This description contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements due to the factors set forth in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nCboe Global Markets, Inc., the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions to people around the world. Cboe provides trading solutions and products in multiple asset classes, including equities, derivatives, and FX, across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Above all, the Company is committed to building a trusted, inclusive global marketplace that enables people to pursue a sustainable financial future. \nCboe’s subsidiaries include the largest options exchange and the third largest equities exchange operator in the U.S. In addition, the Company operates Cboe Europe, one of the largest equities exchanges by value traded in Europe, and owns Cboe Clear Europe, a leading pan-European equities and derivatives clearinghouse, BIDS Holdings, which owns a leading block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S., and provides block-trading services with Cboe market operators in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan, Cboe Australia, an operator of trading venues in Australia, Cboe Japan, an operator of trading venues in Japan, Cboe Clear U.S., an operator of a regulated clearinghouse, and Cboe Canada Inc., a recognized Canadian securities exchange. Cboe subsidiaries also serve collectively as a leading market globally for exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) listings and trading. \nThe graphic below provides a brief overview of Cboe’s history:\n7\nTable \no\nf Contents\nOur Business \nCboe reports on the following six business segments:\n•\nOptions.\n The Options segment includes options on market indices (“index options”), as well as on the stocks of individual corporations (“equity options”) and on ETPs such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”), which are “multi-listed” options and listed on a non-exclusive basis. These options are eligible to trade, as applicable, on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and/or other U.S. national security exchanges. Cboe Options is the Company’s primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on the Cboe Options trading floor in Chicago. C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options are all-electronic options exchanges, and typically operate with different market models and fee structures than Cboe Options. The Options segment also includes applicable market data fees revenues generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary options market data, index licensing, routing services, and access and capacity services.\n•\nNorth American Equities. \nThe North American Equities segment includes U.S. equities and ETP transaction services that occur on fully electronic exchanges owned and operated by BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platform in the U.S. and Canada, and Canadian equities and other transaction services that occur on or through Cboe Canada Inc.’s order books. The North American Equities segment also includes corporate listing services on Cboe Canada Inc., ETP listings on BZX, the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. common stock listing, and applicable market data fees revenues generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary equities market data, routing services, and access and capacity services.\n•\nEurope and Asia Pacific.\n The Europe and Asia Pacific segment includes the pan-European listed equities and derivatives transaction services, ETPs, including exchange traded funds, exchange traded notes, and exchange traded commodities, and international depository receipts that are hosted on MTFs operated by Cboe Europe Equities (Cboe Europe and Cboe NL equities exchanges) and Cboe Europe Derivatives (“CEDX”). It also includes the ETP listings business on RMs and clearing activities of Cboe Clear Europe, as well as the equities transaction services of Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan, operators of trading venues in Australia and Japan, respectively, along with equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platform in Australia and Japan. Cboe Europe operates lit and dark books, a periodic auctions book, a closing cross book, and two BIDS orderbooks; a Large-in-Scale (“LIS”) trading negotiation facility and - predominantly for UK and Swiss symbols - a volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) trajectory crossing facility. Cboe NL, based in Amsterdam, operates similar business functionality to that offered by Cboe Europe (with exception of Trajectory Crossing), and provides for trading only in European Economic Area (“EEA”) symbols. Cboe Europe Derivatives, a pan-European derivatives platform, offers futures and options based on Cboe Europe equity indices, and single stock options. Cboe Clear Europe offers the clearing of equity and equity-like instruments for Cboe-operated and other regulated trading venues, the clearing of derivative transactions executed on CEDX, and has recently introduced a service to clear Securities Financing Transactions. This segment also includes Cboe Europe, Cboe NL, CEDX, Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\n•\nFutures.\n The Futures segment includes transaction services provided by CFE, a fully electronic futures exchange, which includes offerings for trading of VIX futures and other futures products, the licensing of proprietary market data, as well as access and capacity services. On April 25, 2024, the Company announced plans to transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to CFE in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review.\n•\nGlobal FX.\n The Global FX segment includes institutional FX trading services that occur on the Cboe FX fully electronic trading platform, non-deliverable forward FX transactions (“NDFs”) offered for execution on Cboe SEF, as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services. The segment includes transaction services for U.S. government securities executed on the Cboe Fixed Income fully electronic trading platform.\n•\nDigital.\n The Digital segment includes a regulated futures exchange (Cboe Digital Exchange) and a regulated clearinghouse (Cboe Clear U.S.), as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services. Prior to May 31, 2024, the Digital segment also included a U.S.-based spot digital asset trading market (“Cboe Digital spot market”). As of May 31, 2024, the Cboe Digital spot market is closed for all participant and trading purposes. In addition, the Company plans to transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to CFE in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review. The Company expects that Digital will cease to be a distinct reportable business segment in the first quarter of 2025.\n8\nTable \no\nf Contents\nCboe also presents three financial statement revenue captions that reflect the Company’s diversified products,  expansive geographical reach, and overall business strategy. Below is a summary of Cboe’s financial statement revenue  caption businesses:\n•\nCash and spot markets. \nThis includes associated transaction and clearing fees on our equities and FX markets and clearing business, the portion of market data fees relating to associated U.S. tape plan market data fees, associated regulatory fees, and associated other revenue from Cboe’s North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Global FX, and Digital segments. The key sources of these revenues are our equities and FX markets, the U.S. tape plans, and our clearing and listings businesses, which are described in more detail below.\n•\nCboe Data Vantage (f/k/a Data and Access Solutions, subsequently referred to as Data Vantage).\n The Cboe Data Vantage business includes access and capacity fees to our markets, proprietary market data fees from various licensing agreements and proprietary indices, and associated other revenue across Cboe’s six segments.

Cboe delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions across the globe through a comprehensive ecosystem that helps drive innovation and growth.\nStrategic Focus\nOur strategy is to build one of the world’s largest global derivatives and securities networks to create value and drive growth by:\n•\nInvesting in the continued growth of our core business in Global Derivatives;\n•\nEnhancing recurring revenue opportunities through Cboe Data Vantage (f/k/a Data and Access Solutions);\n•\nHarnessing our global network to expand product reach & access;\n•\nCapitalizing on the demand for access to the U.S. capital markets;\n•\nLeveraging our superior technology to drive innovations; and\n•\nAllocating capital and resources to areas where we expect to see the strongest long-term returns for shareholders.\nKey Business Highlights\nThe following is a brief summary of our key 2024 business highlights:\n•\nLaunched new products and indices such as cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether Futures, Options on VIX Futures, Cboe S&P 500 Variance Futures, Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index and options thereon, and U.S. Treasury Market Volatility Index.\n•\nEnhanced existing collaborations with S&P Dow Jones Indices with plans to launch the Cboe S&P 500 Constituent Volatility Index.\n•\nDrove FTSE Russell innovation in digital asset derivatives and with MSCI to offer new index options and volatility indices.\n•\nWorked to expand retail access to index options.\n•\nIntroduced dedicated cores in our equities markets.\n•\nBuilt out our technology offerings in each of the U.S. and our international markets.\n•\nIntroduced a central counterparty clearing service for European SFT.\n10\nTable \no\nf Contents\n•\nContinued to expand our geographic footprint with a minority stake in Japannext Co., Ltd.\n•\nReallocated technology resources from integration efforts to organic revenue opportunities.\n•\nRealigned the digital asset business to leverage our core strengths in derivatives, technology and product innovation. \nDerivatives Markets\nWe are one of the largest U.S. derivatives market operators, operating four options markets, Cboe Options, BZX Options, EDGX Options and C2 Options, operating a futures market, CFE, as well as operating a pan-European derivatives market, Cboe Europe Derivatives (“CEDX”). The key products traded on our derivatives markets are proprietary products, including our flagship products SPX options and VIX options and futures, and multi-listed products. \nOur U.S. derivatives options market, Cboe Options, is a hybrid market combining open outcry floor trading with electronic trading. For multi-listed products, depending on the product, we utilize public customer priority, market turner, participation rights and pro-rata allocation market models, as well as the “classic” pricing model (known as payment for order flow). For proprietary products, we use price-time or pro-rata allocation, alongside public customer priority in certain instances, and market turner, combined with a pricing model where all market participants generally pay fees. Our other three options markets, BZX, EDGX and C2, are fully electronic and utilize a mix of price-time, customer priority, participation rights, pro-rata allocation, maker-taker and classic pricing market models.\nCFE’s U.S. derivatives futures market, which is fully electronic, utilizes a price-time market model, combined with a pricing model where all market participants generally pay fees, subject to specified exceptions.\nCEDX, which is fully electronic, utilizes a pro-rata allocation market model.\nProprietary Products\nWe are a leader in the volatility space with the volatility-based proprietary products we offer for trading. These volatility-based proprietary products are built through Cboe Labs, a dedicated team centered on the creation, development, and implementation of new ideas and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers, which are both described below in further detail. We offer proprietary products on our proprietary indices and indices owned by other index providers. Our most frequently traded proprietary products include SPX options and VIX options and futures.\nSPX Options\nThe S&P 500 Index is an index comprised of 500 large-cap U.S. listed companies. It is one of the most commonly followed indices and is considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy. The SPX options we offer on the S&P 500 Index are exclusive to Cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fee revenues. Because of the S&P 500 Index’s status as a bellwether, SPX options are used in many different trading strategies by customers with different goals, including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options, asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using risk-managed strategies to capture so-called “risk premia” embedded in option prices. We also offer zero days to expiry (0-DTE) products, Long Term Equity AnticiPation Securities (LEAPs), Mini- and Nano-SPX options, FLEX- and FLEX micro-SPX options, and SPX Weeklys options, which have settlements on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and on the last trading day of each month and 24x5 trading in SPX options. We believe these additional expirations provide customers with more precision when hedging overall portfolio risk. \nVolatility Trading\nCboe pioneered the trading of exchange-traded volatility products with its introduction of VIX futures in 2004 and VIX options in 2006. The VIX Index (as defined below), although not directly tradable, is based on the mid-point of real-time quotes of SPX options and is designed to reflect investors’ consensus view of future 30-day expected stock market volatility. The VIX Index methodology provides the basis for the creation of VIX options and futures. The final settlement value of VIX options and futures is determined on their expiration date through a Special Opening Quotation (“SOQ”) of the VIX Index. The SOQ calculation uses opening trade prices of selected options; unless there is no opening price, in which case the opening price used in the SOQ calculation is the midpoint of the highest bid and lowest offer at the time of the opening. Since we started offering these products, we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies, including hedging extreme stock market declines, also known as “tail risk” hedging, and risk-managed strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future.\nTo help investors better manage market volatility, we also offer the 1-Day Volatility Index (VIX1D), the U.S. Treasury Market Volatility Index (VIXTLT), VIX Weeklys options and futures, mini VIX futures, nearly 24x5 trading in VIX options and futures, Cboe S&P 500 Variance Futures, and Options on VIX futures.\n11\nTable \no\nf Contents\nProprietary Indices\nWe also calculate and disseminate proprietary indices that are licensed for use by third parties or are used as the basis for Cboe proprietary products. These proprietary indices are built through our in-house Cboe Labs research and development and Cboe Data Vantage business teams, often in connection with our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers, which are both described below in further detail. Our proprietary indices include:\n•\nvolatility indices based on broad-based market indices, such as the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000, \n•\nvolatility indices based on ETFs,\n•\nindices based on Bitcoin ETFs, and\n•\noptions strategy benchmark indices, such as the Cboe BuyWrite, PutWrite, and Collar indices based on the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, BuyWrite and PutWrite indices based on MSCI EAFE and MSCI Emerging Markets indices, and BuyWrite indices based on other broad-based market indices.\nIn addition to any transaction fee revenue generated from trading of products based on these indices on Cboe exchanges, we distribute these indices through the Cboe Global Index Feed index data subscription service and, together with index providers with whom we have strategic relationships, we license proprietary indices for third parties to use to create third-party indices and products. Accordingly, we generate revenue from proprietary indices by distributing them for reference purposes, using them as the basis for proprietary products and licensing them for use for third-party indices and products. \nIndex Provider Relationships\nThe Company has long-term business relationships with several providers of market indices. We license their indices, including on an exclusive basis, as the foundation for indices, index options and other products. The Company also has agreements in place to work jointly with key providers to develop new indices and products and services that are expected to capitalize on our core competencies and diversify our sources of revenue. Of particular note are the following: \n•\nS&P Dow Jones Indices (“S&P”). \nWe have the following licensing arrangements with S&P:\n◦\nS&P Indices. \nWe have the exclusive right to offer exchange-listed options contracts in the United States on the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 100 Index, the S&P 500 ESG Index, and the S&P Select Sector Indices as a result of a licensing arrangement with S&P. Our license from S&P is through December 31, 2033, with an exclusive license to trade options on the S&P 500 Index through December 31, 2032. We use the market data from the trading of options on the S&P 500 Index and S&P 100 Index for the creation of Cboe volatility indices, such as the Cboe Volatility Index (“VIX Index”), and to create tradable products on those volatility indices\n.\n◦\nMarkit Indices.\n We have a worldwide license through August 22, 2025 to offer futures, options, and options on futures on indices designed to reflect values of investment grade and high-yield U.S. corporate bonds. Unless either party elects otherwise, this agreement auto-renews for successive two-year periods. Pursuant to our license, we offer futures and options on futures on high yield and investment grade corporate bond indices.\n◦\nDow Jones Indices. \nWe have the exclusive right during standard U.S. trading hours to offer listed options contracts in the United States on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow 10 Index, and non-exclusive rights to offer listed options on several other Dow Jones indices including the Dow Jones Utilities Average and Dow Jones Transportation Average. This licensing arrangement extends through December 31, 2033. We use market data from the trading of options on these indices to create Cboe volatility indices, variance indicators and BuyWrite indices, and we trade options and other products on these indices.\n•\nFTSE Russell. \nUnder our license agreement with the London Stock Exchange Group’s (“LSEG”) leading global index franchises, Frank Russell Company and FTSE International Limited (together “FTSE Russell”), we have the exclusive or first right in the United States to offer listed options on more than two dozen FTSE Russell indices, which represent a diverse group of domestic and global equities with international appeal. Our exclusive license from FTSE Russell is through April 1, 2030. We offer options on the Russell 2000, Russell 1000, Russell 1000 Value and Russell 1000 Growth indices and mini-options on the Russell 2000 Index.\n•\nMSCI\n. \nWe have an agreement with MSCI Inc. (“MSCI”) in which we have the right to offer U.S.-listed options on several of MSCI’s indices including the MSCI EAFE, MSCI Emerging Markets, MSCI World, MSCI ACWI, and MSCI USA indices. The agreement term extends until December 31, 2031, but our license to list options on the MSCI indices contained in the agreement could expire on September 30, 2026 if either party elects not to extend. We use \n12\nTable \no\nf Contents\nmarket data from the trading of the MSCI EAFE and MSCI Emerging Markets index options (among other inputs) to calculate volatility indices and several versions of BuyWrite and PutWrite strategy indices.\nCboe Data Vantage\nThe Cboe Data Vantage business provides an offering of market data and information solutions products across multiple asset classes and geographic regions that are designed to suit our customers’ diverse needs. The Cboe Data Vantage business consists of three product groups:\n•\nMarket Data and Access Services.\n Data products include real-time depth of book quotation information, auction and complex option information, top of book quotes and trades, last sale information, and consolidated equity feeds. Our market data offerings include proprietary data derived from our derivatives and cash and spot markets as well as data relating to Cboe’s proprietary products, such as VIX futures.

Fees, net of plan costs, from UTP, CTA, and OPRA are allocated and distributed to plan participants like us according to their share of tape fees based on a formula, required by Regulation NMS, which may take into account both trading and quoting activity. \nCash and Spot Markets\nWe are one of the largest equities market operators, operating four U.S. equities exchanges, international exchanges in Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia, as well as a number of alternative trading systems and an FX platform.\nOur four U.S. equities exchanges, BZX, EDGX, BYX and EDGA, which are fully electronic, operate various market and pricing models including price-time, and price-time with retail priority, as well as various pricing models, including maker-taker and taker-maker fee structures. In addition to these market models, each of the U.S. equity exchanges provides numerous specific order types that are designed to enhance their respective market models.\nBIDS Trading, the U.S. equities ATS market, which is fully electronic and is an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the Exchanges, utilizes a sponsored access model to provide anonymous executions in NMS stocks. Cboe and BIDS Trading collaborate in operating similar venues with our cash and spot markets in Australia, Canada, Europe, and Japan.\nOur fully electronic Canadian securities exchange, Cboe Canada Inc., offers four order books, NEO-L, NEO-N, NEO-D and MATCHNow, which operate various market models including maker-taker, taker-maker, large order priority, and frequent call matches with continuous execution opportunities, among others.\nIn Europe, we operate a number of market models, including continuous Lit orderbooks, periodic auction orderbooks, dark midpoint orderbooks, a post-closing cross, as well as two BIDS Europe orderbooks.\n13\nTable \no\nf Contents\nCboe Australia is a regulated stock exchange that is fully electronic. Cboe Australia utilizes a model that charges a different ad valorem fee rate depending on whether a participant is making or taking liquidity.\nCboe Japan offers two fully electronic displayed markets, Cboe-Alpha and Cboe-Select. Cboe Japan also offers two fully electronic non-displayed markets, Cboe-Match, which matches VWAP orders during pre-market hours and Cboe BIDS Japan, which utilizes a price-time market model aiming for primary market mid-point trades.\nThe Cboe FX platform provides institutional FX trading services and utilizes a price-firmness-time priority market model. For our FX NDF markets, Cboe SEF utilizes a price-firmness-time priority market model.\nListing\nCboe operates five listing venues across the globe that are structured and designed, in the U.S. and Canada, for all types of equity instruments, such as ETPs, corporate securities, warrants and depositary receipts, while in the UK and European Union (\"EU\") they support ETPs only. In Australia, both ETPs and warrants are supported. Over the course of 2024, Cboe added approximately 730 listings across the globe and had approximately 2,460 listings as of December 31, 2024. Cboe also offers intralisting on its different equities markets through Cboe Global Listings, the first-of-its-kind, global listing network facilitating worldwide access to capital and secondary liquidity for companies and ETFs.\nClearing\nOur subsidiary Cboe Clear Europe, a European central counterparty (“CCP”), provides post-trade clearing services, to stock exchanges, multilateral trading facilities and for over-the-counter equities trades and exchange-traded derivatives trades. Cboe Clear Europe acts as a central counterparty that, for its clearing participants, becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. As a result, it guarantees the timely performance of the settlement obligations of buyers and sellers and takes on the risk of the performance of the transactions that it clears. Additionally, as a Financial Market Infrastructure, Cboe Clear Europe is subject to strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight. Cboe Clear Europe clears equities and equity like instruments traded on 47 European trading segments. Cboe Clear Europe also clears equity derivative instruments traded on Cboe NL. In 2024, Cboe Clear Europe provided CCP protection for an average of €49 billion of cleared value on a daily basis. Through the process of netting, in 2024, Cboe Clear Europe eliminated 70%, or €34 billion of the average daily cleared value, leaving an average daily settlement value of €15 billion. In 2023, Cboe Clear Europe provided CCP protection for an average of €44 billion of cleared value on a daily basis. Through the process of netting, in 2023, Cboe Clear Europe eliminated 71%, or €31 billion of the average daily cleared value, leaving an average daily settlement value of €13 billion. As of November 25, 2024, Cboe Clear Europe also launched a first-of-its-kind service for SFT in cash equities and ETFs, which includes central clearing, settlement and post-trade lifecycle management.\nCboe Clear U.S. is a CFTC-registered derivatives clearing organization (“DCO”) that provides clearing and settlement of cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts for its affiliate, Cboe Digital Exchange.\nCustomers\nOur customers generally include financial institutions, trading platforms, institutional and individual investors, and professional traders. Our equities and options customers in the United States include trading permit holders and members (as applicable) of Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, which are SEC-registered broker-dealers, and the customers of those broker-dealers.

For information regarding risks related to our customers see “Risk Factors.”\nCompetition\nThe industry in which we operate is intensely competitive. We believe we face competition on a number of factors, including: \n•\nprice, quality and speed of our trade and clearing execution; \n14\nTable \no\nf Contents\n•\nfunctionality and ease of use of our trading and clearing platforms; \n•\nreliability, integrity, depth of book, liquidity, range and functionality of our products and services;\n•\nintegrity of our marketplaces; \n•\ntechnological innovation and adoption;\n•\nour brand awareness; and \n•\nour reputation. \nWe believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors through a variety of methods, including:\n•\noffering access to a broad array of products and services, including proprietary products and market data;\n•\noffering fee schedules and pricing models that both attract order flow and provide incentives to liquidity providers; \n•\nproviding advanced technology that offers broad functionality, low latency, fast execution, ease of use, scalability, reliability, and security; \n•\noffering efficient, transparent and liquid marketplaces; \n•\noffering deep and liquid markets with opportunities for price improvement;\n•\noffering broad trading platform access in the EU;\n•\noffering efficient and transparent clearing services designed to help maximize netting opportunities;\n•\nmaintaining close relationships with customers; and \n•\nproviding customers with a comprehensive source of information on options and ETPs as well as extensive options education. \nIn our proprietary products, we compete against other futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products, as well as against financial market participants that offer similar over-the-counter derivatives. We also compete against certain multi-listed options products, such as SPY options and cash settled index options, which may offer similar market exposure of our proprietary products, such as SPX options.\nThe listed options industry is extremely competitive. As of December 31, 2024, our four options exchanges compete with 14 other U.S. options exchanges, in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology. Most of the equity and ETP options listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on the other exchanges. In addition, the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multi-listed options business to their exchanges, which has historically reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multi-listed options, and the options exchanges that we compete with structure their options businesses in partnership with established market participants, such as consolidators, and other order flow providers, to increase their volume traded.\nOur U.S. equities and the BIDS Trading ATS compete against 12 other equities exchanges as of December 31, 2024, and over 25 other ATSs and single dealer platforms. Market participants have multiple venues for the execution of orders, including national securities exchanges and numerous off-exchange venues, including other ATSs and broker-dealers that internalize orders off-exchange. Additionally, corporate and ETP issuers have multiple venues they can choose from in the listing of their products. In Canada, our recognized Canadian securities exchange, Cboe Canada Inc., competes with several Canadian exchanges and ATSs. In Australia, our exchange, Cboe Australia, competes with other Australian exchanges and crossing systems. In Japan, our equities exchanges and PTSs, compete with several Japanese exchanges and other PTSs.\nThe market for execution and clearing services in Europe became more competitive following the introduction of MiFID II and the Regulation on Markets in Financial Instruments (Regulation (EU) No 600/2014) (“MiFIR”). Our major competitors in Europe include national stock exchanges, other pan-European MTFs, systematic internalizers, and other European clearinghouses.\nThe global FX market remains severely fragmented, with transparent automated marketplaces such as Cboe FX challenging a small number of similarly situated competitors. While the global FX market has experienced a shift from competing interbank platforms to ECNs, the electronification of the spot and NDF FX market may encounter resistance from customers that still prefer to utilize the phone, instant chats, terminals and key banking relationships for price discovery and trading. Furthermore, levels of electronification of the FX market have remained relatively static. The electronic spot FX market is also intensely competitive, with over 10 other venues competing for market share as of December 31, 2024. Cboe measures and reports on market share against a narrower set of competitors, included in those venues. \nIn addition, Cboe Data Vantage faces competition from other securities exchanges, technology companies, third-party market data providers, and information and software vendors, which have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchanges or trading venues. The sale of our proprietary data products is also under competitive threat from ATSs and trading venues that offer similar products. Distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products.\n15\nTable \no\nf Contents\nTechnology\nCboe's Trading Technology\nThe trading platform for our equities, options, and futures markets is built upon our Cboe Titanium technology platform. It is developed, owned, and operated in-house and is designed to optimize reliability, speed, scalability, and versatility. Using common protocols and features, Cboe’s unified Cboe Titanium technology platform is designed to offer customers an efficient, consistent experience regardless of where they are in the world. Our exchanges provide different market models, appealing to different user bases, and the trading technologies support all of them. Further, the technologies are designed to support many specialized features for each of the markets, such as: dark pools, trade reporting facility, systematic internalizer, Large-in-Scale, smart order routing, FLEX options, 24x5 trading, and hybrid trading (combining electronic and open outcry). In addition, Cboe and its applicable subsidiaries operate separate trading and/or clearing platforms, as applicable, for BIDS Trading, certain Cboe Canada Inc. order books, Cboe Digital Exchange, Cboe Clear U.S., Cboe Clear Europe, and Cboe FX.\nOur trading platforms have generally experienced very low operational downtime and low latency. We have undertaken significant efforts to upgrade our Cboe Titanium technology platform to help meet increased performance and capacity requirements and help ensure competitiveness, support growth and advance a consistent world class platform globally. The trading platforms use readily available hardware, thereby minimizing capital outlays required for each new market entry. Also, in order to continue to implement new enhancements to our trading platforms, new releases of software are generally deployed routinely in all of the applicable markets.\nDisaster Recovery\nWe operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities for all of our markets. We expect that, in certain instances, the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period of time and in certain instances we may also work with our market participants to try to quickly reopen marketplaces. We regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests using our back-up data centers, as well as an annual test with our U.S. trading participants. Cboe Canada Inc., as required by local regulations, conducts internal testing of its disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually, and participates in the bi-annual testing coordinated by CIRO. Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan conduct internal testing of their disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually. In Europe, we also regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests which use our back-up data center, as well as an annual test with our European trading participants. We continue to work to improve both the availability of our technology and our disaster recovery facilities.\nEmerging Technologies\nWe are exploring the potential use of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning, blockchain, distributed ledger technology, quantum computing, the cloud, and other emerging technologies to potentially help drive new products, increase productivity, improve our self-regulatory oversight responsibilities, and increase automation of tasks.\nRouting and Clearing\nOCC is the sole provider of clearing on all of our U.S. options exchanges and CFE. National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTC”), is the sole provider of clearing on our U.S. listed equity exchanges. The Canadian Depository for Securities (“CDS”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on Cboe Canada Inc. With respect to Australian equities and derivatives, Cboe Australia delivers matched trades of its customers to ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Settlement Pty Ltd. ASX Clear Pty Ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Australia. The Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (“JSCC”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on Cboe Japan’s Cboe-Alpha, Cboe-Select, Cboe-Match and Cboe BIDS Japan. BofA Securities, Inc. (“BOA”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on BIDS Trading. Cboe Europe Equities relies on LCH Limited and LCH SA (“LCH”), Cboe Clear Europe, and SIX x-clear Ltd (“SIX x-clear”) to clear trades in European listed equity securities and exchange traded products as part of an interoperable clearing model. For derivatives, Cboe NL relies on Cboe Clear Europe to clear both index and single stock derivative contracts. With respect to U.S. government securities transactions executed on Cboe Fixed Income, we use Mirae Asset Securities (USA) Inc. to deliver matched trades to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) Government Securities Division (GSD), which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Fixed Income and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of those matched trades. For SFT in cash equities and ETFs, Cboe Clear Europe provides central clearing, settlement and post-trade lifecycle management. Cboe Clear U.S. is the sole provider of clearing and settlement of all digital asset transactions occurring on Cboe Digital Exchange in cash-settled margin futures on Bitcoin and Ether.\nCboe Trading is a routing broker-dealer used by our four U.S. equities exchanges and our four U.S. options exchanges, including the electronic platform portion of Cboe Options. Cboe Trading’s clearing firms are Wedbush Securities, Inc. (“Wedbush”) and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”).\n16\nTable \no\nf Contents\nDigital Assets and Recent Developments\nCboe Digital is an operator of a CFTC-regulated futures exchange (Cboe Digital Exchange) and a CFTC-regulated clearinghouse (Cboe Clear U.S.). Prior to May 31, 2024, Cboe Digital Exchange and Cboe Clear U.S. also operated a U.S.-based spot digital asset trading market (“Cboe Digital spot market”), but as of May 31, 2024, the Cboe Digital spot market is closed for all participant and trading purposes. Cboe Digital does not engage in proprietary trading activities and does not maintain a trading entity. Cboe Digital does not maintain any digital assets, does not itself trade digital assets, does not trade on its own exchange, and does not maintain an affiliate trading entity for purposes of trading, market making, or liquidity provision on its exchange. Cboe Clear U.S. maintains its own operating funds in separate bank accounts from its customer funds.\nRegulatory Environment and Compliance\nVarious aspects of our business are subject to regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, various state regulators, CIRO, the Canadian Securities Administrators (and, in particular, the Ontario Securities Commission or “OSC”), the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (“ASIC”), JFSA, JSDA, ESMA, FCA, the Central Bank of the Netherlands (“DNB”), AFM, Bank of England, and other international regulatory authorities where our exchanges or Cboe Clear Europe may be authorized to act as foreign exchanges or provide clearing services, and market participants may be subject to regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, National Futures Association (“NFA”), FCA, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, U.S. Department of the Treasury and/or foreign regulators.\nRecent Developments\nLaws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed to address perceived problems, new products, or competition or at the request of market participants. In particular, both the SEC and CFTC will be under new leadership as part of the transition to President Trump's administration which adds additional uncertainty to the regulatory environment. The following is a brief discussion of recent regulatory developments that may significantly impact our business.\nUnited States\nEquity Market Structure \nIn December 2022, the SEC released four proposals that could impact equity market structure: (1) Disclosure of Order Execution Information (\"Rule 605\"); (2) Regulation NMS Amendments: Tick Size, Access Fees, and Transparency (“Tick Size/Access Fee Cap”); (3) Regulation Best Execution; and (4) Proposed Rule to Enhance Order Competition. Each of these proposals have been noticed for public comment, and in 2024, Rule 605 and the Tick Size/Access Fee Cap proposals were approved by the SEC and await implementation. Rule 605 may result in increased technology and compliance costs to Cboe. The Tick Size/Access Fee Cap rule is also likely to result in increased technology and compliance costs to Cboe, as well as potential adverse impact to Cboe’s trading volume and transaction fee revenue. The SEC has yet to take any additional action on Regulation Best Execution and Order Competition, but if adopted as-is, these proposals could result in market technology changes and additional compliance costs to Cboe. Further, it is possible that additional proposals or changes to the existing equity market structure could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, bills are sometimes introduced in the U.S. Congress that also could potentially impact equity market structure and adversely impact our volumes and operations. See “Risk Factors” for more information. \nVolume Based Pricing Proposal\nOn October 18, 2023, the SEC released a proposed rule that would impact the way in which volume based discounts are applied (“Volume Based Proposal”). If adopted as-is, this Volume Based Proposal would prohibit national securities exchanges, including Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, from offering volume-based transaction pricing in connection with the execution of agency or riskless principal orders in NMS stocks, and likely inhibit Cboe’s ability to attract liquidity and offer competitive pricing to differentiate Cboe from our competitor exchanges. Although the proposed new rules do not appear likely to have a potential near term material impact, the new rules, if adopted as-is, may have a long term material impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results if, for example, there is a reduction of overall volumes, liquidity, or market share on Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA. See “Risk Factors” for more information. \nEurope\nOTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories\nRegulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (the “European Market Infrastructure Regulation” or “EMIR”) sets out rules relating to over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets, central counterparties and trade repositories. EMIR was enhanced \n17\nTable \no\nf Contents\nand amended by EMIR REFIT and EMIR 2.2. The final text on EMIR 3.0 entered into force on December 24, 2024. Further supporting regulatory technical standards are expected to be published over the course of 2025.\nEU Transparency Rules \nOn November 11, 2021, the European Council (“E.C.”) published its proposal for a review of EU market structure legislation, including proposed amendments to MiFIR and Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (“MiFID II”). The legislative phase of the review is now complete and revised MiFIR rules came into effect on March 28, 2024. The deadline for transposing MiFID II amendments is September 29, 2025. The final text includes, among other provisions, provision for a consolidated tape for the EU, a ban on payment for order flow, replacement of the double volume cap with a single volume cap for trades executed under certain trade waivers and changes to the transparency regime for equities. These provisions are expected to be implemented in the second half of 2025 through a number of level 2 measures. The legislation, as drafted, does not appear likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. However, there are review clauses contained in the legislation which provide a further opportunity to review the effectiveness of the transparency regime, at which point, potential changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. See “Risk Factors” for more information.\nCompliance\nU.S. Securities Industry\nFederal securities laws have established a two-tiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants. The first tier consists of the SEC, which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws. The second tier consists of self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), which are non-governmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the SEC. The Exchanges are SROs, each registered under Section 6 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) as a “national securities exchange,” and are subject to oversight by the SEC.\nSROs are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors. To be registered as a national securities exchange, an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the SEC prior to beginning operations. Among other things, the SEC must determine that the SRO has the ability to comply with the Exchange Act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange.\nIn general, an exchange SRO is responsible for operating its trading platforms consistent with its rules, and regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members. The rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and, among other things, provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer. Additionally, the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.\nAs registered national securities exchanges, virtually all facets of our Exchange operations are subject to the SEC’s oversight, as prescribed by the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities, including record keeping and the day-to-day responsibilities for market operations and broker-dealer oversight. Furthermore, as SROs, the Exchanges are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the SEC or other interested parties. The SEC also has broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses, suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange, or remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations. For example, in the past we have entered into consent orders with the SEC, under which our subsidiaries were censured, ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the Exchange Act, paid fines, and completed certain undertakings. \nAs part of its regulatory oversight, the SEC conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges, and the Exchanges have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections. To the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes, we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business, which may adversely affect our business. We collect certain fees to cover Section 31 fees charged to the Exchanges by the SEC and certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings. The Exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment of Section 31 fees to the SEC. Additionally, under the rules of each of our exchanges, as required by the SEC, any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for non-regulatory purposes.\nSection 19 of the Exchange Act also provides that we must submit to the SEC proposed changes to any of the Exchanges’ rules, including revisions of their certificates of incorporation, bylaws, or other governing documents of the SROs or their parent companies. The SEC will typically publish the proposal for public comment, following which the SEC may approve or disapprove the proposal, as it deems appropriate. Certain categories of rule changes, like fee changes, can be effective on filing, but the SEC retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time.\n18\nTable \no\nf Contents\nCanadian Securities Industry\nCboe Canada Inc. is subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by its primary provincial securities regulatory authority, the OSC. In addition, Cboe Canada Inc. is a Marketplace Member of, and subject to a regulation services agreement with, CIRO. The regulations applicable to Cboe Canada Inc. cover a wide array of areas, including, but not limited to, marketplace operations (which include corporate governance, fair access, systems compliance and integrity, and conflict management requirements), trading rules, electronic trading risk management, and financial viability.\nAustralian Securities Industry\nCboe Australia is subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by ASIC. The regulations applicable to Cboe Australia cover a wide array of areas, including, but not limited to, marketplace operations (which include corporate governance, fair access, systems compliance and integrity, and conflict management requirements), trading rules, electronic trading risk management, and financial viability.\nJapanese Securities Industry\nCboe Japan is subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by the JFSA and the JSDA. The regulations applicable to Cboe Japan cover a wide array of areas, including, but not limited to, marketplace operations (which include corporate governance, fair access, systems compliance and integrity, and conflict management requirements), trading rules, electronic trading risk management, and financial viability.\nFutures and Swaps Industry-CFE and Cboe SEF\nThe operations of each of CFE and Cboe SEF are subject to regulation by the CFTC under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). The CEA generally requires that futures trading in the United States be conducted on a designated contract market and, in some cases, requires swaps trading to be conducted on a swap execution facility (“SEF”) or designated contract market (“DCM”). The CEA and CFTC regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded, and for a trading platform to be designated as a swap execution facility on which certain swaps may be traded. Designation as a contract market or swap execution facility for the trading of specified futures or swaps contracts is non-exclusive. This means that the CFTC may permit additional exchanges or trading platforms to be contract markets or swap execution facilities for trading the same or similar contracts. \nCFE is a designated contract market, and Cboe SEF is a swap execution facility, each of which is subject to the oversight of the CFTC and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the CEA. As a designated contract market, CFE is required to comply with the applicable core principles and regulations under the CEA, as is Cboe SEF as a swap execution facility. Each of CFE and Cboe SEF has surveillance and regulatory operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with CFE rules, and by participants with Cboe SEF rules, as applicable. If CFE or Cboe SEF fails to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, it may be subject to: censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of its business, and removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of CFE’s designation as a contract market or Cboe SEF’s designation as a swap execution facility.\nDigital Assets\nCboe Digital Exchange is a CFTC-registered designated contract market, and Cboe Clear U.S. is a CFTC-registered derivatives clearing organization, each of which is subject to the oversight of the CFTC and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the CEA. As a designated contract market, Cboe Digital Exchange is required to comply with the applicable core principles and regulations under the CEA, as is Cboe Clear U.S. as a derivatives clearing organization. Each of Cboe Digital Exchange and Cboe Clear U.S. has surveillance and regulatory operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with Cboe Digital Exchange rules, and by clearing members with Cboe Clear U.S. rules. If Cboe Digital Exchange or Cboe Clear U.S. fails to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, it may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of its business, removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of Cboe Digital Exchange’s designation as a contract market or Cboe Clear U.S.’s designation as a derivatives clearing organization.\nCboe Clear U.S. has surrendered or is in the process of surrendering its money transmitter licenses in the states where such licenses or equivalent were required to conduct business in connection with the Cboe Digital spot market, which closed on May 31, 2024. In addition, Cboe Clear U.S. has surrendered its BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”).\nEurope\nCboe Europe is located in London and is subject to regulation in the UK and to certain European regulations. The current UK regulatory system was established by the Financial Services Act 2012 (“FSA12”), which amended the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The legislation replaced the previous financial services regulator, the Financial Services \n19\nTable \no\nf Contents\nAuthority, with three new bodies: The Financial Policy Committee (“FPC”), The Prudential Regulation Authority, and the FCA. Financial conduct of markets, including activity on, and the operation of, markets is regulated by the FCA, which is an independent non-governmental body, given statutory powers by the FSA12. The FCA has three statutory objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the markets for financial services. The FCA is accountable to His Majesty’s Treasury Ministers and, through them, to Parliament. \nCboe Clear Europe and Cboe NL are located in Amsterdam and subject to Dutch law and regulation. The current Dutch regulatory system was established by the Act on Financial Supervision. Financial conduct of markets, including activity on, and the operation of, markets is regulated by the AFM. Financial conduct of CCPs, including clearing activity is regulated by the AFM and DNB. The AFM is an independent non-governmental body, given statutory powers by the Act on Financial Supervision. The AFM has three strategic objectives: to promote the fair and conscientious provision of financial services, to promote the fair and efficient operation of the capital markets, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system. The AFM is accountable to the Minister of Finance. The DNB is the Dutch central bank, financial sector supervisor and resolution authority. The DNB is committed to a stable financial system: stable prices, solid financial institutions, and properly functioning payment transfers. Cboe Clear Europe is recognized as a non-UK CCP in the United Kingdom, which allows it to provide services to UK Clearing Participants and UK trading venues. Cboe Clear Europe is also recognized as a foreign central counterparty in Switzerland, which allows it to provide services to Swiss Clearing Participants and SIX Swiss Exchange AG. Cboe NL is also subject to regulation by ESMA.\nMuch of the UK and Dutch financial services regulation originates from the EU. Such regulation includes organizational requirements, capital resources requirements and the specific requirements for RMs and MTFs and are applicable to both Cboe Europe and Cboe NL. MiFID II and MiFIR set out requirements for RMs and MTFs with respect to the establishment of transparent and non-discretionary rules and procedures governing access and for fair and orderly trading and the efficient execution of orders, as well as to facilitate the efficient settlement of transactions conducted on RMs and MTFs and monitoring compliance with the rules. EMIR governs the CCPs operating in the EU and requires them to meet common risk management, governance and capital adequacy standards. The regulatory functions required of Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives, including Cboe Clear Europe and Cboe NL, by MiFID II, MiFIR, EMIR, and other relevant legislation and regulations are performed by in-house staff. Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives utilize the same state-of-the-art, real-time surveillance system that is used in the U.S. to monitor trading and market activities on BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX. Cboe Clear Europe utilizes proprietary risk management software to monitor settlement and funding flows.\nGlobal FX\nWhile the global institutional spot FX market remains largely unregulated, the enactment of the Dodd Frank Act and its related regulations in the United States and the ongoing implementation of MiFID II and MiFIR in Europe have impacted the regulatory landscape for currency derivative products. For example, certain standardized currency derivative products are required to trade on an organized trading venue such as a SEF or DCM in the United States or on an MTF or organized trading facility in Europe. Moreover, even in the largely unregulated spot FX market, this movement towards additional trading standards and norms is highlighted by the publication of the FX Global Code in 2017 by the Global Foreign Exchange Committee, and re-affirmed in 2021, reflecting principles of good conduct for the wholesale FX market, and whose publication may lead to additional oversight in the global FX market. Cboe FX issued a Statement of Commitment declaring its commitment to conduct its FX market activities in a manner consistent with the principles of the FX Global Code. Following the publication of the FX Global Code regulators continue to take a closer look at the spot FX market, and any decision to impose new regulations may affect our spot FX business line.\nBroker\n-\nDealers\nCboe Trading, BIDS Trading, and Cboe Fixed Income are registered broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, FINRA, other SROs of which they are members and various state securities regulators. Cboe Trading currently operates as a routing broker-dealer for sending orders from the Exchanges to other venues for execution, including routing orders among the Exchanges. Cboe Trading is considered a facility of each of the Exchanges and is subject to the rules of the Exchanges. The Exchanges are responsible for enforcing Cboe Trading’s compliance with their rules, including to ensure Cboe Trading is not given preferential treatment. BIDS Trading currently operates an ATS, which is designed to bring counterparties together to anonymously trade large blocks of U.S. equities. BIDS Trading is not a member of any of the U.S. national securities exchanges and is not subject to exchange rules. Cboe Fixed Income, a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, operates an electronic trading system for U.S. government securities targeted at the institutional inter-dealer market for trading on-the-run U.S. Treasury bonds and notes in the secondary OTC markets. Cboe Fixed Income’s participants are SEC registered broker-dealers that are members of The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation’s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation.\nCboe Trading, BIDS Trading, and Cboe Fixed Income are subject to SEC and SRO rules, as applicable, and, as registered broker-dealers, regulations concerning all aspects of their businesses, including: trading practices, order handling, best execution, anti-money laundering, handling of material non-public information, safeguarding data, reporting, capital adequacy, record retention, market access and the conduct of their officers, employees, and other associated persons. The SEC, SROs and state securities commissions may conduct proceedings which can result in injunctions or other sanctions, \n20\nTable \no\nf Contents\ncensures, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers, or employees. The SEC and FINRA impose certain minimum capital requirement rules that require notification when a broker-dealer’s net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer, constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances and impose certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital.\nIn addition, the ATS operated by BIDS Trading is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof, as such, Cboe intends to maintain the BIDS ATS as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the Exchanges. The Chief Executive Officer of BIDS Trading is expected to lead BIDS Trading as an independent business within Cboe, reporting into an independent committee of the board of Cboe Global Markets. Further, Cboe Trading will not route orders to BIDS Trading on behalf of the Exchanges.\nCboe Global Markets\nCertain aspects of Cboe Global Markets are also subject to SEC, FCA, and AFM oversight, including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders. The focus of the SEC’s regulation of Cboe Global Markets is to assure fair representation of members in the selection of the directors of the Exchanges, public participation in the governance of the Exchanges, and that the Exchanges can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the Exchange Act. Furthermore, the SEC requires that Cboe Global Markets give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the self-regulatory function of the Exchanges and to Cboe Global Markets’ obligations to investors and the general public. The SEC also requires that Cboe Global Markets not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the Board of Directors of any of the Exchanges relating to its regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of such Exchange to carry out its responsibilities under the Exchange Act. To the extent that Cboe Global Markets’ business activities involve or relate to the Exchanges, the officers and directors of Cboe Global Markets may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws. Accordingly, the SEC may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain Cboe Global Markets’ activities and those activities may be subject to SEC approval and, in some cases, public notice and comment. \nIn addition, Cboe Global Markets indirectly holds all of the issued share capital and voting rights in Cboe Europe and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cboe Chi-X Europe and Cboe NL. As a result, we and any person who holds, or has voting power with respect to, 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Cboe Global Markets common stock may be subject to certain regulatory requirements under UK and Dutch law. \nU.S. Regulatory Responsibilities\nOur U.S.-based exchanges are responsible for assessing the compliance of their TPHs or members, including Cboe Trading, with the respective exchange’s rules and the applicable rules of the SEC and/or CFTC. The main activities that the exchanges, as applicable, are required to monitor for the purpose of compliance with these rules include: \n•\nsurveillance designed to detect violations of exchange trading rules; \n•\nsurveillance designed to detect violations of SEC and/or CFTC rules; \n•\ninvestigation of matters involving potential rule violations; \n•\nthe investigation of complaints about possible rule violations brought by customers, TPHs, members, or other SROs; and \n•\nthe examination of TPHs or members for compliance with rules such as those related to net capital, books and records, market access, and other matters related to the TPHs’ or members’ exchange business functions. \nIn order to ensure market integrity, we regulate and monitor our TPHs’ and members’ trading activities by using both our employees and/or third parties under regulatory services agreements. See “U.S. Regulatory Agreements” below. Providing effective regulation is important for attracting and retaining the confidence and participation of market-makers, broker-dealers and institutional and retail investors.\nWe expend considerable time, financial resources, and effort to ensure that the exchanges’ rules and regulations conform to regulatory best practices within the securities and futures exchange industries and within the regulatory regime overseen by the SEC and CFTC, our primary U.S. regulators. In order to support our efforts and those of our market participants to comply with applicable law and our exchange rules, we developed a regulatory program to monitor market activity on our exchanges.\nAll of our Exchanges, CFE, and Cboe Digital Exchange are participants in various cooperative and regulatory information sharing agreements, including in the Intermarket Surveillance Group (“ISG”). ISG is an international information-sharing cooperative governed by a written agreement that provides for a comprehensive surveillance sharing arrangement. In addition to the agreement for confidential information sharing, the ISG provides a framework for the coordination of \n21\nTable \no\nf Contents\nregulatory efforts among exchanges trading securities, commodity futures, and related products to address potential intermarket manipulations and trading abuses. \nCFE, Cboe SEF, and Cboe Digital Exchange are also members of the Joint Audit Committee (“JAC”), which is a representative committee of the U.S. futures exchanges and regulatory organizations which participate in a joint audit and financial surveillance program that has been approved and is overseen by the CFTC. The JAC’s primary responsibility is to oversee the implementation and functioning of all terms and conditions of the Joint Audit Agreement and to determine the practices and procedures to be followed by each designated self-regulatory organization in the conduct of regulatory examinations and financial reviews of FCMs.\nAs part of the regulatory program, each of our Exchanges and CFE have rules pertaining to their respective disciplinary processes.\nU.S. Regulatory Agreements\nThe Exchanges and CFE have entered into agreements under which third parties have agreed to perform regulatory functions on behalf of our markets (e.g., regulatory services agreements). As discussed below, in addition, in certain other instances for our Exchanges, a third party has been allocated the regulatory responsibility under Rule 17d-1 or Rule 17d-2 under the Exchange Act, while in others, we retain the regulatory responsibility for the activities. \nRegulatory Services Agreement with FINRA\nThe Exchanges have entered into agreements with FINRA under which FINRA has agreed to provide regulatory services to the Exchanges. Under these agreements, FINRA performs certain regulatory functions on behalf of the Exchanges and, to avoid any potential conflicts of interest concerning the regulation and oversight of Cboe Trading, certain regulatory services specific to Cboe Trading. The Exchanges remain responsible for the regulation of their TPHs, members and marketplaces, and retain the authority for bringing disciplinary actions against their TPHs and members, although FINRA performs certain functions on behalf of the Exchanges. The Exchanges also perform certain regulatory and disciplinary-related functions in-house.\nRegulatory Services Agreement with OCC\nWhile CFE also performs most regulatory and disciplinary-related functions in-house, the OCC has performed and continues to perform certain regulatory functions on behalf of CFE pursuant to an RSA with CFE. Whether performed under an RSA or in-house, CFE retains overall responsibility for the regulation of its marketplace and for bringing disciplinary actions.\nRule 17d-1 Designations and Rule 17d-2 Agreements\nSection 17(d) of the Exchange Act and the related Exchange Act rules permit SROs to allocate certain regulatory responsibilities to avoid duplicative oversight and regulation. Under Exchange Act Rule 17d-1, the SEC designates one SRO to be the designated examining authority (“DEA”) for each broker-dealer that is a member of more than one SRO. The DEA is responsible for the regulatory oversight of applicable financial responsibility rules pertaining to that broker-dealer. Cboe Options is the DEA for several of its TPHs. Cboe Trading’s assigned DEA is FINRA. \nExchange Act Rule 17d-2 permits SROs to enter into agreements, commonly called Rule 17d-2 agreements, which are approved by the SEC and concern the allocation of regulatory responsibility for rules applicable to TPHs and members that those SROs have in common. The Exchanges have entered into certain bi-lateral Rule 17d-2 agreements under which FINRA is allocated responsibility for enforcing certain federal securities laws and certain exchange rules that are common with FINRA rules. The Exchanges have entered into certain other multi-party Rule 17d-2 agreements that allocate responsibility among the participating SROs, which may include the Exchanges, for oversight of their allocated common members compliance with certain rules governing, among other items, options related sales practices, options related market surveillance, insider trading, NMS and Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”) NMS plan compliance. \nNational Market System Plans\nWe are member participants of several NMS plans including, but not limited to, the following: Cboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are member exchanges in OPRA, which is the designated securities information processor for market information that is generated through the trading of exchange-listed securities options in the United States, and it disseminates certain core trading information, such as last sale reports and quotations. BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX also participate in the CTA/CQ and the UTP Plans, which perform analogous services for the U.S. equities market. In November of 2024, the SEC approved a new Consolidated Tape Plan that, when fully operational, will replace the existing CTA/CQ and UTP Plans. The Securities Information Automation Corporation acts as the “processor” for OPRA and the CTA/CQ Plans. Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC acts as the processor for the Nasdaq Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan. See “Risk Factors” for more information regarding the consolidated data plan order.\n22\nTable \no\nf Contents\nCboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are also parties to the Options Order Protection and Locked/Crossed Market Plan, which is designed to prohibit trade-throughs and avoid locked/crossed markets. Cboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are also parties to the Options Listing Procedures Plan, which sets forth the procedures that the options exchanges must follow to list new options. Cboe Options, BZX, EDGA, and EDGX are also parties to the NMS plan for the selection and reservation of securities symbols. \nUnder the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority Plan (“ORSA Plan”), U.S. securities options exchanges are permitted to act jointly in the administration, operation and maintenance of a regulatory system for the surveillance, investigation and detection of the unlawful use of undisclosed, material information in trading in one or more of their markets. The ORSA Plan is intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency with which the exchanges regulate their respective markets and to avoid duplication of certain regulatory efforts. FINRA operates the ORSA Plan facility for options insider trading.\nThe Consolidated Audit Trail Plan (“CAT Plan”) functions as the limited liability company agreement of Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC (“CATLLC”), the limited liability company formed under Delaware state law through which the SROs (the “Plan Participants”) conduct the activities of the Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”). The CAT Plan also serves as the national market system plan pertaining to the creation, implementation, and maintenance of a CAT that tracks orders throughout their lifecycle, which strives to enhance regulators’ ability to efficiently monitor trading activity in Eligible Securities in the U.S. securities markets. Eligible Securities currently include NMS Stocks, Listed Options and OTC Equities. Order and trade data is required to be reported to the CAT central repository the following day by each SRO/Plan Participant and broker-dealer (an “Industry Member”), along with certain customer and account information by each Industry Member. On November 15, 2016, the SEC approved the CAT Plan and a phased implementation was originally required to begin in November 2017; however, there were some delays. The first phase of CAT (“Phase 1”) ultimately went live in November 2018, at which time we and other SROs/Plan Participants began initial reporting of order and trade file submissions to the CAT. The second phase of CAT (“Phase 2”) for Industry Members began with order and trade file submissions in June 2020. The final Phase 2 implementation sub-phase (\"Phase 2e\"), related to Industry Member submissions to the customer and account information submissions system (“CAIS”), was completed on May 31, 2024.\nOn May 15, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to the CAT Plan to establish financial accountability provisions to achieve full CAT implementation, including a financial accountability milestone requiring full implementation of the CAT requirements by December 30, 2022. If the SEC were to determine any financial accountability milestone was not met, it may limit the SROs’/Plan Participants’ recovery of certain loans previously advanced to CATLLC to fund CAT costs. Due to the delayed completion of CAIS, the SROs/Plan Participants have submitted to the SEC requests to extend the timeline for the completion of Phase 2e and the deadline for the final financial accountability milestone and additional requests may be submitted. If the SEC does not grant extensions and finds that the SROs/Plan Participants did not satisfy the related last financial accountability milestone, it could result in the SROs/Plan Participants not being able to recover certain amounts loaned to CATLLC to fund CAT costs associated with this final sub-phase, which the amount of unrecoverable costs may increase for additional delays.\nOn September 6, 2023, the SEC issued an order approving an amendment to the CAT Plan to implement a revised funding model (“CAT Funding Model”) for CATLLC to fund the CAT. The approved CAT Funding Model contemplates two categories of CAT fees calculated based on the “executed equivalent shares” of transactions in eligible securities: (i) CAT fees assessed by CATLLC to Industry Members who are CAT Executing Brokers (the brokers responsible for executing each side of the transaction) to recover a portion of historical CAT costs previously funded by monies loaned to CATLLC by the Plan Participants; and (ii) CAT fees assessed by CATLLC to CAT Executing Brokers and Plan Participants to fund prospective CAT costs. \nPrior to the effectiveness of the CAT Funding Model, the funding of the CAT was solely provided by the SROs/Plan Participants in exchange for promissory notes. Pursuant to the CAT Funding Model, the Plan Participants submitted fee filings during the third week of August 2024 to assess fees as of October 1, 2024 by CATLLC to CAT Executing Brokers for Buyers and Sellers that will be collected by CATLLC and remitted to the Plan Participants as repayment of or a portion of the promissory notes issued by the Plan Participants to fund the CAT prior to January 1, 2022 (the \"CAT Historical Assessment #1 Fee\"). Additional CAT fees that will be collected by CATLLC to recover a portion of other historical CAT costs incurred between January 1, 2022 and July 15, 2024 are planned to be introduced at a later time through separate fee filings submitted by the Plan Participants. CATLLC started remitting funds collected through the CAT Historical Assessment #1 to Plan Participants in December 2024 (for transactions occurring in October 2024) and will continue to do so until the balance due to be collected is paid in full, which is estimated to occur over approximately 24 months from the fee's implementation. \nAdditionally, pursuant to the CAT Funding Model, the Plan Participants submitted fee filings during the second week of August 2024 to implement the applicable initial transaction-based fee rates that are to be assessed by CATLLC to CAT Executing Brokers to cover a portion of prospective CAT costs, effective as of September 3, 2024. Pursuant to fee filings submitted by Plan Participants on behalf of CATLLC, as of September 3, 2024, CATLLC began assessing transaction-based fees to CAT Executing Brokers for Buyers and Sellers to cover a portion of prospective CAT costs. At the same time, CATLLC also began assessing a transaction-based fee to the respective Plan Participants for the same amount. To continue to fund CATLLC as it transitioned to collecting fees from Industry Members and Plan Participants to cover ongoing CAT costs in accordance with the CAT Funding Model, Plan Participants temporarily issued short-term notes to CATLLC to cover CAT costs that were payable to CATLLC until CATLLC collected sufficient proceeds from the fees to cover those costs. As of \n23\nTable \no\nf Contents\nJanuary 2025, CATLLC has fully repaid these short-term notes through funds collected from the fees assessed to CAT Executing Brokers and Plan Participants. CATLLC has also used the funds collected to pay CATLLC expenses and has retained excess funds as a reserve as per the CAT Funding Model and budget. Moving forward, CATLLC plans for the Plan Participants to submit prospective fee filings on CATLLC’s behalf every six months to update the transaction fee rates as necessary to cover prospective CAT costs. The last such filings were submitted in December 2024 and effected a rate change beginning January 2, 2025. The Company expects Plan Participants will no longer issue additional short-term notes to CATLLC to fund CAT given that CATLLC has begun imposing and collecting fees to cover CAT costs.\nOn October 17, 2023, the American Securities Association (“ASA”) and Citadel Securities, LLC (“Citadel”) filed a Petition for Review of the CAT Funding Model Order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (“11th Circuit”). On November 16, 2023, the Cboe U.S. national securities exchanges, the NYSE U.S. national securities exchanges, the Nasdaq U.S. national securities exchanges and CATLLC (\"Intervenors\") filed motions to intervene on behalf of the SEC. On January 17, 2024, the 11th Circuit granted each of the motions to intervene on behalf of the SEC and established a briefing schedule and merits briefing concluded in the second quarter of 2024. \nOn September 13, 2024, Citadel filed a motion to stay the CAT Funding Model Order and to enjoin the collection of certain CAT fees during the pendency of this litigation, which the 11th Circuit denied on November 27, 2024. Oral argument on the merits was held on February 3, 2025. This challenge or any other challenge to the CAT Funding Model Order and/or Plan Participant(s) fee filings on behalf of CATLLC may significantly delay efforts by CATLLC to continue collecting the CAT fees. As a result, the Plan Participants may continue to incur additional significant costs, and/or it may result in them not being able to collect on the promissory notes related to the funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT. The Company believes the challenge is without merit and intends to vigorously litigate the matter.\nPortions of promissory notes related to the funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT may not be collectible, including if the SEC finds that the SROs/Plan Participants did not satisfy any of the financial accountability milestones. The allowance for notes receivable credit losses associated with the CAT is calculated using a methodology that is primarily based on the structure of the notes and various potential outcomes under the CAT Funding Model. See Note 23 (\"Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees\") for more information.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own or have rights to a number of intellectual property assets, including trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents.

Cboe is an equal opportunity employer and provides equal employment opportunities to all qualified persons without regard to sex, gender, race, color, ethnicity, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, veteran or military status, disability, marital status, domestic partnership or civil union status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, genetic status, gender identity or expression, and any other characteristic protected by applicable law (a “Protected Characteristic”). Cboe is committed to applying our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy to all employment practices that impact the terms and conditions of employment including, but not limited to, hiring, evaluation, discipline, promotion, training, compensation, transfer, and termination. Actively nurturing and maintaining an inclusive culture at Cboe is a core imperative. We believe that our collective and unique perspectives fuel our capabilities, enhance our team spirit and enable us to attract and retain top talent as we define the markets of the future. Our commitment and responsibility in this regard starts at the top, with leadership and support from the full Cboe Board of Directors and executive team.\nTo maintain and strengthen our pledge to inclusion and to keep a level playing field, we regularly review key touchpoints across the employee journey with Cboe, from the talent selection, promotion, compensation, leadership development, and succession planning processes and make adjustments, as necessary, to help ensure opportunity parity across the Company. Our goal is to ensure that fair pay and equal opportunity for all that results in a collaborative, high performing organization bringing new innovations to market and providing superior service to our customers.\nAt Cboe, we also have associate resource groups that are open to all employees, regardless of identity.

Our programs and benefit plans provide a corporate atmosphere of collective well-being and incorporate strategies for physical, emotional, mental and financial wellness. Our programs include enhanced employee assistance programs, wellness programs and challenges (which address both mental and physical well-being), and webinars and classes through our retirement vendor to support the financial health of our employees. \nEmployee Engagement and Pulse Surveys, Town Halls and an Open-Door Policy\nIn 2024, Cboe conducted our seventh annual employee engagement survey and has implemented career, leadership, and culture focused programs in response to the survey findings. Our participation rate exceeds standard benchmarks and a significant majority of our employees would recommend Cboe as a great place to work.\n Our senior management team continues to hold the commitment to an open-door policy and encourages the free flow of information and communication in furtherance of active transparency. With the recent strategic framework review, our ability to tap into the voice of our employees was critically important and we conducted a pulse survey to gauge sentiment. Our CEO also issues weekly letters to help connect with our employees. Human Resources also provided ongoing regular resources and tips to help support the variety of challenges, from hybrid work to childcare and elder care, that our employees faced throughout 2024. \nCboe also continues to create an open and frank atmosphere in which any grievance, complaint, suggestion or question receives a timely response. Cboe offers a whistleblower hotline for complaints, which can be made anonymously. Additionally, employees can raise questions and suggestions to the Cboe Human Resources team either in-person or via a group email address and are either responded to individually or addressed at our Global Town Hall meetings. The objective of these town halls is to provide employees an update on Company news, share updates from major business lines, as well as provide a forum to ask questions and offer feedback. Employees are encouraged to participate in the free flow of information and communication and to offer positive and constructive feedback in furtherance of active transparency. \nTraining and Succession Planning\nWe believe that the development of all Cboe employees helps drive our collective success. Through skill and competency development we signal our investment in our employees while also enabling enhanced productivity. Through our tuition reimbursement program, our employees receive financial support in their pursuit of specialized university courses and degrees. In addition to our ongoing offering of online courses on diverse topics through our corporate university, CboeU, employees can participate in our \"Strive for Growth\" programs focused on virtual classroom instruction combined with work application and CboeLive, which is focused on business topics to foster organizational-wide knowledge sharing and education.\nLeadership is another critical element of our success at Cboe. Leaders can participate in Lead the Way, Cboe’s leadership development hybrid program focused on virtual classroom instruction combined with in-person facilitated workshops and exercises, and individual development plans leveraging insights for a 360-feedback process. This leadership training program has helped to expand on the development of our high potential leaders, further strengthening the leadership bench and accelerating readiness of this key talent pool.\n25\nTable \no\nf Contents\nCboe has held multiple succession planning discussions with the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors to plan for the fulfillment of essential roles, such as the CEO and other senior officers. This process includes investments in advanced development planning for targeted successors to accelerate their readiness through key internal projects and assignments as well as tailored training. One of our CEO’s top areas of focus is to develop talent and spend time on succession planning, particularly in light of the executive transitions we experienced in 2023.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed 1,685 individuals in the following locations:\nLocation\nNumber of Employees\nUnited States\n1,113\nUnited Kingdom\n197\nNetherlands\n137\nAustralia\n86\nCanada\n79\nPhilippines\n29\nJapan\n28\nSingapore\n9\nHong Kong\n6\nSwitzerland\n1\nOf these employees, 605 were involved in technology operations and 195 were involved in direct support of trading operations.

    "item1a": "Item 1A.     Risk Factors.\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time relating to our business. These risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us. Any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the key risks and uncertainties described below that we believe are material to us at this time:\n•\nthe loss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures products; \n•\neconomic, political and market conditions;\n•\ncompliance with legal and regulatory obligations; \n•\nprice competition and consolidation in our industry; \n•\ndecreases in trading or clearing volumes, market data fees or a shift in the mix of products traded on our exchanges; \n•\nlegislative or regulatory changes or changes in tax regimes; \n•\nour ability to protect our systems and communication networks from security vulnerabilities and breaches;\n•\nour ability to attract and retain skilled management and other personnel;\n•\nincreasing competition by foreign and domestic entities; \n•\nour dependence on and exposure to risk from third parties; \n•\nfactors that impact the quality and integrity of our and other applicable indices;\n•\nour ability to manage our global operations, growth, and strategic acquisitions or alliances effectively;\n•\nour ability to operate our business without violating the intellectual property rights of others and the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights; \n•\nour ability to minimize the risks, including our credit, counterparty, investment, and default risks, associated with operating our clearinghouses; \n•\nour ability to accommodate trading and clearing volume and transaction traffic, including significant increases, without failure or degradation of performance of our systems; \n•\nmisconduct by those who use our markets or our products or for whom we clear transactions; \n•\nchallenges to our use of open source software code; \n•\nour ability to meet our compliance obligations, including managing our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities; \n•\nthe loss of key customers or a significant reduction in trading or clearing volumes by key customers;\n•\nour ability to maintain BIDS Trading as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with our registered national securities exchanges;\n•\ndamage to our reputation; \n•\nthe ability of our compliance and risk management methods to effectively monitor and manage our risks; \n•\nrestrictions imposed by our debt obligations and our ability to make payments on or refinance our debt obligations; \n•\nour ability to maintain an investment grade credit rating; \n•\nimpairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets, investments or intangible assets; and\n•\nlitigation risks and other liabilities.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nLoss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the S&P 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index, and other indices granted to us by the owners of such indices, and additionally hold exclusive rights to our proprietary VIX Index methodology that provides the basis for VIX options and futures. In 2024, approximately 67% of our total revenues less cost of revenues were generated by the options and futures segments, the majority of which was generated by products based on exclusively licensed indices (e.g., SPX options) and products based on our proprietary VIX methodology (e.g., VIX options and futures). The bulk of this revenue is attributable to our SPX options and VIX options and futures. As a result, our revenues less cost of revenues are dependent in large part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these indices and our ability to maintain our exclusive proprietary rights in the VIX Index methodology and related products and indices. \nThere is a risk, with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses, that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all. In the first event, we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an index product traded by us on an exclusive basis, which could result in a loss of market share and negatively \n29\nTable \no\nf Contents\nimpact our profitability. In the second event, we could lose the right to list the index product entirely. The loss or limited use or change in the commercial terms of any of our exclusive index licenses, especially for the S&P 500 Index, for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nIn addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses, if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the VIX Index methodology and related products and indices, competitors could create substantially similar volatility indices and products or list products based on Cboe volatility indices, which could have a material adverse effect on us. \nIn 2018, the EU implemented the EU Benchmark Regulation, which regulates users, data providers and calculators of benchmarks (“administrators”) in the EU, and among other things (subsequent to the transitional period applicable to third country benchmark administrators) currently prohibits use of benchmarks provided by administrators outside the EU in connection with EU financial instruments unless the administrator is deemed to be subject to an EU equivalent regulatory regime or the benchmark is endorsed or recognized in the EU. These regulations and other potential emerging regulatory regimes around the world may impact international customers’ interest in or ability to trade index-based products listed on our U.S. exchanges, as well as impact our expansion into foreign trading of our index-based products and our ability to license proprietary indices for use outside of the U.S. \nFurthermore, our competitors may succeed in developing, offering and providing a market for the trading of index-based or volatility products, such as new options products on indices or ETFs, that are economically similar to those that we offer and they may become successful and take away volume from our products. It is also possible that a third party may offer trading in index-based products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses, but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not limited by our exclusive license. In addition, a diminished perceived attractiveness of or change in demand for any of the indices underlying our products and services, especially the S&P 500 Index, for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nThe value of our licenses to exclusively list index options and futures also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options and futures based on their indices. Although we and other index owners have prevailed in legal actions seeking to challenge our rights to exclusively license indices, we may be subject to changes in the law or other actions taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively offer trading in certain index options and futures. \nGeneral economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business.\nThe volume of trading and clearing transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic, political and market conditions in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control, including:\n•\neconomic, political and geopolitical market conditions;\n•\nbroad trends in business and finance;\n•\nconcerns over inflation levels and recessions;\n•\nwavering institutional or retail confidence levels;\n•\ngovernment or central bank actions, such as, but not limited to, tariffs, changes in government fiscal and monetary policy, or foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nother legislative and regulatory changes;\n•\nthe availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital;\n•\nthe perceived attractiveness of the U.S., European, Canadian, Australian or Japanese capital markets;\n•\nthe availability or perceived attractiveness of indices, such as the S&P 500 index, or alternative investment opportunities;\n•\nchanges in the level of trading activity in underlying instruments;\n•\nchanges and volatility in the prices of securities;\n•\nchanges in the volume of foreign currency transactions;\n•\nchanges in supply and demand for currencies;\n•\nmovements in currency exchange rates;\n•\nthe level and volatility of interest rates;\n•\nchanges in the financial strength of market participants;\n•\nconsolidation among market participants and market data subscribers;\n•\nunforeseen market closures, suspensions of open outcry trading or other disruptions in trading and clearing; and\n•\ndisruptions due to terrorism, war, extreme weather events, pandemics or other catastrophes.\nAny of these factors, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading and clearing volumes and demand for market data. \n30\nTable \no\nf Contents\nOur business may be adversely affected by price competition. \nThe securities industry is characterized by intense price competition, especially with respect to transaction fees. We may be required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. We also compete with respect to the pricing of market data and value-added market data, such as historical market data. \nIn our options segment, the pricing model for trade execution has changed in response to competitive market conditions, and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly, including by opening new exchanges, which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants. These changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us, especially on transaction fees and incentives for multi-listed products. As a result of these pricing pressures, our average rate per multi-listed options contract may decrease. It is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets.\nIn addition, one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume. Some order-providing firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them. \nWith respect to our proprietary products, we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial market participants that offer over-the-counter derivatives. We also compete against certain multi-listed options products, such as SPY options, which offer some of the features of our proprietary products, such as SPX options.\nTo attract market share, we may offer “inverted” pricing specials or non-transaction fee trading from time to time, per various fee schedules across our equities exchanges. These forms of promotions, along with other supplemental liquidity programs, may adversely affect our profitability.\nFurther, regulatory and legal developments, including the equity market structure proposals and the Volume Based Proposal, if adopted as-is, could also adversely impact, as applicable, our ability to adjust our equities transaction fee schedules to respond to actions by new or existing competitors, our ability to incentivize on-exchange liquidity provision, as well as our ability to offer members volume-based pricing. Additionally, in the U.S., we are generally required to file with the SEC any changes to the fees that we charge and in recent years the SEC has more heavily scrutinized pricing changes. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of our services and products, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner. Also, our profits could decline if competitive pressures or regulatory changes force us to reduce fees.\nA significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transaction and clearing-based businesses. If the amount of trading volume on our markets or clearing volume decreases, or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products, our revenues from transaction and clearing fees will most likely decrease.\nIn 2024, approximately 73% of our revenues less cost of revenues were generated by our transaction and clearing-based business and is heavily oriented towards U.S. index and equity options. This business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow, both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers. If the amount of trading volume on our Exchanges, Cboe Digital Exchange, CFE, BIDS Trading, Cboe Canada Inc., notional value traded on Cboe FX, Cboe SEF, Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives, Cboe Australia, and Cboe Japan or clearing volumes at Cboe Clear Europe or Cboe Clear U.S. decrease, we are likely to see a decrease in fees. \nOur total trading or clearing volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading or clearing activity for any reason, such as:\n•\nheightened capital or margin requirements;\n•\ntransaction, sales, or other tax; \n•\nregulatory or legislative actions;\n•\nreduced need to trade due to changes in volatility and/or passive investment trends;\n•\nreduced access to capital required to fund trading activities; \n•\nconsolidation among market participants;\n•\nsuspensions of open outcry trading; or\n•\nsignificant market disruptions.\n31\nTable \no\nf Contents\nOver the past few years, a number of legislative actions have been taken, both domestically and internationally, or actions by other third parties that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital or margin requirements and additional compliance burdens. These actions, including MiFID II, MiFIR, a recent OCC margin requirement proposal, and the equity market structure rules and proposals, may incentivize trading away from our markets or cause market participants to reduce trading activity on or routing to our markets.\nIn addition, the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors, including the type of customer and certain volume discounts. If our equities trading volume decreases, including as a result of the Volume Based Proposal's proposed prohibition on volume-based agency tiers in the equities markets, or options trading volume shifts to our lower revenue per contract products, our revenues from transaction fees will most likely decrease. We can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease.\nRevenues from our market data fees and access and capacity fees may be reduced due to declines in our market share, trading volumes or regulatory changes.\nThe occurrence of any event that reduces the amount of market data fees that we receive, whether as a result of fee reductions, fewer members subscribing to the U.S. tape plans or other market data offerings, lack of new products, declines in market share, trading volumes, or notional volumes, or regulatory changes may have a direct negative impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results. For example, if our market share of U.S. listed equities and options or Cboe’s European equities trading volume were to decline, our share of market data fees could also decline. Moreover, market data fees could decline as a result of a reduction in the number of market data users, for example because of consolidation among market data subscribers or due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise. \nRegulatory and legal developments could also impact the fees we receive from market data and access and capacity, or our cost in providing such services. In the U.S., we are generally required to file with the SEC any changes to the fees that we charge for our securities market data products and access and capacity fees. In recent years, certain industry groups have objected to the ability of exchanges to charge for certain market data products. In addition, the SEC and some media have scrutinized market data and market access products and fees. As discussed above, the implementation of MDIR or the equity market structure rules and proposals could cause Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with the new rules, and may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results, including if, for example, there are lower SIP plan revenues or we must reduce the fees or access fee caps we charge. Further, we have asked a court to review the SEC’s disapproval of our 2024 proposed rule change to adopt a rule providing that our order and execution management systems (“OEMSs\") that operate independently from our registered national securities exchanges are not “facilities” of those exchanges. This disapproval required our OEMSs to continue to follow exchange regulations, such as rule filing requirements. Being required to continue to follow exchange regulations could reduce our OEMSs’ competitiveness, could result in a reduction of the value of OEMSs to us, and is likely to increase our compliance and challenge costs. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nIn addition, the SEC approved a Consolidated Data Plan to replace the three equity data plans that govern the dissemination of real-time, consolidated market data for NMS stocks. If implemented as-is, the Consolidated Data Plan will reduce Cboe’s voting share in the Operating Committee for the Securities Information Processors, which in turn, may impact Cboe’s ability to influence votes on market data revenue matters.\nWe believe Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives currently offers market data to customers on a non-discriminatory basis at a reasonable cost. As European regulators determine how market data should be disaggregated and what is a reasonable commercial basis for providing market data, it could affect our ability to offer market data products in the same manner that we do today thereby causing an adverse effect on our European market data revenues. While MiFID II and MiFIR aim to encourage a commercial solution to a consolidated tape in Europe, should this fail to materialize, policy makers might be encouraged to implement a mandatory solution that could impact our ability to develop our own commercial offering. As discussed above, the E.C. published provisions for a consolidated tape for the EU, which is expected to be implemented in 2026. As proposed, these provisions may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results if, for example, we must reduce the fees we charge for market data.\nThe technology upon which we rely, including that of our service providers, may be susceptible to security vulnerabilities or breaches that could harm our business and our role in the global marketplace puts us at heightened risk relative to other public companies.\nThe secure and reliable operation of our technology, including our computer systems and communications networks, and those of our service providers, market participants, investments, and other third parties, is a critical element of our operations or our business, financial condition or operating results. These systems and networks may be subject to various cybersecurity incidents such as improper or inadvertent access to or disclosure of confidential, commercially sensitive, or personally identifiable information, data theft, corruption or destruction, ransomware, supply chain attack, denial of service attack, malware and other security problems, as well as acts of terrorism, attacks by threat actors including criminal groups, political activist groups and nation-state actors, attacks in connection with geopolitical activity such as the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, criminal insider activity, employee error, and service provider, market participant or \n32\nTable \no\nf Contents\nthird-party disruptions or security breaches. Additionally, cyber threats and the techniques used in cyberattacks change, develop and evolve rapidly, including from emerging technologies, such as advanced forms of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and quantum computing. Our hybrid work environment, usage of mobile, AI and cloud-based technologies and amount of newly acquired companies and related integrations may increase our risk for a cybersecurity incident. Moreover, given our position in the global financial services industry and as critical infrastructure, we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of such events. While we have experienced in the past, and we expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity threats and events of varying degrees, including events impacting personally identifiable information, we are not aware of any of these threats or events having a material impact on our business, financial condition or operating results to date, however we cannot assure you that we will not experience future threats or events that may be material.\nWe maintain policies, procedures and controls designed to safeguard against cybersecurity incidents and unauthorized access by protecting the confidentiality, integrity, availability and reliability of our systems, networks and information. These policies, procedures and controls are subject to monitoring, auditing, and evaluation practices, pursuant to our Enterprise Risk Management program, which is supported by a three lines of defense approach, and our other governance practices. Further, we developed and maintain cybersecurity and data privacy training programs for our employees and our third-party consultants who have access to our systems. We also conduct simulations, tabletop exercises, and response readiness tests and engage independent third parties on a routine basis to perform cybersecurity penetration assessments. Collectively, these safeguards and measures or those of our third-party providers, including any cloud technologies, may prove inadequate to prevent the attendant risk posed by cybersecurity incidents, subjecting us to contractual restrictions, liability and damages, loss of business, penalties, unfavorable publicity, increased scrutiny by our regulators, and materially impacting our business, financial condition, and operating results. We may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security, including to protect against threatened breaches, to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach, and to address any reputational harm or litigation or regulatory liability. Despite our cybersecurity measures, security vulnerabilities or breaches may remain undetected for an extended period of time. As a result of our ongoing risk management and related assurance activities, we have identified, addressed, and continue to address potential security vulnerabilities and/or internal control weaknesses. We are not aware of any of these vulnerabilities having a material impact on our business, financial condition or operating results to date. However, we cannot provide assurance that any future vulnerabilities, internal control weaknesses, or events that may be experienced will not be material. Such harms also could cause us to lose market participants, experience lower trading volume, and negatively impact our competitive advantage and business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAdditionally, as threats continue to evolve and increase, as we continue to expand ongoing risk management and related assurance activities, and as the domestic and international regulatory environment related to cyber security and data protection becomes increasingly rigorous, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities. Those additional resources could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and continued efforts of management and other key personnel. As a result, to be successful, we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees. However, we have no assurances that these employees will remain with us. The roles and responsibilities of departing executive officers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees, which may require us to devote time and resources to identifying, hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to pursue business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial condition, and operating results. \nThere is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel, particularly in the technology space, which may make it difficult for us to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers. We have previously faced and may in the future face increased challenges in retaining and attracting qualified employees, including as we implement a return to office plan. Further, potential negative perceptions of our human capital management related programs, including whether due to perceived over- or under-pursuit of such programs, may result in increased challenges in retaining or attracting qualified employees, as well as potential litigation or other adverse impacts. If we fail to retain our current employees, it would be difficult and costly to identify, recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business. In particular, failure to retain and attract qualified technology personnel could result in systems failures. Consequently, our reputation may be harmed, we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and motivate our employees in the same manner as we have historically done.\nAdditionally, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees, including the 2023 leadership transitions and the potential transition of our Chief Executive Officer, could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nIntense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance.\nThe market for trade execution services, clearing and products is intensely competitive in the asset classes and geographies in which we operate. Increased competition may result in a decline in our share of trading activity and a decline \n33\nTable \no\nf Contents\nin our revenues from transaction and clearing fees and market data fees, thereby materially adversely affecting our operating results. We compete with a number of entities and markets on several different fronts, including the cost, quality and speed of our trade execution, functionality and ease of use of our trading and clearing platforms, range of our products and services, our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation. In particular, we have seen increased competition from off-exchange venues, which have increased their share of trading activity. See “Business – Competition” for more information.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. These factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products, to offer lower transaction and clearing fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can. In addition, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop, introduce and/or market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products. \nFurthermore, new or existing competitors may:\n•\nrespond more quickly to competitive pressures;\n•\ndevelop products that compete with our products or are preferred by our customers;\n•\noffer products and services at prices below ours to gain market share and to promote other businesses;\n•\ndevelop and expand their technology and service offerings more efficiently;\n•\nprovide better, more user-friendly and more reliable technology;\n•\ndevelop and incorporate more quickly new technologies, such as AI, machine learning, blockchain, distributed ledger technology, quantum computing, tokenization, the cloud, and other emerging technologies;\n•\ntake greater advantage of acquisitions, alliances and other opportunities;\n•\nmarket, promote, bundle and sell their products and services more effectively;\n•\nleverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners more effectively or exploit brand names to market and sell their services; and\n•\nexploit regulatory disparities between traditional, regulated exchanges and alternative markets, including over-the-counter markets, that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model.\nIf our products, markets, services and technology are not competitive or we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology, customer preferences and regulatory requirements or we encounter any significant delays in product development efforts our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially harmed. \nWe depend on third-party service providers for certain services that are important to our business. An interruption, significant increase in fees or cessation or impairment of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe depend on a number of service providers, including clearing organizations such as OCC, NSCC, DTC, CDS, LCH, Cboe Clear Europe, and Cboe Clear U.S., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, JSCC, ASX Clear Pty Ltd, and SIX x-clear; securities information processors such as the CTA, UTP Securities Information Processor and OPRA; regulatory and other service providers such as FINRA and OCC; the hosts of our data and disaster recovery centers; and various vendors of communications and networking products and services. In addition, we also depend on third party routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing transactions on our behalf. More specifically: \n•\nIf OCC, NSCC, DTC, CDS, LCH, Cboe Clear Europe, Cboe Clear U.S., JSCC, ASX Clear Pty Ltd, and SIX x-clear were unable to allow or perform clearing services for existing or new products, change the terms of their clearing services, their clearing members were unable or unwilling to clear through them, or OCC’s technology migration is not successful, fewer transactions could occur on our markets or transactions could likely not occur on our markets or there may be delays, including until clearing is moved to another clearing agency. In 2024, approximately 69% of our net transaction and clearing fees were generated by options and futures that were cleared through OCC. See other Risk Factors for additional information regarding revenue concentration and below for additional information regarding OCC’s recent margin requirement proposal.\n•\nOPRA, UTP Securities Information Processor and the CTA consolidate options and equities market information, respectively, such as last sale reports and quotations. If any of them were unable to provide this information for a sustained period of time, we may be unable to offer trading on our options and equities markets.\n•\nWe are heavily dependent on technology for our markets, including third-party operation of production and disaster recovery data centers, as well as certain communications and networking products and services. If this technology is unavailable, as a result of a number of potential causes, including technical failure, failure to successfully complete technological migrations, natural disasters, extreme weather events, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent, and cannot be replaced in a sufficiently short time period, we may be unable to operate our markets.\n34\nTable \no\nf Contents\n•\nWe utilize third-party cloud service providers to maintain secondary offsite backups of our and our customers’ data and to distribute real-time data, and we may utilize third-party cloud service providers in the future for additional services. We do not control the operations of third-party cloud service providers or their facilities and may be vulnerable to disruptions in our access to the platform as a result of a number of potential causes, including technical failure, natural disasters, extreme weather events, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent. Additionally, any vulnerability of third-party cloud service providers could expose our or our customers’ confidential data, which could result in harm to our business reputation.\n•\nFINRA and OCC provide certain regulatory services and functions for our options, equities and futures exchanges, while we retain regulatory responsibilities for such services. If FINRA or OCC stopped providing services, or provided inadequate services, we may be subject to action by the SEC or CFTC, or may have limitations placed upon our markets.\n•\nWe rely on FINRA CAT LLC, a subsidiary of FINRA, to provide services for the implementation of the CAT. If FINRA CAT LLC or its third-party service providers stop providing services or provide inadequate services, we and the other SROs may not be able to recover costs related to the implementation of CAT, incur penalties for delays of implementation, incur related litigation and other expenses, or incur regulatory liability including enforcement action by the SEC or limitations placed upon our markets. In addition, if CATLLC is no longer able to collect fees from Industry Members as a result of litigation or regulatory developments, the SROs may not be able to collect on the promissory notes related to the funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT. See Note 8 (\"Credit Losses\"), Note 9 (\"Other Assets, Net\"), and Note 23 (\"Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees — Legal Proceedings\") for further information. \n•\nWe rely on third party routing and clearing firms to clear trades in U.S. listed equity securities routed by us to other markets, and to execute trades in options that we route to other markets. \nOCC has proposed to establish a margin add-on charge (“Intraday Risk Charge”) for all clearing member accounts to help mitigate the risks arising from intraday and overnight trading activity. If the Intraday Risk Charge is applied as currently proposed by OCC, clearing members’ costs associated with clearing our products, including SPX options, through OCC may increase, which may result in lower trading volumes on our exchanges and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. An interruption or malfunction in or the cessation or impairment of an important service by a third party or disruption of a third party’s operations could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services, make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business, cause us to experience the loss of a significant number of market participants or cause us to experience a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, our inability to make alternative arrangements, such as moving clearing to another clearing agency, in a timely manner, or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nIf an index provider from which we have a license or a service provider with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices or fails to perform under our agreements with them, if we fail to maintain the quality and integrity of our proprietary indices or indices and other values that we calculate for customers, or if customer preferences change, the revenues that are generated from the trading of proprietary products or the calculation and dissemination of index values may suffer.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements that permit us to list tradeable products related to various indices that are among the most actively traded products on our exchanges. We also enter into agreements pursuant to which we act as an index provider and calculate and disseminate proprietary indices and other values. We believe that demand for our products is based in part on market perception of the quality and integrity of these indices. The quality and integrity of these indices are dependent on the ability of index providers, including us, to properly maintain the indices. Maintenance includes ongoing index calculation and index rebalancing, and depends on data providers for a number of things, including the timely provision of accurate input data. We also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indices and uses of the indices that infringe on our licenses. Some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products obligate the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us. If any of our index providers, including us, are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of indices, or if any of the index providers or service providers, including us, fail to perform their obligations under the agreements, trading in derivative products, and therefore transaction fees we receive, may be materially adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated. \nDifferences in the calculations from methodologies described in published materials or incorrect calculations of our indices or the failure to implement any planned remedial changes may result in the loss of perceived quality and integrity of our indices, loss of demand for our products, increased potential for investigations and enforcement proceedings, increased potential for failure to perform our obligations under agreements concerning our products or in our capacity as an index \n35\nTable \no\nf Contents\nprovider, and increased exposure to third party claims and related litigation expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may not effectively manage our growth, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe expect that our business will continue to grow, which may place a significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. We must continually improve our operational, billing, financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures, and may need to continue to expand, train and manage our workforce. We must also maintain close coordination among our technology, legal, accounting, finance, marketing, sales, regulatory and compliance functions. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially harmed.\n \nFor example, from time to time we discover and remediate billing errors, however, we are not aware of any of these errors having a material impact on our business, financial condition or operating results to date, however we cannot assure you that we will not experience future errors or events that may be material or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Furthermore, failure to successfully expand into new asset classes, such as SFT, or new geographies may materially adversely affect our growth strategy and our future profitability. \nOur continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology, facilities, personnel, and financial and management systems and controls. It also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations, and we will need to integrate, train and manage a growing employee base. The expansion of our existing businesses, any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes, which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required. We may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary. Further, unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nOur global operations are complex and subject us to increased business and economic risks that could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition to our operations in the U.S., we have operations in the UK, continental Europe, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Japan, Philippines, and Singapore. In connection with our expanded global operations, we face certain risks inherent in doing business globally. These risks include:\n•\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n•\ncomplying with extensive and complex compliance requirements, regulations and oversight by regulators other than our primary functional regulators;\n•\ndifficulties in staffing and associated costs in managing multiple international locations;\n•\ngeneral economic, social, and political conditions, including the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East;\n•\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in some countries;\n•\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n•\ndifferent technology platforms;\n•\nlanguage and cultural differences; \n•\npotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n•\nnatural disasters and extreme weather events that may impact global operations differently. \nIf we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, or if the risks above become substantial for us, our financial performance and operating results could suffer. Further, any measures we may implement to reduce risks of our global operations may not be effective, may increase our expenses and may require significant management time and effort. \nMore specifically, we have exposure to exchange rate movements between the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Philippine Peso, and the Singapore dollar against the U.S. dollar. Significant inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic or political conditions, acts of war or terrorism, changes in governmental monetary or tax policy, or changes in local interest rates. These exchange rate differences would affect the translation of our non-U.S. results of operations and financial condition into U.S. dollars as part of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 16 (\"Segment Reporting\") for additional information about the Company’s geographic exposure.\nWe and our licensors may not be able to protect our respective intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, proprietary products, index methodologies and other proprietary rights. In addition, we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusively-licensed index options and futures products. We and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying, or \n36\nTable \no\nf Contents\notherwise obtaining and using, our intellectual property without authorization, listing our proprietary or exclusively-licensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights. We and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. We and our licensors may not be successful in this regard. Such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us, diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks, including credit, liquidity, market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties, and risks related to investing of collateral.\nWe are subject to risks related to operating our European clearinghouse, Cboe Clear Europe, and Cboe Clear U.S., the clearinghouse through which we facilitate the clearing of cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures, including the risks of failing to meet strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight, risks of default by clearing participants and counterparties, due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons, the risks associated with the adequacy of participants’ margin, default and interoperable funds, and risks related to investing of such funds. These risks could subject our business to substantial losses, reputational harm, regulatory consequences, including litigation, fines and enforcement actions, and the inability to operate our business.\nTo mitigate the credit risks related to defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties, including the market risk that we would only be able to close out a defaulting participant’s positions at a loss, there are minimum participation criteria to become a clearing participant and clearing participants are required to provide collateral to cover the margin requirement and default fund contributions and in the case of certain clearing participants with SFT without margin or default fund obligations, to grant Cboe Clear Europe title to or security over certain assets covering their obligations. Furthermore, Cboe Clear Europe interoperates with two central counterparties and requires its applicable participants to make deposits to an interoperable fund, which are pledged to the interoperable central counterparties. No guarantee can be given that the collateral or other assets provided will at all times be sufficient, maintain its value, or provide absolute assurance against us experiencing financial losses from defaults by the participants or counterparties on their obligations. In addition, although such collateral is preferably held in European central banks, Cboe Clear Europe also holds collateral in central securities depositories, in particular in the case of other assets for SFT, and commercial banks, which can expose us to risk of default by those institutions, and invests cash collateral in accordance with its investment policy, such as in securities issued by pre-approved sovereign issuers and reverse repurchase agreements with overnight maturities, which expose us to risk of counterparty default which may result in losses and cause its clearing participants to lose confidence in our clearinghouse.\nCboe Clear Europe entered into a €1.20 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility that is available to be drawn by Cboe Clear Europe towards (a) financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through Cboe Clear Europe’s clearing system and (b) financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of Cboe Clear Europe incurred in the operation of its clearing system, however we can give no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet all such obligations or sufficiently mitigate Cboe Clear Europe’s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due. Substantial amounts of the collateral, and any amounts drawn under this facility, may be at risk if a clearing participant defaults on its obligations to our clearinghouse and its margin, default and interoperability fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations. This facility is expected to terminate on June 27, 2025 and we may not be able to enter into a replacement facility on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, investment losses in excess of capital set aside by Cboe Clear Europe for counterparty risk are allocated back to clearing participants. We cannot assure you that the mitigating measures, policies, safeguards and risk management procedures will be sufficient to detect problems or to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. \nComputer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur business depends on the integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems. If our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform, as a result of a number of potential causes, including technical failure, natural disasters, extreme weather events, flooding, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent, and cannot be replaced in a sufficiently short time period, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services. These consequences could result in trading outages, lower trading and clearing volumes, financial losses, decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. Although we have a back-up plan with respect to our significant trading and key corporate systems, the back-up systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cyber-security breach. Despite having disaster recovery facilities, there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient, transparent and liquid marketplace, if we can open at all, nor can we guarantee that clearing organizations will allow clearing services for existing or new products following a systems failure or cyber-security breach. Moreover, with extended trading hours, we must operate our systems longer and have fewer non-trading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely.\n37\nTable \no\nf Contents\nOur markets and clearinghouses have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and in the future our systems may fail, in whole or in part, or may operate slowly, causing one or more of the following:\n•\nunanticipated disruption in trading of our exclusively listed proprietary products or in service to our participants;\n•\nfailures or delays during peak trading times or times of unusual market volatility;\n•\nslower response times and delays in trade execution, clearing and processing;\n•\nincomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording, clearing or processing of trades; and\n•\ndistribution of inaccurate or untimely market data to participants who rely on this data in their trading activity.\nAny of these events may cause:\n•\na loss in transaction, clearing or other fees due to the inability to provide trading in our exclusively listed proprietary products or provide services for a time;\n•\nrequests by market participants or others that we reimburse them for financial loss, either within the constraints of the limited liability provisions of our exchanges’ rules or in excess of those amounts;\n•\ntrading and clearing volumes to diminish on our markets and clearinghouse due to dissatisfaction with the platforms; and\n•\none or more of our regulators to investigate or take enforcement action against us.\nAs a consequence of any of these events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.\nIn addition to other measures, we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading and clearing activity or times of unusual market volatility. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading or clearing volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading or clearing volume without failure or degradation of performance. \nWe anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware, software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic, technology migrations, and system updates. Additionally, disruptions to the supply chain may interfere with the ability of our employees, vendors, technology equipment suppliers, data and disaster recovery centers, and other service providers to provide the requested hardware, software, and telecommunications infrastructure. If we cannot migrate, update, or increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate increased trading or clearing activity and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be materially adversely affected. \nOur use of open source software code may subject our software to general release or require us to re\n-\nengineer our software, which could harm our business.\nOur technology platform uses open source software code. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. In addition, some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Open source license terms may be ambiguous, and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated. We believe that our use of open source software is in compliance with the relevant open source software licenses and does not require disclosure of any of our source code. However, if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, reengineer or discontinue use of our software or take other remedial action any or all of which could cause disruptions in, or impose significant costs on, our business.\nDamage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe believe one of our competitive strengths is our strong industry reputation. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk, including issues relating to: \n•\nthe representation of our business in the media;\n•\nthe quality and benefits of using our proprietary products, including the reliability, integrity and functionality of our transaction-based businesses and index calculations and the accuracy of our market data;\n•\nthe ability to execute our business plan, key initiatives or new business ventures and the ability to keep up with changing customer demands and regulatory initiatives;\n•\nour regulatory compliance and our enforcement of compliance on our customers;\n•\nthe accuracy of our customer billing, financial statements, and other financial and statistical information;\n•\nthe quality of our corporate governance structure;\n38\nTable \no\nf Contents\n•\nthe quality of our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, including any failures in supervision; \n•\nthe integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems;\n•\nthe ability to successfully complete technology migrations;\n•\nthe failure to successfully expand into new asset classes, such as SFT or U.S. Treasuries, or new geographies;\n•\nsecurity breaches, including any unauthorized delivery of proprietary data to third parties;\n•\nmanagement of our outsourcing relationships, including our relationship with FINRA and NFA;\n•\nany misconduct or fraudulent activity by our employees, especially senior management, or other persons formerly or currently associated with us;\n•\nour listings business and our enforcement of our listing rules; and\n•\nany negative publicity surrounding the corporate equities or ETPs that we serve as the listing destination.\nDamage to our reputation could cause a reduction in the trading volume of our proprietary products or on our markets or cause us to lose customers. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nA limited number of customers comprise a material portion of our revenues, and the loss of key customers or a significant reduction in trading or clearing volumes by key customers could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, which tend to be market makers, liquidity providers, proprietary traders, and global banks. For example, in 2024, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 50% of our revenues. This revenue was spread across various global regions and business segments and our customers are not subject to agreements that prohibit them from reducing or ceasing their transactions with us with little or no warning and without penalty. In addition, from time to time, certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in various of our individual products or business segments, and a substantial decrease in their trading activity could have a negative impact on the liquidity of the particular product or business segment. The loss of, or a significant reduction in trading or clearing volumes by, one or more of our key customers could result in a decrease in our transaction and clearing fees, reduce the revenue we generate from sales of market data and negatively impact the liquidity of certain of our products, which could result in a material impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWith respect to options, all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of OCC. As of December 31, 2024, there were 115 TPHs that are clearing members of OCC. Three clearing members accounted for approximately 79% of transaction and other fees collected through OCC in 2024. Additionally, the three largest clearing members clear the majority of the market-maker sides of transactions at Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX and at all of the options exchanges. Should one of these clearing members or liquidity providers exit the business or withdraw from our options exchanges, impose additional market-maker financial requirements or if market-makers were unable to transfer to another clearing member or other liquidity providers were unable to provide additional liquidity, this could create a significant disruption to the options markets, including ours, which could result in lower volumes on our exchanges and thereby have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFinancial or other problems experienced by third parties could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, clearing agents and counterparties. For example, we are exposed to credit risk for transaction fees we bill to customers on a monthly basis in arrears. Our customers and other third parties may default on their obligations to us due to a lack of liquidity, operational failure, bankruptcy or other reasons. For additional credit risks related to our clearinghouse operations, see the Risk Factor “Our clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks, including credit, liquidity, market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties and risks related to investing of collateral.” \nIn addition, with respect to orders Cboe Trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers, Cboe Trading is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing equities and options transactions on our behalf, as well as failure on the part of such brokers to pass back any transactional rebates. Wedbush and Morgan Stanley guarantee equity trades until the trade has been submitted to and validated by NSCC, after which time NSCC provides a guarantee until the trade settles (T+1). Thus, Cboe Trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to an equity trade routed to another market center until the trade has been processed and validated by NSCC on the trade date in the event that Wedbush or Morgan Stanley fails to perform. Additionally, BIDS Trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to BOA related to clearing until the trade has been processed and validated by the NSCC on the trade date. With respect to U.S. listed equity options and futures, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the OCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and CFE, and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades. With respect to Canadian equities, we deliver reports of matched trades of our customers to CDS, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Canada Inc. and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched Canadian equities trades. With respect to trades in options and futures occurring on Cboe Europe Derivatives, Cboe Clear Europe acts as a central counterparty that, for its clearing participants, becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. As a result, Cboe Clear Europe guarantees the timely performance of the \n39\nTable \no\nf Contents\nsettlement obligations of buyers and sellers and takes on the risk of the performance of the transactions that it clears. With respect to Australian equities and derivatives, we deliver matched trades of our customers to ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Settlement Pty Ltd. ASX Clear Pty Ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Australia and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in Australia. With respect to Japanese equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the JSCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Japan and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in Japan. With respect to trades in digital asset futures occurring on Cboe Digital Exchange, we deliver matched trades of our customers to Cboe Clear U.S., which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Digital Exchange and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of those matched futures trades.\nWith respect to routed U.S. equity transactions, Cboe Trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to Wedbush and Morgan Stanley related to clearing until the trade has been processed and validated by the NSCC on the trade date. Cboe Trading uses Wedbush to clear trades routed through affiliates of Bank of America Corporation as well as for trades routed directly to other exchanges and optionally dark pools. Morgan Stanley clears trades routed through the Morgan Stanley routing brokers and also clears executions routed to most dark pools. Cboe Trading maintains counterparty credit risk exposure from routing brokers with respect to rebates earned until completion of the routing brokers next invoice cycle following the execution.\nWith respect to U.S. listed equity and exchange traded product options, Cboe Trading is subject to counterparty credit risk exposure with respect to rebates earned from routing brokers until completion of the routing brokers’ next invoice cycle following the execution. \nOur exposure to credit risk may be further impacted by volatile securities markets that may affect the ability of our customers, counterparties and other third parties to satisfy their obligations to us. Moreover, we may not be successful in managing our credit risk through mitigating measures, policies, safeguards and risk management procedures, reporting and control procedures or by maintaining credit standards. Any losses arising from such defaults or other credit losses could materially adversely affect our financial condition, and operating results. \nWhile neither Cboe FX nor Cboe SEF has direct counterparty risk, Cboe FX or Cboe SEF may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event. Therefore, Cboe FX and Cboe SEF may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade spot FX on the Cboe FX platform, or NDFs on Cboe SEF. \nWe may be required to assume ownership of a position in securities in connection with our order routing service, which could subject us to trading losses when our broker-dealer disposes of that position.\nWe offer a smart-order routing service through our broker-dealer subsidiary, Cboe Trading, which provides its customers with access to other market centers when we route their orders to those market centers for execution. In connection with this service, we may assume ownership of a position in securities. This may occur, for example, when a market center to which we have routed a customer’s order experiences systemic issues and is unable to determine the status of that order. When this happens, we may make a business decision to provide a cancellation notice to our customer, relieving our customer of any liability with respect to the order. We may be informed later, however, that the order was executed at the market center to which we routed it, in which case Cboe Trading would be required to take ownership of that securities position. Our third-party clearing brokers maintain error accounts on behalf of Cboe Trading into which such positions settle, and we require the respective clearing broker to trade out of those positions as expeditiously as possible, which could result in our incurring trading losses.\nWe selectively explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses, products or technologies. We may not be successful in integrating other businesses, products or technologies with our business. Any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our Company. We may enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or alliances, any of which may be material. The market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive, which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities. If we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment, financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders, whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock. \nThe process of integration, including in new geographies and asset classes with new regulatory regimes, may expose us to a number of unforeseen risks and operating difficulties, including risks relating to information technology migrations, integrations and security, regulatory issues, and other issues, and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm our reputation. We may not successfully achieve the integration objectives, and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings, revenue growth and synergies in full or at all, or it may take longer to realize them than expected, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. For example, in \n40\nTable \no\nf Contents\nMay 2024, we halted trading on the Cboe Digital spot market, our spot digital asset trading platform, in-line with our plans to wind down the spot digital asset trading market and refocus the digital asset business to leverage Cboe’s core strengths in derivatives, technology and product innovation.\nFurther, the success of acquisitions, integrations, and future operations may also depend in part on our ability to retain following acquisitions key employees of acquired companies or find suitable candidates to replace such key employees who leave. If we are unable to retain such key employees, including management, we could face disruptions in our operations, integrations, loss of customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. \nOur decision to wind down the Cboe Digital spot crypto market may negatively impact our digital asset business.\nIn April 2024, we announced plans to wind down the spot crypto market offered by Cboe Digital and transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts currently listed on Cboe Digital Exchange to CFE, pending regulatory review. On May 31, 2024, we halted all trading on the Cboe Digital spot market. The Cboe Digital spot market is closed for all participant and trading purposes. The Company expects to maintain the derivatives clearing services currently operated by Cboe Clear U.S., integrating these functions and teams into the existing organizational structure. The Company has brought Cboe Clear U.S. under unified leadership with the Global Head of Clearing. In connection with shutting down the spot crypto exchange, the Company also determined to unwind the minority ownership structure in Cboe Digital. Our decision to wind down the Cboe Digital spot crypto market may adversely impact our ability to develop new products based on digital assets, including the development and distribution of digital asset indices for potential use in exchange traded products and other derivative product opportunities. The wind down could impact our reputation within the digital asset industry and negatively impact the demand for our Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts. We expect competition to increase as existing and new competitors introduce new products or enhance existing products and the wind down of the spot crypto market may impact how market participants perceive us. In addition, we may not be able to successfully transition Cboe Digital Exchange’s cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts to CFE and integrate the clearing services currently operated by Cboe Clear U.S. into the existing organizational structure.\nCboe Digital’s clearinghouse operations are exposed to risks, including credit, liquidity, market and other risks related to the potential defaults of clearing members and other counterparties.\nCboe Digital is subject to risks related to operating its clearinghouse, Cboe Clear U.S., which is a derivatives clearing organization (“DCO”) registered with the CFTC. Risks associated with the operation of Cboe Clear U.S. include failing to meet strict business continuity and financial resources requirements and regulatory oversight, risks of default by clearing members and counterparties due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Trading in Bitcoin and Ether futures with margin treatment began in January 2024 and we could experience losses in excess of the collateral, which may have an adverse effect on our business, if a clearing participant defaults on its obligations to our clearinghouse, and its margin and its guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures, fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.\nCboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA are registered national securities exchanges and SROs, and, as such, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the SEC. CFE is a DCM and Cboe SEF is a SEF, each registered with the CFTC and subject to comprehensive regulation by the CFTC. In addition to its other SRO responsibilities, BZX, as a listing market, also is responsible for evaluating applications submitted by issuers interested in listing their securities on BZX and monitoring each issuer’s compliance with BZX’s continued listing standards. The Exchanges may be subject to additional responsibilities in other international jurisdictions where the Exchanges may be authorized to act as foreign exchanges. Failure to comply with these SRO and other regulatory responsibilities could result in potential sanctions or fines and a negative impact on Cboe’s reputation and/or branding. \nOur European businesses are subject to regulatory oversight in the UK by the FCA and in the Netherlands by the DNB and the AFM, which, through the “passporting” regime, provides authorization to carry on business in other Member States of the EU and the EEA in accordance with the applicable EU legislation and regulation to which our European business is subject. Cboe Canada Inc. is subject to regulatory oversight in Canada by its primary provincial securities authority, the OSC. In addition, Cboe Canada Inc. is a Marketplace Member of, and subject to a regulation services agreement with, CIRO. Cboe Australia is subject to regulatory oversight in Australia by the ASIC. Cboe Japan is subject to regulatory oversight in Japan by the JFSA and the JSDA. BIDS Trading is a registered broker-dealer subject to regulatory oversight in the U.S. by the SEC and FINRA and is maintained as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the SROs. The President of BIDS Trading leads BIDS Trading as an independent business within Cboe, reporting into an independent committee of the Board of Directors of Cboe Global Markets. If a regulatory authority makes a finding of non-compliance, conditional fines could be imposed, and our licenses could be revoked. Any such fine or revocation of a license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. The Cboe Digital futures exchange (Cboe Digital Exchange) and clearinghouse (Cboe Clear U.S.) are regulated by \n41\nTable \no\nf Contents\nthe CFTC and subject to comprehensive regulation by the CFTC. Cboe Clear U.S. has surrendered or is in the process of surrendering its money transmitter licenses in the states where such licenses or equivalent were required to conduct business in connection with the Cboe Digital spot market, which closed on May 31, 2024. In addition, Cboe Clear U.S. has surrendered its BitLicense from the NYDFS.\nIn addition to the requirements related to operating our U.S. markets imposed by the SEC and the CFTC, we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the TPHs and members that trade on our Exchanges. While we have entered into agreements under which FINRA, with respect to our options and equities exchanges provides certain regulatory services, and under which OCC, with respect to CFE provides certain financial surveillance and regulatory services, we retain ultimate responsibility for the regulation of our TPHs and members. We have begun to perform internally more of the regulatory services that FINRA used to handle. \nOur ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the ability of FINRA and OCC to perform under their respective regulatory services agreements, the ability of FINRA and OCC to transition to us any other potential responsibilities under their respective regulatory services agreements, our ability to complete the new additional responsibilities for regulating our TPHs and members and our oversight of the work done by FINRA and OCC. The SEC and CFTC have broad powers to audit, investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by, as applicable, SROs, DCOs, DCMs and SEFs pursuant to applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nIf a regulatory authority were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient, our SROs, DCM, or SEF could be the subject of investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions, including revocation of registration as a national securities exchange, DCM, or SEF. Any such investigations or proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources, including management time, and potential harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, our SROs, DCM, or SEF may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment, or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions, each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate.\nIn addition, SROs are required by federal law to perform a variety of regulatory functions. In light of these responsibilities, some courts have held that SROs are immune to certain private causes of action relating to the performance of these regulatory functions. There is a risk that some courts may not apply this immunity doctrine to all claims. There is also a risk that legislative or regulatory developments may change the application of this immunity doctrine. Limitations on the application of the immunity doctrine could result in an increased exposure to litigation, and increase liability and/or other legal expenses. Further under the CEA, CFE, Cboe SEF, Cboe Clear U.S. and Cboe Digital Exchange may be subject to litigation alleging that they have acted in bad faith. We also could be exposed to liability to regulators or other governmental authorities even in situations where immunity would bar a civil claim.\nLegislative or regulatory changes affecting our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nChanges in regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FCA, DNB, AFM, CIRO, OSC, ASIC, JFSA, JSDA, other domestic and foreign regulators or other government action, including approval by these regulators of rule filings or initiatives by other SROs or entities, including OCC, could materially affect our markets, products and clearinghouse. In recent years, the securities and derivatives industries have been subject to regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny of the securities and derivatives industries. We have also experienced, and we may continue to experience due to changes in administrations in the jurisdictions that we operate and expansion into other asset classes, such as SFT, and geographies, an increase in rulemaking and legislation that could affect our business.\nIn particular, in December 2022, the SEC released four proposals that could impact equity market structure: (1) Disclosure of Order Execution Information (Rule 605); (2) Regulation NMS Amendments: Tick Size, Access Fees, and Transparency; (3) Regulation Best Execution; and (4) Proposed Rule to Enhance Order Competition. Each of these proposals have been noticed for public comment, and in 2024, Rule 605 and the Tick Size/Access Fee Cap proposals were approved by the SEC and await implementation. Rule 605 and Tick Size/Access Fee Cap rule may result in increased technology and compliance costs to Cboe. This rule is also likely to result in increased technology and compliance or challenge costs to Cboe, as well as potential adverse impact to Cboe’s trading volume and transaction fee revenue. The SEC has yet to take any additional action on Regulation Best Execution and Order Competition, but if adopted as-is, these proposals could result in market technology changes and additional compliance costs to Cboe, and have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Further, on October 18, 2023, the SEC released the Volume Based Proposal and, although the proposed new rules do not appear likely to have a potential near term material impact, the new rules, if adopted as-is, may have a long term material impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results if, for example, there is a reduction of overall volumes, liquidity, or market share on Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA. See Note 23 (“Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees — Legal Proceedings”) for more information.\n42\nTable \no\nf Contents\nUnder EU and UK regulations, European and UK banks and other European and UK financial institutions become subject to punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a third country central counterparty (“CCP”) that is not recognized in the applicable jurisdiction. OCC is recognized as a third country CCP by the EU and is currently operating under the UK’s temporary recognition regime. Although the UK has not issued any equivalency determination with respect to U.S. CCPs, OCC has submitted its application for permanent recognition in the UK. The current deadline for recognition in the UK is December 31, 2025, and may be extended by His Majesty’s Treasury in the future in increments of 12 months each. As a prerequisite to ultimately achieving recognition in the UK, it is possible that OCC could be required by the UK to contribute capital to its default waterfall applicable in the event of clearing member default. This capital could be required to be drawn before the default fund contributions of non-defaulting clearing members in the event that a defaulting clearing member’s margin and other contributions were to be exhausted. OCC’s stockholders, including Cboe Options, could effectively be required to fund this capital. If the UK does not recognize OCC as a third country CCP, then UK market participants that clear through OCC would become subject to punitive capital charges. As a result, we could experience the loss of a significant number of UK market participants and a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nThe implementation of MiFID II and MiFIR in Europe at the beginning of 2018 has encouraged competition among market centers in Europe. MiFID II and MiFIR have introduced a number of new rules, including enhanced internal organizational and compliance monitoring requirements, which apply directly to European trading venues such as our MTF and RM. The impact of MiFID II and MiFIR is significant, and the increased competition among market centers could reduce trading fees, while increasing our costs of operating in Europe. Additionally, European authorities are currently undertaking a review of MiFID as a result of which new rules may come into effect that could have a material impact on our business.\nIn 2021 the E.C. published proposals for the review of EU market structure, including provisions for a consolidated tape for the EU and changes to the transparency regime for equities. These proposals are expected to be implemented during 2026. As proposed, these new rules may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which the spot FX market operates is evolving and has undergone significant changes in the recent past, and there may be future regulatory changes in the spot FX industry. The FX Global Code was published in 2017, and re-affirmed in 2021, and sets forth standards of conduct agreed by market participants and central banks on a global basis to apply to the wholesale FX market, and the effect of its publication on conduct and future regulation continues to evolve. Cboe FX issued a Statement of Commitment declaring its commitment to conduct its FX market activities in a manner consistent with the principles of the FX Global Code. Amendments to the FX Global Code, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by applicable governmental bodies and regulatory organizations, or the adoption of new legal or regulatory requirements, may also adversely affect our spot FX business. Further, our FX NDF business may also be adversely affected by proposed regulatory changes to the rules governing swap execution facilities.\nIt is also possible that there will be additional legislative, regulatory, and enforcement changes, priorities or efforts in the environment in which we operate, or plan to operate, our businesses. Actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the U.S. or internationally and other proposals could have a material impact on our business. \nIn addition, U.S. and foreign legislatures and regulators could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could materially adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the securities industry at all. Any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants’ trading activity on our Exchanges and markets. \nAny infringement by us on intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur competitors, as well as others, have obtained, or may obtain, patents or may otherwise hold intellectual property rights that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We may not be aware of all intellectual property that may pose a risk of infringement by our products, services or technologies. In addition, some potential patent applications in the U.S. are confidential until a patent is issued, and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products, services or technologies may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications. Thus, we cannot be sure that our products, services or technologies do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us. Claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry, and even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management resources and attention. If one or more of our products, services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another party, we may be required to pay damages, stop using, developing or marketing those products, services or technologies, obtain a license from the intellectual property rights holders, or redesign those products, services or technologies to avoid infringement. If we were required to stop using, developing or marketing certain products, services or technologies, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially harmed. Moreover, if we \n43\nTable \no\nf Contents\nwere unable to obtain required licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products, services or technologies to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nMisconduct by our TPHs, members, participants or others could harm us. \nWe run the risk that our TPHs, members, participants, other persons who use our markets or our products, other persons for whom we clear transactions, our employees or those with which we have business relationships may engage in fraud, market or product manipulation, or other misconduct, which could result in regulatory and legal sanctions and penalties and serious harm to our reputation, especially because we are the parent company of SROs and other markets. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, or market or product manipulation, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. In addition, misconduct, or market or product manipulation by, or failures of, participants on our or other markets may discourage trading on our Exchanges, our other markets, or of our products, which could reduce revenues.\nManaging our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business.\nAs a competitive business with regulatory responsibilities, we are responsible for disciplining TPHs and members for violating our rules, including by imposing fines and sanctions. This may create competing interests between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities. Any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the SEC or CFTC to take action against us, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. \nBIDS Trading’s ability to operate under its current regulatory framework is dependent upon the sufficiency of a novel operational and governance framework we have developed to govern our relationship with BIDS Trading and our ability to comply with such framework and if we fail to adhere to such framework or the BIDS Trading ATS is otherwise deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nThe U.S. equities ATS operated by BIDS Trading is regulated as a broker-dealer sponsored alternative trading system and not a registered national securities exchange. Because we acquired BIDS Trading, it is now under common ownership with our registered national securities exchanges that, in some cases, offer trading in the same securities as those traded on the BIDS Trading ATS. Absent sufficient separation, this common ownership of an ATS and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities presents the potential for the BIDS Trading ATS to be deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges. If the BIDS Trading ATS were to be deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, certain exchange regulations could be extended to the BIDS Trading ATS, which could have a material adverse impact on BIDS Trading’s business model. This could reduce the BIDS Trading ATS’ competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the BIDS Trading ATS to us. This could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the BIDS Trading ATS as a “facility,” which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nTo mitigate the risk that the BIDS Trading ATS is deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, we have developed and implemented an operational and governance framework for our ownership of BIDS Trading that is intended to preserve the strategic, technological, business, and operational independence of the BIDS Trading ATS from our registered national securities exchange businesses, such that the BIDS Trading ATS and our registered national securities exchanges would not be deemed to be integrated or otherwise linked for “facility” purposes. This framework is supported by highly detailed policies, procedures and controls. However, because of the lack of precedent for common ownership of an ATS and registered national security exchanges offering trading in the same securities, there is risk that our framework and supporting policies, procedures and controls could be deemed to be insufficient to prevent the BIDS Trading ATS from being deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges. In addition, because of the comprehensive and highly detailed nature of our framework and supporting policies, procedures and controls, there is risk that we could inadvertently fail to fully adhere to our operational and governance framework and related policies, procedures and controls. There is also risk that new legislation or regulation, or changes in existing regulation or other government action, relating to “facilities” of registered national securities exchanges and/or the common ownership of an ATS and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities could materially affect our ability to own and operate the BIDS Trading ATS under the current operational and governance framework, including without the BIDS Trading ATS being deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges. Occurrence of any of the risks described in this paragraph could result in the BIDS Trading ATS being deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, which could reduce the BIDS Trading ATS’ competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the BIDS Trading ATS to us, and could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the BIDS Trading ATS as a “facility,” which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results\n.\n44\nTable \no\nf Contents\nIf our risk management and compliance methods are not effective, we may suffer adverse consequences, such as investigations and enforcement actions from regulators, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe maintain risk management, compliance and monitoring policies, procedures and programs that are reasonably designed to help with our compliance with applicable laws and rules and to prevent, detect, deter, monitor and manage our risks, including enterprise risk, compliance, regulatory, and internal audit programs, but such policies, procedures and programs may not be fully effective in their operation. Further, we face the risk of intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activity. In the case of actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in penalties, settlements or civil lawsuits, including by customers, or third parties, for damages, which may be substantial. For example, the SEC has previously brought actions against exchange operators, including us, for failing to fulfill their obligations to have an effective regulatory system. Further, as a result of ongoing risk management and related market surveillance review activities, we have identified, addressed, and continue to address potential market surveillance enhancement opportunities. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and rules could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results and, in extreme cases, our ability to conduct our business or portions thereof. As the parent company for SROs, other markets, and clearinghouses, we are responsible for maintaining markets that comply with securities and futures laws, SEC, FCA, AFM, DNB, CIRO, OSC, ASIC, JFSA, JSDA, ESMA, and CFTC regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges, markets and clearinghouses.\nWe have methods to identify, monitor and manage our risks. Management of legal, compliance, and regulatory risk, among other risks, requires policies and procedures to properly monitor and manage risk. Additionally, as we continue to integrate the technology, associates, and processes of acquisitions, we may not be able to identify additional risks. Further, the practices we utilize to integrate these acquisitions may not be effective at identifying or monitoring and managing risks related to ongoing integration activities. If our policies, procedures, and compliance systems are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed, our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective, or that our management, compliance department, risk department, regulatory department and related enterprise risk management framework, including the three lines of defense approach, and internal audit department would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness. If these departments or the enterprise risk management framework, and related policies and procedures are not effective, we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators, and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage.\nOur ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed by required regulatory review processes, which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes.\nOur Exchanges registered with the SEC must submit proposed rule changes to the SEC for its review and, in many cases, its approval. Even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the SEC, the SEC retains the right to suspend and disapprove such a rule change. Also, the CFTC may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for Cboe Clear U.S., Cboe Digital Exchange, CFE, or Cboe SEF. The rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets. If the SEC or CFTC delays, including because of a government shutdown, or does not allow one of our Exchanges to implement a rule change, this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities.\nSimilarly, the SEC must approve amendments to our exchange subsidiaries’ certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Cboe Global Markets. The SEC may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change, which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products. \nChanges in the tax laws and regulations affecting us, our offerings and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nLegislation may be enacted or interpretative guidance issued, both domestically and internationally, that could result in transaction, sales, or value added taxes on our offerings or change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets. A number of federal, state and local jurisdictions in the U.S. and EU Member States have considered a financial transaction tax, but to date such proposals have not resulted in legislation in our principal markets. Additionally, legislation has been proposed from time to time on a federal level that would introduce in the U.S. mark-to-market tax treatment for all derivatives contracts and require gains and losses be taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Further, tax authorities have issued interpretive guidance in the U.S. that, if prevailing, could expand the scope of our offerings that are subject to sales tax. Implementation of such taxes could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity, which would have a negative impact on our operations.\nIn addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants, like other corporations, we are subject to taxes at federal, state and local levels, as well as in non-U.S. jurisdictions. More specifically, some jurisdictions where we operate have implemented Pillar 2 laws to effectuate a 15% minimum tax. Changes in tax laws, regulations or policies or \n45\nTable \no\nf Contents\nsuccessful claims by tax authorities could result in our having to pay higher taxes, which would in turn reduce our net income. If this occurs, we may experience a higher effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to litigation risks and other liabilities.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of litigation and other liabilities. Although under current law we expect to be immune from private suits arising from conduct within our regulatory authority and from acts and forbearances incident to the exercise of our regulatory authority, we expect this immunity will only cover certain of our activities in the U.S., and we could be exposed to liability under foreign, national and local laws, court decisions and rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory agencies.\nSome of our other liability risks arise under the laws and regulations relating to the tax, employment, intellectual property, anti-money laundering, technology export, cybersecurity, foreign asset controls, foreign corrupt practices, employee labor and employment areas, including anti-discrimination and fair-pay laws and regulations, and the businesses of companies listed on any of our exchanges. Liability could also result from disputes over the terms of a trade executed on one of our markets, claims that a system failure or delay cost a customer money, claims we entered into an unauthorized transaction or claims that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction.\nFor example, we are subject to on-going legal and tax disputes that could result in the payment of fines, interest, penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report for a general description of our legal proceedings and claims, Note 21 (\"Income Taxes\"), and Note 23 (\"Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees\") to the consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for a summary of specific legal and tax proceedings.\nFurther, we could incur significant expenses vigorously defending the claims mentioned above (including those found to be barred due to immunity) and any future claims, even those without merit, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. The outcomes of existing claims and any future claims cannot be determined and an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change. \nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Indebtedness \nWe have outstanding indebtedness and commitments, which may decrease our business flexibility and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $648.6 million of senior unsecured notes due 2027, $495.5 million of senior unsecured notes due 2030, $296.9 million of senior unsecured notes due 2032, no funds outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and no funds outstanding under the Cboe Clear Europe Credit Facility.\n \nIn 2023, we terminated and paid off outstanding amounts under our term loan facility. The financial and other covenants to which we have agreed and our indebtedness may have the effect of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions. Further, we may default on our obligations or violate the covenants, in which case, we may be required to seek a waiver of such default or the debt obligations may be accelerated. A default under any of our indebtedness with cross default provisions could result in a default on our other indebtedness. Our indebtedness may also increase future borrowing costs, and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock, issue dividends, increase dividends or obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate requirements. We are also required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, regulatory capital requirements, and general corporate purposes. Also, our ability to fund capital expenditures and return capital to stockholders may depend on the amount of capital held due to regulatory capital requirements and the amount of capital committed related to lines of credit granted by the Company to our subsidiaries in connection with their regulatory capital requirements.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. \nWe may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially favorable terms, or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to affect such actions, if necessary, on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing consequences could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n46\nTable \no\nf Contents\nDeterioration in our credit profile may increase our costs of borrowing money.\nAs of December 31, 2024 we have investment grade credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings (A-) and Moody’s Investor Service (A3). Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There is no assurance that we will maintain such credit ratings, since credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade, our borrowing costs could increase. \nIf our goodwill, long-lived assets, investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets become impaired, the resulting charge to earnings may be significant.\nWe are required to assess investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired. In the future, we may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment.\n \nFor example, in 2022, the Company previously recorded goodwill impairment charges of $460.9 million related to Cboe Digital, resulting in decreases in the carrying value of Cboe Digital. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill, long-lived assets, intangible assets or investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the Company’s annual impairment analysis, completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, in which all reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value, we do not consider our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles to have a significant risk of impairment.\nAny decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon the earnings and cash flow of our operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAny decision to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount. The board’s determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and the SEC and other factors that the board deems relevant. As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, Cboe Global Markets depends entirely on distributions, if any, it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders. If these subsidiaries are not profitable, or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses, we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders. \nCertain provisions in our organizational documents and governing law could prevent or delay a change of control.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable, including discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control or any unsolicited acquisition proposals for us. These include provisions:\n•\nprohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent;\n•\nrequiring advance notice of director nominations and of business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders; and\n•\nrequiring that stockholders collectively hold at least 25% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock before they may request a special meeting.\nIn addition, our organizational documents include provisions that:\n•\nrestrict any person from voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 20% of our outstanding voting capital stock; and\n•\nrestrict any person from beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock.\nFurthermore, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval. Any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends, liquidation rights and, possibly, voting rights. The ability of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus materially adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nDelaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the board’s wishes. Under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a Delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder \n47\nTable \no\nf Contents\nfor a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances, including by approval of the corporation’s Board of Directors. \nFurthermore, the European countries where we operate regulated entities, such as the UK and Netherlands, may require prior governmental approval before an investor acquires 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock.",

    "item1c": "Item 1C.     Cybersecurity\nWe maintain policies, procedures and controls designed to safeguard against cybersecurity incidents by protecting the confidentiality, integrity, availability and reliability of our systems, networks and information. \nThese policies, procedures and controls are subject to monitoring, auditing, and evaluation practices, pursuant to our Enterprise Risk Management program, which is supported by a three-line defense strategy that includes, the business lines, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, the Risk Management and Information Security Department, the Compliance Department and the Internal Audit Department.\n Further, we have developed and conduct at least annually cybersecurity and data privacy training programs for our employees and our third-party consultants who have access to our systems. At least annually, we also conduct simulations, tabletop exercises, independent third-party cybersecurity penetration assessments, and response readiness tests. In addition, the information technology systems of our self-regulatory organizations are subject to periodic reviews, audits, and inspections by regulatory authorities. We also conduct diligence on cybersecurity practices in connection with our overall risk assessment when evaluating expansion into new regions, strategic opportunities, and new products.\nWe engage assessors, consultants, auditors and other third parties in connection with developing and evaluating our overall risk management framework.\n Additionally, our internal audit team periodically engages third parties to co-source internal audits of our information security processes. We strive to utilize best practices in our information security management and follow applicable industry standards.\nIn support of our risk management framework, we maintain a vendor management policy and program to manage third-party risk.\n Embedded in our vendor management policy is a defined process to assess the risks related to new vendors. Vendors deemed to be high risk are re-assessed annually. These assessments include security questionnaires and reviews of Service Organization Controls (SOC) Reports, where applicable. Cboe uses a third-party service to help monitor the security posture of our vendors that process and/or store confidential Cboe information.\nWe have committees, response and management teams, and dedicated positions for managing and assessing cybersecurity risk, including a Chief Information Security Officer, a Chief Risk Officer, an Enterprise Risk Management Committee, Computer Security Incident Response Team, Cyber Crisis Management Team, and a dedicated internal information security team. \nOur Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Risk Officer have extensive experience in the industry. Our Chief Information Security Officer has over a dozen years of experience leading information security programs including, experience in cybersecurity consulting, leading strategy and the implementation of cyber defenses for several of the top online retailers in the United States, as well as serving as Chief Information Security Officer for Cboe Digital Exchange and Cboe Clear U.S. Our Chief Information Security Officer is currently responsible for developing and executing the Company’s global security strategy and roadmap along with its long-range plan to meet industry and regional regulatory compliance requirements. We have an information security department with associates who are located around the globe. Our Chief Risk Officer’s tenure with Cboe spans 24 years, during which time he has held senior positions in information security and risk management. He is currently responsible for oversight of the Company’s risk function including the enterprise risk management, information security, privacy, vendor management, and IT asset management programs.\nOur incident response team is responsible for identifying potential cybersecurity incidents and communicating information regarding the nature and severity of the incident to senior management and others as required by the Company’s written Incident Response Plan. Cybersecurity incidents are tracked pursuant to our incident monitoring processes defined within the Incident Response Plan. Potential cybersecurity incidents may also be reported to our Disclosure Committee to determine if further action and/or public disclosure is required. We have also put in place a vulnerability management program through which our systems are routinely scanned to help identify vulnerabilities and track remediation activities.\nThe \nBoard\n recognizes that our business depends on the confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance, security, and reliability of our data and technology systems and devotes time and attention to the oversight of cybersecurity and information security risk. In particular, the Board’s Risk Committee receives recurring updates and reports on information security-related topics from senior management, including from the \nCompany’s Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and Chief Information Security Officer\n. More specifically, the Risk Committee receives recurring presentations from senior management on cybersecurity, including architecture and resiliency, incident management, business continuity and disaster recovery, significant information technology changes, data privacy, insider threats, physical security, information related to third-party cyber assessments and risks associated with the use of third party service providers. The Risk Committee also \n48\nTable \no\nf Contents\nreviews and approves any changes to the related information security and privacy program charter. Further, summaries of the proceedings from prior Risk Committee meetings are provided to the Board on a routine basis. Additionally, in 2024, the Board, along with senior management and third-party advisors, participated in a cybersecurity ransomware tabletop exercise.\nWe have experienced in the past, and we expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity threats and events of varying degrees. However, we are not aware of any of these threats or events having a material impact on our business or our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition results to date.\n We cannot assure you that we will not experience future threats or events that may be material. Please also refer to the risk factors above for additional information."
