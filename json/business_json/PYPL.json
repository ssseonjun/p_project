    "item1": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.” \nWe calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our business using prior period foreign exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues or operating expenses (as applicable) in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIn the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the year-over-year foreign exchange rate movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n(Unfavorable) favorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact)\n$\n(18)\n$\n128 \nHedging impact\n48 \n111 \nFavorable impact to net revenues \n30 \n239 \nFavorable (Unfavorable) impact to operating expense\n28 \n(29)\nNet favorable impact to operating income\n$\n58 \n$\n210 \nWhile we enter into foreign exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements, it is impossible to eliminate the total effects of this exposure.\nWe also use foreign exchange contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to reduce the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated.  \nGiven that we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional balance sheet foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts to help offset the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. \nAdditionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign exchange rates and when transactions occur. While we have processes in place to mitigate these risks, it is impossible to eliminate the total effects of any possible exposure associated with setting foreign exchange rates on our payments platform.\nKEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\nKEY METRICS\nTPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics (“key metrics”) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as follows:\n•\nTPV\n is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. \n•\nNumber of payment transactions\n is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. \n•\nAn\n \nactive account\n \nis an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s platform or services through such third-party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results. \n34\nTable of Contents\n•\nNumber of payment transactions per active account\n \nreflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account. \nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which may be indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors’ evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results.\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant judgment. \nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.  \nNET REVENUES\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n•\nTransaction revenues\n: \nNet transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the TPV completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We generate additional revenue from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees.\n•\nRevenues from other value added services:\n \nNet revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our consumers and merchants. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nOur revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors, including the following:\n \n•\nThe mix of merchants, products, and services;\n•\nThe mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;\n•\nThe geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and\n•\nThe amount of our loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants.\nRefer to “Part I,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks that our business faces.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in “Note 1\n—\nOverview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10\n‑\nK.\nA quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and such estimates require regular review and adjustment.\nALLOWANCE FOR TRANSACTION AND CREDIT LOSSES\nTransaction and credit losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances. Our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, product mix, current and projected macroeconomic conditions, merchant insolvency events, changes to and usage of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products, which include revolving and installment credit products offered to consumers at checkout, as well as merchant loans and advances arising from the PPWC and PPBL products.\nWe establish allowances for negative customer balances and estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, purchase protection program claims, account takeovers, and bank returns and reversals. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving collection and write-off patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types, as well as current and projected macroeconomic factors, as appropriate.\nWe also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable, which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivable and includes expected credit losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Determining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for loans and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for current expected credit losses at the balance sheet date after incorporating the impact of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we utilized externally published projections of forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, forecasted U.S. and U.K. retail e-commerce sales, and forecasted U.K. household disposable income, among others, over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The overall principal and interest coverage ratio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 7% and 9%, respectively. A significant change in the forecasted macroeconomic factors could result in a material change in our allowances. An increase of 1% in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowances by approximately $69 million based on the loans and interest receivable balance outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\n48\nTable of Contents\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES \nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through provisions such as the GILTI tax and base erosion anti-abuse tax. \nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. U.S. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest and penalties, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.\nBased on our results for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase in our income tax expense of $53 million would have resulted in a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nWe are regularly involved in various claims, regulatory and legal proceedings, and investigations of potential violations by regulatory oversight authorities. On a regular basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding, or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective and are based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation, or other violations and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may differ materially from the actual outcomes.\n49\nTable of Contents\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nApplication of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants. Evaluating whether these incentives are a payment to a customer, or consideration payable on behalf of a customer, requires judgment. Incentives determined to be made to a customer, or payable on behalf of a customer, are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded when earned, based on management’s estimate of each customer’s future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual customer performance, amendments to existing contracts, or the execution of new contracts. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. \nEVALUATION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT\nWe have strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities, which include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the Measurement Alternative). We review these investments regularly to determine if impairment has occurred. We assess whether an impairment loss on these non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies, has occurred based on qualitative factors such as the companies’ financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic or technological environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the company. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of these non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach. If any impairment is identified, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others. For sensitivity analysis performed on our strategic investments, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—\nEquity Investment Risk\n.”\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity investment risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and foreign exchange derivative activities intended to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. \nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 47% and 59%, respectively, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio (excluding restricted cash and strategic investments) was held in cash and cash equivalents.\n \nThe remaining portfolio and assets underlying the customer balances that we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in certain jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers.\nInterest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities and the fair value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities investment by approximately $101 million and $122 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities resulting from such interest rate changes are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and are realized only if we sell the securities prior to their scheduled maturities or the declines in fair values are due to expected credit losses.\n50\nTable of Contents\nAs of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had an aggregate principal amount of $10.6 billion in fixed rate debt with varying maturity dates. Since these notes bear interest at fixed rates, they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates. \nAs of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we also had revolving credit facilities of approximately $5.6 billion available to us. We are obligated to pay interest on borrowings under these facilities as well as other customary fees, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating. Borrowings under these facilities, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, ¥90.0 billion (approximately $574 million) and ¥50.0 billion (approximately $355 million), respectively, was outstanding under these facilities. A 100 basis points hypothetical adverse change in applicable market interest rates would not have resulted in a material impact to interest expense recorded in the period. For additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nInterest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss). \nFOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK\nWe have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, which subject us to foreign exchange risk and may adversely impact our financial results. We transact in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and expenses. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the United States (“U.S.”) dollar, and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies. We considered the historical trends in foreign exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. \nWe have a foreign currency exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign exchange contracts, please see “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe use foreign exchange contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiaries from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies and net investment hedges for accounting purposes. The derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI. Cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into revenue or expense in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The accumulated gains and losses associated with net investment hedges will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by a hypothetical 10% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $380 million and $622 million lower, respectively, before considering the offsetting impact of the underlying hedged item.\nWe have an additional balance sheet foreign currency management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts to help offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts.\n51\nTable of Contents\nAdverse changes in exchange rates of a hypothetical 10% for all foreign currencies would have resulted in a negative impact on income before income taxes of approximately $470 million and $417 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of foreign exchange contracts. Foreign exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2024 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $445 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $25 million. Foreign exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2023 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $400 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $17 million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to monetary assets, monetary liabilities, and available-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.\nEQUITY INVESTMENT RISK\nOur strategic investments are subject to a variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our strategic investments totaled $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion which represented approximately 10% and 11% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investment portfolio at those respective dates. Our strategic investments include marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. We are required to record all adjustments to the value of these strategic investments through our consolidated statements of income (loss). As such, we expect volatility to our net income (loss) in future periods due to changes in observable prices and impairment related to our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative. These changes could be material based on market conditions. Additionally, the financial success of our investments in privately held companies is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition, private sale, or other favorable market event providing the ability to realize appreciation in the value of the investment. A hypothetical adverse change of 10% in the carrying value of our strategic investments as of December 31, 2024, which could be experienced in the near term, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $156 million to the carrying value of the portfolio. We review our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent purchases and sales of securities, and other publicly available data, for which we assess factors such as the investees’ financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic, or technological environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investees.\nITEM 8.

Exhibits Required by Item 601 of Regulation S-K\n121\nThe information required by this Item is set forth in the Index of Exhibits that precedes the signature page of this Annual Report.\n55\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the\n \nBoard of Directors and Stockholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n56\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Consumer Loans Receivable\n \nAs described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the total allowance for loans and interest receivable was $461 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $341 million relates to consumer loans receivable. The allowance for consumer loans receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data and incorporates macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The consumer loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, loan term, delinquency, credit rating, vintage, and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario to reflect the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for consumer loans receivable is a critical audit matter are (i) a high degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to certain consumer loss models, and for the revolving credit portfolio, forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales used to estimate expected credit losses; and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for consumer loans receivable, including controls over certain consumer loss models, and for the revolving credit portfolio, forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales used to estimate expected credit losses. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for determining the allowance for consumer loans receivable; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in the estimate; and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of certain methodologies and consumer loss models used by management and (b) for the revolving credit portfolio, the reasonableness of forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales.\n/s/

Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1—\nOVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOVERVIEW AND ORGANIZATION\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015. At PayPal, our mission is to revolutionize commerce globally. Our products are designed to enable digital payments and simplify commerce experiences for consumers and merchants to make selling, shopping, and sending and receiving money simple, personalized, secure, online or offline, including mobile. Our two-sided platform serves millions of consumers and merchants worldwide.\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation and principles of consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of PayPal and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \nInvestments in entities where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, our share of the investee’s results of operations is included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Investments in entities where we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for at fair value or cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes, which are included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Our investment balances are included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe determine at the inception of each investment, and re-evaluate if certain events occur, whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”). If we determine an investment is in a VIE, we then assess if we are the primary beneficiary, which would require consolidation. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, \nno\n VIEs qualified for consolidation as the structures of these entities do not provide us with the ability to direct activities that would significantly impact their economic performance. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our investments in nonconsolidated VIEs was $\n187\n million and $\n175\n million, respectively, and is included as non-marketable equity securities applying the equity method of accounting in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets. The investments in nonconsolidated VIEs are primarily investments in funds that are limited partnerships or similar structures which are focused on increasing access to capital for underserved communities. Our maximum exposure to loss related to our nonconsolidated VIEs, which represents funded commitments and any future funding commitments, was $\n246\n million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.  \nCertain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n \n64\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction and credit losses, income taxes, loss contingencies, revenue recognition, and the evaluation of strategic investments for impairment. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and are comprised of primarily bank deposits, government and agency securities, and commercial paper.\nInvestments\nShort-term investments include time deposits and available-for-sale debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year when purchased or maturities of one year or less on the reporting date. Long-term investments include time deposits and available-for-sale debt securities with maturities exceeding one year on the reporting date, as well as our strategic investments. Our available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated tax provisions or benefits. \n \nWe elect to account for available-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, underlying funds receivable and customer accounts, short-term investments, and long-term investments, under the fair value option as further discussed in “Note 9—Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities.” The changes in fair value related to initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are included as a component of other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\nOur strategic investments consist of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, as well as equity method investments. Our investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the “Measurement Alternative”). Non-marketable equity securities also include our investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee and these securities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, and our share of earnings or losses from investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss). \nWe assess whether an impairment loss on our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative has occurred based on qualitative factors such as the companies’ financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic or technological environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the company. We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our equity method investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities or impairment is considered other-than-temporary for our equity method investments, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss). \n65\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nOur available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position are written down to fair value through a charge to other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss) if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, if we identify that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, taking into consideration changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies, implied yields versus benchmark yields, and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, among other factors, we estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any portion of impairment not related to credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\n \nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable is primarily related to revenue earned from customers and is reduced by an allowance for credit losses. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses was not significant. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nLoans and interest receivable, held for sale\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and other European buy now, pay later loan receivables, consisting of eligible loans and interest receivable and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans over a \n24\n-month commitment period (together, “eligible consumer installment receivables”). In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. Following the sale, the global investment firm becomes the owner of the eligible consumer installment receivables sold and we no longer hold an ownership interest in these receivables. \nThese sales of eligible consumer installment receivables to the global investment firm are accounted for as a true sale based on our determination that these receivables met all the necessary criteria for such accounting including legal isolation for transferred assets, ability of the transferee to pledge or exchange the transferred assets without constraint, and the transfer of control, and thus, we no longer record these receivables on our consolidated financial statements. We also concluded that our continuing involvement in the arrangement does not invalidate this determination. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of the consumer installment receivables sold and receive a market-based service fee for servicing the assets sold. \nPrior to the decision to sell, this portfolio was reported at outstanding principal balances, including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees, net of allowances for credit losses. At the time of reclassification of eligible consumer installment receivables to loans and interest receivable, held for sale in May 2023, any previously recorded allowance for credit losses for loans and interest receivable outstanding was reversed, resulting in a decrease in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLoans and interest receivable, held for sale as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 represents installment consumer receivables that we originated and intend to sell to the global investment firm. Loans and interest receivable, held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, determined on an aggregate basis, with valuation changes and any associated charge-offs recorded in restructuring and other on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Interest income on interest bearing held-for-sale loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. \nIf PayPal no longer intends to sell loans and interest receivable, held for sale, such loans would be reclassified to loans and interest receivable, held for investment. When a loan is reclassified to held for investment, any amounts previously recorded in order to measure the loan at the lower of cost or fair value are reversed on our consolidated statements of income (loss) (recognized within restructuring and other) and the loan is recorded consistent with loans held for investment.\nLoans and interest receivable, net\nLoans and interest receivable, net represents consumer loans originated under our revolving credit products (PayPal Credit) and installment credit products and merchant receivables originated under our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) product and PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) product. \n66\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nIn the U.S., consumer interest-bearing installment products, PPWC, and PPBL are provided under a program agreement we have with an independent chartered financial institution (“partner institution”). The partner institution extends credit to consumers for interest-bearing installment products and to merchants for the PPWC and PPBL products, and we purchase the related receivables originated by the partner institution. In the U.S., we extend certain short-term, interest-free, installment loans to consumers through a U.S. subsidiary. For our international consumer credit products, we extend credit in the U.K and the rest of Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and Luxembourg banking subsidiary, respectively, and in Australia and Japan, through local subsidiaries. For our merchant finance products outside the U.S., we extend working capital advances and loans in the U.K. and rest of Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and Luxembourg banking subsidiary, respectively, and working capital loans in Australia through an Australian subsidiary. \nAs part of our arrangement with the partner institution in the U.S., we sell back a participation interest in the pool of receivables for the consumer interest-bearing installment products, PPWC, and PPBL. The partner institution has no recourse against us related to their participation interests for failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation interests held by the partner institution have the same priority to the interests held by us and are subject to the same credit, prepayment, and interest rate risk associated with this pool of receivables. All risks of loss are shared pro rata based on participation interests held among all participating stakeholders. We account for the asset transfer as a sale and derecognize the portion of the participation interests for which control has been surrendered. For this arrangement, gains or losses on the sale of the participation interests are not material as the carrying amount of the participation interest sold approximates the fair value at time of transfer.\nLoans, advances, and interest and fees receivable are reported at their outstanding balances, net of any participation interests sold and unamortized deferred origination costs. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant receivables outstanding and receive a market-based service fee for servicing the assets underlying the participation interest sold. \nWe offer both revolving and installment credit products to our consumers. The terms of our consumer relationships require us to submit monthly bills to the consumer detailing loan repayment requirements. The terms also allow us to charge the consumer interest and fees in certain circumstances. Due to the relatively small dollar amount of individual loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these balances.\nIn certain instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loan or advance and the related interest or fee receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we would be unable to collect all amounts due. \n \nAnother partner institution is the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit consumer financing program in the U.S. We do not hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program and therefore, do not record these receivables on our consolidated financial statements. PayPal earns a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by the partner institution, which is recorded in revenues from other value added services on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\n \nAllowance for loans and interest receivable\nThe allowance for loans and interest receivable represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivables. Changes to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as a component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Changes to the allowance for interest and fees receivable are reflected within revenues from other value added services in net revenues on our consolidated statements of income (loss), or within deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, when interest and fees are billed at the inception of a loan or advance. The evaluation process to assess the adequacy of allowances is subject to numerous estimates and judgments.\n67\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable not classified as held for sale is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data and incorporates macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The consumer loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, loan term, delinquency, credit rating, vintage, and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. For both 2024 and 2023, the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products and installment products (not classified as held for sale) that we have included in our projected loss rates, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, was approximately \n5\n years and \n7\n months to \n3.5\n years, respectively. Projected loss rates (inclusive of historical loss data and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors) are derived based on and applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses, such as expectations of macroeconomic conditions not captured in the loss models for our installment products (not classified as held for sale). The allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors. \nWe charge off consumer receivable balances in the month in which a customer’s balance becomes \n180\n days past the billing date or contractual repayment date, except for the U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment receivables, which are charged off \n120\n days past the contractual repayment date. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable. Loans receivable continue to accrue interest until they are charged off. \nIn connection with the sale of our eligible consumer installment receivables and the reclassification of that portfolio as held for sale in 2023, we reversed the previously recorded allowances for credit losses associated with those loans and interest receivable balances. Charge-offs and any adjustments to the fair value of loans and interest receivable, held for sale, are recorded in restructuring and other on our consolidated statement of income (loss).\nThe allowance for merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. In the third quarter of 2024, we updated our expected credit loss model for our PPWC portfolio to reflect its current risk characteristics. These changes did not have a material impact on our provision recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024. The merchant loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, first borrowing versus repeat borrowing, delinquency, internally developed risk ratings, and vintage, as well as macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment rates and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. The reasonable and supportable forecast period for merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates for 2024 and 2023, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, was approximately \n2.5\n to \n3.5\n years. Projected loss rates, inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors, are derived based on and applied to the principal amount of our merchant receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses. The allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors. \nFor merchant loans and advances, the determination of delinquency is based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPBL product when the repayments are \n180\n days past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product when the repayments are \n180\n days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last \n60\n days, or when the repayments are \n360\n days past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment in the last \n60\n days. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable.\n68\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nCustomer accounts\nWe hold all customer balances, both in the U.S. and internationally, as direct claims against us which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a liability classified as amounts due to customers. Certain jurisdictions where PayPal operates require us to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in these jurisdictions, equal to at least \n100\n% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Therefore, we restrict the use of the assets underlying the customer balances to meet these regulatory requirements and separately classify the assets as customer accounts on our consolidated balance sheets. We classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers. Customer funds for which PayPal is an agent and custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. These funds include U.S. dollar funds which are deposited at one or more third-party financial institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance (subject to applicable limits).\nThe Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) has agreed that PayPal’s management may designate up to \n50\n% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European, U.K., and U.S. credit activities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative amount approved by PayPal to be designated to fund credit activities was $\n2.0\n billion and $\n3.0\n billion, respectively, and represented approximately \n26\n% and \n39\n% of European customer balances made available for our corporate use as of those respective dates, as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. At the time PayPal’s management designates the European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit, the balances are classified as cash and cash equivalents and no longer classified as customer accounts on our consolidated balance sheets. The remaining assets underlying the customer balances remain separately classified as customer accounts on our consolidated balance sheets. We identify these customer accounts separately from corporate funds and maintain them in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities. Customer balances deposited with our partners on a short-term basis in advance of customer transactions and used to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers are classified as cash and cash equivalents within our customer accounts classification on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 8—Cash and Cash Equivalents, Funds Receivable and Customer Accounts, and Investments” for additional information related to customer accounts. \nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are an agent when facilitating cryptocurrency transactions on behalf of our customers. Cryptocurrencies held on behalf of our customers are not PayPal’s assets and therefore, are not reflected as cryptocurrency assets on our consolidated balance sheets; however, we recognize a crypto asset safeguarding liability with a corresponding safeguarding asset to reflect our obligation to safeguard the cryptocurrencies held on behalf of our customers.\nFunds receivable and funds payable\nFunds receivable and funds payable arise due to the time required to initiate collection from and clear transactions through external payment networks. When customers fund their PayPal account using their bank account, credit card, or debit card, or withdraw funds from their PayPal account to their bank account or through a debit card transaction, there is a clearing period before the cash is received or settled, usually \none\n to \nthree\n business days for U.S. transactions and generally up to \nfive\n business days for international transactions. In addition, a portion of our customers’ funds are settled directly to their bank account. These funds are also classified as funds receivable and funds payable and arise due to the time required to initiate collection from and clear transactions through external payment networks. \nWe present changes in funds receivable and funds payable and amounts due to customers as cash flows from investing activities and financing activities, respectively, on our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts.\n \nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment consists primarily of computer equipment, software and website development costs, land and buildings, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets; generally, \none\n to \nfive years\n for computer equipment and software, including capitalized software and website development costs, \nthree years\n for furniture and fixtures, up to \n30\n years for buildings and building improvements, and the shorter of \nfive years\n or the non-cancelable term of the lease for leasehold improvements.\n69\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nDirect costs incurred to develop software for internal use and website development costs, including those costs incurred in expanding and enhancing our payments platform, are capitalized and amortized generally over an estimated useful life of \nthree years\n and are recorded as amortization within the financial statement captions aligned with the internal organizations that are the primary beneficiaries of such assets. We capitalized $\n509\n million and $\n445\n million of internally developed software and website development costs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization expense for these capitalized costs was $\n498\n million, $\n482\n million, and $\n426\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Costs related to the maintenance of internal use software and website development costs are expensed as incurred.\nLeases\nWe determine whether an arrangement is a lease for accounting purposes at contract inception. Operating leases are recorded as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets which are included in \nother assets\n, and lease liabilities which are included in \naccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n and \nother long-term liabilities\n on our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets for finance leases are included in property and equipment, and lease liabilities for finance leases are included in \naccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n and \nother long-term liabilities\n on our consolidated balance sheets. For sale-leaseback transactions, we evaluate the sale and the lease arrangement based on our conclusion as to whether control of the underlying asset has been transferred, and recognize the sale-leaseback as either a sale transaction or under the financing method. The financing method requires the asset to remain on our consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a financing obligation.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. A majority of our leases do not provide an implicit rate and therefore we use an incremental borrowing rate for specific terms on a collateralized basis using information available on the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset calculation includes lease payments to be made and excludes lease incentives. The ROU asset and lease liability may include amounts attributed to options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. When we reach a decision to exercise a lease renewal or termination option, we recognize the associated impact to the ROU asset and lease liability. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for finance leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and interest expense for finance lease liabilities is recognized based on the implicit rate or the incremental borrowing rate. \nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. We have elected to apply the practical expedient and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases, where applicable. In addition, we have elected to apply the practical expedients related to lease classification, hindsight, and land easement. We apply a single portfolio approach to account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nWe evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an ROU asset may not be recoverable. When a decision has been made to exit a lease prior to the contractual term or to sublease that space, we evaluate the asset for impairment and recognize the associated impact to the ROU asset and related expense, if applicable. The evaluation is performed at the asset group level initially and where appropriate, at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual lease level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related ROU assets are estimated over the ROU assets’ useful lives. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the ROU assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related ROU asset or asset group as determined by appropriate valuation techniques.\n \n70\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nGoodwill is tested for impairment, at a minimum, on an annual basis at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the reporting unit may be estimated using income and market approaches. The discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, uses expected future operating results and a market participant discount rate. The market approach uses comparable company prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions (either publicly traded entities or mergers and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results of the reporting unit. Failure to achieve these expected results, changes in the discount rate, or market pricing metrics may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2024 and 2023. We determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill of our reporting unit was required. As of December 31, 2024, we determined that no events occurred, or circumstances changed from August 31, 2024 through December 31, 2024 that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired customer list and user base intangible assets, marketing related intangibles, developed technology, and other intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from \nthree\n to \nseven years\n. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow the asset is expected to generate.\nAllowance for transaction losses\nWe are exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse as well as nonperformance from sellers who accept payments through PayPal. We establish an allowance for estimated losses arising from completing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, purchase protection program claims, and account takeovers. This allowance represents an accumulation of the estimated amounts of probable transaction losses as of the reporting date. The allowance is monitored regularly and is updated based on actual loss data. The allowance is based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types, as appropriate. Additions to the allowance are reflected as a component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). The allowance for transaction losses is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for negative customer balances\nNegative customer balances occur primarily when there are insufficient funds in a customer’s PayPal account to cover charges applied for bank returns and reversals, debit card transactions, and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, which are generally within the scope of our protection programs. Negative customer balances can be cured by the customer by adding funds to their account, receiving payments, or through back-up funding sources. We also utilize third-party collection agencies. For negative customer balances that are not expected to be cured or otherwise collected, we provide an allowance for expected losses. The allowance represents expected losses based on historical trends involving collection and write-off patterns, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, other known facts and circumstances, and reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts, as appropriate. Loss rates are derived using historical loss data for each delinquency bucket using a roll rate model that captures the losses and the likelihood that a negative customer balance will be written off as the delinquency age of such balance increases. The loss rates are then applied to the outstanding negative customer balances. Once the quantitative calculation is performed, we review the adequacy of the allowance and determine if qualitative adjustments need to be considered. We write-off negative customer balances in the month in which the balance becomes outstanding for \n120\n days. Write-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for negative customer balances. Negative customer balances are included in other current assets, net of the allowance on our consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to the allowance for negative customer balances are recorded as a component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\n \n71\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nDerivative instruments\nSee “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” for information related to the derivative instruments.\nRepurchase and reverse repurchase agreements\nWe enter into repurchase agreements as a form of secured borrowing and reverse repurchase agreements as a form of secured lending, primarily to provide additional liquidity and to deploy excess cash. These agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions. Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are reported in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet and recorded at amortized cost.\n \nFair value measurements\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis and certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis when a change in fair value or impairment is evidenced. Fair value is defined as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The categorization within the following three-level fair value hierarchy for our recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements is based upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\n•\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be market-corroborated.\n•\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that cannot be directly corroborated by observable market data and that typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n \nSee “Note 9—Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities” for additional information related to our fair value measurements.\nCrypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset\nSee “Note 7—Other Financial Statement Details” for information related to our crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset.\nConcentrations of risk\nOur cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, loans and interest receivable, net, funds receivable and customer accounts, long-term investments, and other assets, are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash, cash equivalents, and customer accounts are placed with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. In addition, funds receivable are generated primarily with financial institutions which management believes are of high credit quality. We invest our cash, cash equivalents, and customer accounts primarily in highly liquid, highly rated instruments which are uninsured. We have corporate deposit balances with financial services institutions which exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000. As part of our cash management process, we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the U.S. and internationally. Our loans and interest receivable are derived from consumer and merchant financing activities for customers located in the U.S. and internationally. Our long-term notes receivable and contract asset within other assets are associated with the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables to a partner institution. Transaction expense is derived from fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions, located in the U.S. and internationally, when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, one partner institution accounted for \n14\n% and \n15\n% of net accounts receivables, respectively. The same partner institution accounted for our long-term notes receivable and contract asset balance, which represented \n17\n% and \n16\n% of other assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of net loans receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2024, two payment processors accounted for \n48\n% of transaction expense. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, one payment processor accounted for \n60\n% and \n63\n% of transaction expense, respectively. \n72\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nRevenue recognition\nSee “Note 2—Revenue” for information related to our revenue recognition.\nAdvertising expense\nWe expense the cost of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements in the period during which the advertising space or airtime is used as sales and marketing expense. Online advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of the individual agreements, which are generally based on the number of impressions delivered over the total number of contracted impressions, on a pay-per-click basis, or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n Advertising expense totaled $\n574\n million, $\n364\n million, and $\n518\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nDefined contribution savings plans\nWe have a defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”). Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. Expenses related to our defined contribution savings plans are recorded when services are rendered by our employees.\nStock-based compensation\nWe determine compensation expense associated with restricted stock units, performance based restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We determine compensation expense associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generally recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behavior of our employees as well as trends of actual forfeitures.\nForeign currency\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency of their respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using daily exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from these translations are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). Gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are recognized as other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income as a current-period expense when incurred.\n73\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net includes: \n•\ninterest income, which consists of interest earned on corporate cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, \n•\ninterest expense, which consists of interest expense, fees, and amortization of debt discount on our long-term debt (including current portion) and credit facilities, \n•\nrealized and unrealized gains (losses) on strategic investments, and\n•\nother, which primarily includes foreign exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement of certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, forward points on derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, and fair value changes on the derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments.\n \nRecent accounting guidance\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-08,\n Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Crypto Assets\n (Subtopic 350-60): \nAccounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets\n. This amended guidance requires fair value measurement of certain crypto assets each reporting period with the changes in fair value reflected in net income. The amendments also require disclosures of the name, fair value, units held, and cost bases for each significant crypto asset held and annual reconciliations of crypto asset holdings. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2025. We have applied the amendments of this guidance as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact. \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes\n (Topic 740): \nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. The amended guidance enhances income tax disclosures primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance requires disclosure of specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation and further information on reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amended guidance requires disaggregating income taxes paid (net of refunds received) by federal, state, and foreign taxes. It also requires disaggregating individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nIncome Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\n (Subtopic 220-40): \nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n. The amended guidance requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into specified natural expense categories in the disclosures within the notes to the financial statements. In addition, the guidance requires disclosure of selling expenses and its definition. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The guidance can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2025, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 (“SAB 122”) rescinding SAB 121, which required an  entity to record a liability to reflect its obligation to safeguard the crypto assets held for its platform users with a corresponding asset and required disclosures related to the entity’s safeguarding obligations. SAB 122 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and is required to be applied on a fully retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption we will no longer recognize the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset on our consolidated financial statements. \n74\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nRecently adopted accounting guidance\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting \n(Topic 280):\n Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n. The amended guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2024. For additional information, see “Note 18—Segment Information.” \nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these new accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nNOTE 2—\nREVENUE\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into \ntwo\n categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\nTRANSACTION REVENUES\n \nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a fixed and variable component. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. We estimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform, which results in transaction revenue, is referred to as Total Payment Volume (“TPV”). We generate additional revenues from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided. Our contracts generally renew automatically without any significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs.\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using our risk assessment tools, we perform a transaction risk assessment on individual transactions to determine whether a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of completing payments on our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.\n75\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nTo promote engagement and acquire new users on our platform, we may provide incentives to merchants and consumers in various forms including discounts on fees, rebates, rewards, and coupons. Evaluating whether an incentive is a payment to a customer requires judgment. Incentives that are determined to be consideration payable to a customer or paid on behalf of a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue. Incentives based on performance targets are recorded as a reduction to revenue when earned based on management’s estimate of each customer’s future performance, and incentives not based on performance targets are amortized as a reduction of revenue ratably over the contractual term. Certain incentives paid to users that are not our customers are classified as sales and marketing expense.\nWe provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. These protection programs help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss, resulting from, among other things, counterparty non-performance. These protection programs do not provide a separate service to our customers and we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the payment transaction is completed. \nREVENUES FROM\n \nOTHER VALUE ADDED SERVICES\nWe earn revenues from other value added services, which are comprised primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services that we provide to our consumers and merchants. These contracts typically have \none\n performance obligation which is provided and recognized over the term of the contract. The transaction price is generally fixed and known at the end of each reporting period; however, for some agreements, it may be necessary to estimate the transaction price using the expected value method. Revenue earned from other value added services is recorded on a net basis when we are considered the agent with respect to processing transactions.\nWe also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances. Interest and fees earned on the portfolio of loans receivable are computed and recognized based on the effective interest method and are presented net of any required reserves and amortization of deferred origination costs. \nWe record a contract asset when we have a conditional right to consideration for services we have already transferred to our customer.\n These contract assets are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and were $\n207\n million and $\n185\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE\nWe believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar. \nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market and category: \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n  \n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nPrimary geographical markets\nU.S.\n$\n18,267\n \n$\n17,253\n \n$\n15,807\n \nOther countries\n(1)\n13,530\n \n12,518\n \n11,711\n \nTotal net revenues\n(2)\n$\n31,797\n \n$\n29,771\n \n$\n27,518\n \nRevenue category\nTransaction revenues\n$\n28,842\n \n$\n26,857\n \n$\n25,206\n \nRevenues from other value added services\n2,955\n \n2,914\n \n2,312\n \nTotal net revenues\n(2)\n$\n31,797\n \n$\n29,771\n \n$\n27,518\n \n(1)  \nNo single country included in the other countries category generated more than 10% of total net revenues. \n(2) \nTotal net revenues include $\n2.1\n billion, $\n1.8\n billion, and $\n1.3\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which do not represent revenues recognized in the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, \nRevenue from contracts with customers.\n Such revenues relate to \n76\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\ninterest and fees earned on loans and interest receivable, including loans and interest receivable held for sale, as well as hedging gains or losses, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nNet revenues are attributed to the country in which the party paying our fee is located.\nNOTE 3—\nNET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares. During periods when we report net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because the effects of potentially dilutive items would decrease the net loss per share.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated: \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n  \n2022\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss)\n$\n4,147\n \n$\n4,246\n \n$\n2,419\n \nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares of common stock\n—\nbasic\n1,029\n \n1,103\n \n1,154\n \nDilutive effect of equity incentive awards\n10\n \n4\n \n4\n \nWeighted average shares of common stock\n—\ndiluted\n1,039\n \n1,107\n \n1,158\n \nNet income (loss) per share:\nBasic\n$\n4.03\n \n$\n3.85\n \n$\n2.10\n \nDiluted\n$\n3.99\n \n$\n3.84\n \n$\n2.09\n \nCommon stock equivalents excluded from net income (loss) per diluted share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive or potentially dilutive\n9\n \n21\n \n13\n \nNOTE 4—\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nThere were \nno\n acquisitions accounted for as business combinations completed in 2024, 2023, or 2022. There were \nno\n divestitures completed in 2024 or 2022.\nDIVESTITURES COMPLETED IN 2023\nOn November 1, 2023, we completed the sale of Happy Returns to United Parcel Services, Inc. for approximately $\n466\n million in cash, net of cash divested, and derecognized the assets held for sale, consisting primarily of $\n81\n million of goodwill and $\n13\n million of net intangible assets. The sale of Happy Returns enabled us to focus on our core business and priorities. A pre-tax gain of $\n339\n million, net of transaction costs, was included in \nrestructuring and other\n in the consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n \nNOTE 5—\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGOODWILL\nThe following table presents goodwill balances and adjustments to those balances during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nDecember 31, 2022\nGoodwill\nAcquired\nAdjustments\nDecember 31, 2023\nGoodwill\nAcquired\nAdjustments\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n(In millions)\nTotal goodwill\n$\n11,209\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n183\n)\n$\n11,026\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n189\n)\n$\n10,837\n \n77\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe adjustments to goodwill during 2024 pertained to foreign currency translation adjustments.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $\n207\n million, $\n226\n million, and $\n471\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  \nExpected future intangible asset amortization as of December 31, 2024 was as follows:\nFiscal years:\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n144\n \n2026\n88\n \n2027\n53\n \n2028\n41\n \n$\n326\n \nNOTE 6—\nLEASES\nPayPal enters into various leases, which are primarily real estate operating leases. We use these properties for executive and administrative offices, customer services and operations centers, product development offices, and data centers. PayPal also enters into computer equipment finance leases.\nWhile a majority of our lease agreements do not contain an explicit interest rate, certain of our lease agreements are subject to changes based on the Consumer Price Index or another referenced index.

These cryptocurrencies consist of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and PayPal USD stablecoin (collectively,\n \n“our customers’ crypto assets”). We engage third parties, which are licensed trust companies, to provide certain custodial services, including holding our customers’ cryptographic key information, securing our customers’ crypto assets, and protecting them from loss or theft, including indemnification against certain types of losses such as theft. Our third-party custodians hold the crypto assets in a custodial account in PayPal’s name for the benefit of PayPal’s customers. We maintain the internal recordkeeping of our customers’ crypto assets, including the amount and type of crypto asset owned by each of our customers in that custodial account. As of December 31, 2024, we utilize \ntwo\n third-party custodians; as such, there is concentration risk in the event these custodians are not able to perform in accordance with our agreements. \nDue to the unique risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including technological, legal, and regulatory risks, we recognize a crypto asset safeguarding liability to reflect our obligation to safeguard the crypto assets held for the benefit of our customers, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We also recognize a corresponding safeguarding asset which is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted prices for the underlying crypto assets on the active exchange that we have identified as the principal market at the balance sheet date. The corresponding safeguarding asset may be adjusted for loss events, as applicable.\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had not incurred any safeguarding loss events, and therefore, the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset were recorded at the same value. \nThe following table summarizes the significant crypto assets we hold for the benefit of our

Our marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values and are recorded as long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Marketable equity securities totaled $\n23\n million and $\n24\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur non-marketable equity securities are recorded in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities totaled $\n1.5\n billion and $\n1.8\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had non-marketable equity securities of $\n200\n million and $\n182\n million, respectively, for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. We account for these equity securities using the equity method of accounting. The remaining non-marketable equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value and we measure these equity investments at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjust for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, and our share of earnings or losses from investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\nMeasurement Alternative adjustments\nThe adjustments to the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCarrying amount, beginning of period\n$\n1,631\n \n$\n1,687\n \nAdjustments related to non-marketable equity securities:\nNet (sales) additions\n(1)\n(\n2\n)\n67\n \nGross unrealized gains\n20\n \n32\n \nGross unrealized losses and impairments\n(\n313\n)\n(\n155\n)\nCarrying amount, end of period\n$\n1,336\n \n$\n1,631\n \n(1) \nNet (sales) additions include purchases, reductions due to sales of securities, and reclassifications when the Measurement Alternative is subsequently elected or no longer applies.\nThe following table summarizes the cumulative gross unrealized gains and cumulative gross unrealized losses and impairment related to non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative, held at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\n(In millions)\nCumulative gross unrealized gains \n$\n1,187\n \n$\n1,168\n \nCumulative gross unrealized losses and impairments\n$\n(\n562\n)\n$\n(\n283\n)\n89\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nUnrealized gains (losses) on strategic investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method\nThe following table summarizes the net unrealized gains (losses) on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, held at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nNet unrealized gains (losses)\n$\n(\n270\n)\n$\n(\n128\n)\n90\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNOTE 9—\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS\nThe following tables summarize our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:     \nDecember 31, 2024\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for\nIdentical Assets\n(Level 1)\n \nSignificant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)\n(In millions)\nAssets:\n \n \n \nCash and cash equivalents\n(1)\n:\nMoney market fund\n$\n14\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n—\n \nShort-term investments\n(2)\n:\nU.S. government and agency securities\n186\n \n—\n \n186\n \nForeign government and agency securities\n84\n \n—\n \n84\n \nCorporate debt securities\n1,749\n \n—\n \n1,749\n \nMortgage-backed and asset-backed securities\n853\n \n—\n \n853\n \nCommercial paper\n1,282\n \n—\n \n1,282\n \nTotal short-term investments\n4,154\n \n—\n \n4,154\n \nFunds receivable and customer accounts\n(3)\n:\nU.S. government and agency securities\n5,711\n \n—\n \n5,711\n \nForeign government and agency securities\n379\n \n—\n \n379\n \n        Corporate debt securities\n667\n \n—\n \n667\n \nMortgage-backed and asset-backed securities\n4,047\n \n—\n \n4,047\n \nMunicipal securities\n504\n \n—\n \n504\n \nCommercial paper\n3,392\n \n—\n \n3,392\n \nTotal funds receivable and customer accounts\n14,700\n \n—\n \n14,700\n \nDerivatives\n(4)\n243\n \n—\n \n243\n \nCrypto asset safeguarding asset\n(4)\n2,886\n \n—\n \n2,886\n \nLong-term investments\n(2),(5)\n:\nU.S. government and agency securities\n235\n \n—\n \n235\n \nForeign government and agency securities\n123\n \n—\n \n123\n \nCorporate debt securities\n1,602\n \n—\n \n1,602\n \nMortgage-backed and asset-backed securities\n1,042\n \n—\n \n1,042\n \nMarketable equity securities\n23\n \n23\n \n—\n \nTotal long-term investments\n3,025\n \n23\n \n3,002\n \nTotal financial assets\n$\n25,022\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n24,985\n \nLiabilities:\nDerivatives\n(4)\n$\n37\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n37\n \nCrypto asset safeguarding liability\n(4)\n2,886\n \n—\n \n2,886\n \nTotal financial liabilities\n$\n2,923\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,923\n \n(1) \nExcludes cash of $\n6.5\n billion not measured and recorded at fair value.\n(2) \nExcludes restricted cash of $\n1\n million and time deposits of $\n129\n million not measured and recorded at fair value.\n(3) \nExcludes cash, time deposits, and funds receivable of $\n23.0\n billion underlying funds receivable and customer accounts not measured and recorded at fair value.\n(4) \nDerivative assets and liabilities are included within “prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “other assets” and “accrued expenses and other current liabilities” and “other long-term liabilities,” respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.

There are no active markets for our crypto asset safeguarding liability or the corresponding safeguarding asset. Accordingly, we have valued the asset and liability using quoted prices on the active exchange that we have identified as the principal market for the underlying crypto assets (Level 2). All other financial assets and liabilities are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in less active markets, readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, or models using market observable inputs (Level 2). \nA majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple observable inputs where applicable, such as currency rates, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, and equity prices (Level 2). \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any assets or liabilities requiring measurement at fair value on a recurring basis with significant unobservable inputs that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value (Level 3).\nWe elect to account for available-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows us to recognize any gains and losses from fair value changes on such investments in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income (loss) to significantly reduce the accounting asymmetry that would otherwise arise when recognizing the corresponding foreign exchange gains and losses relating to customer liabilities.\n \nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value and amortized cost of our available-for-sale debt securities under the fair value option as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost\nFair Value\nAmortized Cost\nFair Value\n(In millions)\nFunds receivable and customer accounts\n$\n566\n \n$\n564\n \n$\n625\n \n$\n618\n \nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) from fair value changes recognized in other income (expense), net related to the available-for-sale debt securities under the fair value option for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\n:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nFunds receivable and customer accounts\n$\n(\n29\n)\n$\n13\n \nASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS\nThe following tables summarize our assets held as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 for which a non-recurring fair value measurement was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nDecember 31, 2024\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant Other Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\n(In millions)\nLoans and interest receivable, held for sale\n$\n541\n \n$\n541\n \n$\n—\n \nNon-marketable equity securities measured using the Measurement Alternative\n(1)\n476\n \n131\n \n345\n \nTotal\n$\n1,017\n \n$\n672\n \n$\n345\n \n(1) \nExcludes non-marketable equity securities of $\n860\n million accounted for under the Measurement Alternative for which no observable price changes occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n93\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nDecember 31, 2023\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant Other Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\n(In millions)\nLoans and interest receivable, held for sale\n(1)\n$\n563\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n563\n \nNon-marketable equity securities measured using the Measurement Alternative\n(2)\n440\n \n131\n \n309\n \nOther assets\n (3)\n112\n \n112\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n1,115\n \n$\n243\n \n$\n872\n \n(1) \nAs of December 31, 2023, loans and interest receivable, held for sale were valued using a price-based model.

Accordingly, loans and interest receivable, held for sale are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to “Note 11—Loans and Interest Receivable” for additional information on loans and interest receivable, held for sale. \nWe measure the non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable price changes are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value based on valuation methods which only include significant inputs that are observable, such as the observable transaction price at the transaction date. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 when we estimate fair value using significant unobservable inputs such as when we remeasure due to impairment and use discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others. \nWe evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an ROU asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses on ROU lease assets related to office operating leases are calculated using estimated rental income per square foot derived from observable market data, and the impaired asset is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n \nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE\nOur financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, time deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, loans and interest receivable, net, certain customer accounts, notes receivable, and long-term debt related to borrowings on our credit facilities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. Our term debt (including current portion) in the form of fixed rate notes had a carrying value of approximately $\n10.5\n billion and fair value of approximately $\n9.8\n billion as of December 31, 2024. Our term debt (including current portion) in the form of fixed rate notes had a carrying value of approximately $\n10.6\n billion and fair value of approximately $\n10.0\n billion as of December 31, 2023. If these financial instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, cash would be classified as Level 1; restricted cash, time deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, certain customer accounts, and term debt (including current portion) would be classified as Level 2; and the remaining financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nNOTE 10—\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nSUMMARY OF \nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nOur primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that our counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions and by entering into collateral security arrangements. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not use any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n94\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nCash flow hedges\nWe have significant international revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, which subjects us to foreign exchange risk. We have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we designate certain foreign exchange contracts, generally with maturities of \n12\n months or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of these foreign exchange contracts is to help mitigate the risk that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are adversely affected by changes in the applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into revenue or applicable expense line item in the consolidated statements of income (loss) in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the derivative instruments with the critical terms of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item; if the critical terms are the same, we conclude the hedge will be perfectly effective. We do not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We report cash flows arising from derivative instruments consistent with the classification of cash flows from the underlying hedged items that these derivatives are hedging. Accordingly, the cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we estimated that $\n147\n million of net derivative gains related to our cash flow hedges included in AOCI are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur and as such, did not reclassify any gains or losses to earnings prior to the occurrence of the hedged transaction. If we elect to discontinue our cash flow hedges and it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur, we continue to report the derivative’s gain or loss in AOCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which point we also reclassify it into earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives held after we discontinue our cash flow hedges and on derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the same financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. \nNet investment hedges\nWe use forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These derivatives are designated as net investment hedges and accordingly, the gains and losses on the portion of the derivatives included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in AOCI as part of foreign currency translation. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize them in other income (expense), net on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. The accumulated gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings. The cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a net investment hedge are classified in cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. \nWe have \nno\nt reclassified any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings for any of the periods presented. \nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments\nWe have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The gains and losses due to remeasurement of certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts. The cash flows associated with our non-designated derivatives used to hedge foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n95\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nFAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS\nThe fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\n \nBalance Sheet Location\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nDerivative Assets:\n(In millions)\nForeign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments\nOther current assets\n$\n157\n \n$\n7\n \nForeign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments\nOther assets (non-current)\n—\n \n77\n \nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments\nOther current assets\n86\n \n57\n \nTotal derivative assets\n$\n243\n \n$\n141\n \nDerivative Liabilities:\nForeign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments\nOther current liabilities\n$\n10\n \n$\n64\n \nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments\nOther current liabilities\n27\n \n67\n \nTotal derivative liabilities\n$\n37\n \n$\n131\n \nEFFECT OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides the location in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and amount of recognized gains or losses related to our derivative instruments:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nNet revenues\nOther income (expense), net\nNet revenues\nOther income (expense), net\nNet revenues\nOther income (expense), net\nTotal amounts presented in the consolidated statements of income (loss) in which the effects of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded\n$\n31,797\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n29,771\n \n$\n383\n \n$\n27,518\n \n$\n(\n471\n)\nGains (losses) on derivatives in cash flow hedging relationship:\nAmount of net gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts reclassified from AOCI\n48\n \n—\n \n111\n \n—\n \n462\n \n—\n \nGains (losses) on derivatives in net investment hedging relationship:\nAmount of net gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness\n—\n \n67\n \n—\n \n100\n \n—\n \n84\n \nGains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nAmount of net gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts \n—\n \n111\n \n—\n \n(\n263\n)\n—\n \n118\n \nAmount of gains (losses) on equity derivative contracts\n (1)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n44\n \n—\n \n(\n174\n)\nTotal net gains (losses)\n$\n48\n \n$\n178\n \n$\n111\n \n$\n(\n119\n)\n$\n462\n \n$\n28\n \n(1) \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, equity derivative contracts were entered into and matured in association with the sale of marketable equity securities related to strategic investments.

In December 2024, this agreement was amended and restated to extend the commitment period to December 2026 and to increase the maximum balance of loans that can be sold at a time. Loans and interest receivable, held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, determined on an aggregate basis, with valuation changes and any associated charge-offs recorded in restructuring and other on our consolidated statements of income (loss). During the year ended December 31, 2023, we reclassified approximately $\n1.2\n billion of eligible consumer installment receivables from loans and interest receivable, net to loans and interest receivable, held for sale. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, loans and interest receivable, held for sale was $\n541\n million and $\n563\n million, respectively.

Our revolving credit product consists of PayPal Credit in the U.K., which is made available to consumers as a funding source in their PayPal wallet once they are approved for credit. Additionally, we offer installment credit products at the time of checkout in various markets, including the U.S., several markets across Europe, Australia, and Japan. We offer non interest-bearing installment credit products in these markets as well as interest-bearing installment credit products in the U.S. and Germany. We purchase receivables related to interest-bearing installment loans extended to U.S. consumers by a partner institution and are responsible for the servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we purchased approximately $\n690\n million and $\n670\n million in consumer receivables, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the outstanding balance of consumer receivables, which consisted of revolving and installment loans and interest receivable, was $\n5.4\n billion and $\n4.8\n billion, respectively, net of the participation interest sold to the partner institution of $\n23\n million and $\n14\n million, respectively. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information on this participation arrangement.\nWe closely monitor the credit quality of our consumer receivables to evaluate and manage our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins with initial underwriting and continues through the full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators, internally developed risk models using detailed information from external sources, such as credit bureaus where available, and internal data, including the consumer’s prior repayment history with our credit products where available.

The decrease in allowance for credit losses was related to the improvement in credit quality of interest-bearing installment loans in the U.S. offset by the growth of interest-bearing installment loans in the U.S., revolving loans in the U.K., and installment loans in Japan.\nMerchant receivables\nWe offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through our PPWC and PPBL products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S. merchants by a partner institution and are responsible for the servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we purchased approximately $\n1.8\n billion and $\n1.7\n billion in merchant receivables, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable was $\n1.5\n billion and $\n1.2\n billion, respectively, net of the participation interest sold to the partner institution of $\n53\n million and $\n44\n million, respectively. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information on this participation arrangement.\nThrough our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for the loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant’s future payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been satisfied.\nThe interest or fee is fixed at the time the loan or advance is extended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid over the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant’s payment processing history with PayPal. For PPWC, there is a general requirement that at least \n10\n% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every \n90\n days. We calculate the repayment rate of the merchant’s future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within \n9\n to \n12\n months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the contractual term of the loan, which generally ranges from \n3\n to \n12\n months. \n101\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nWe actively monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected or contractual repayment period, as well as the credit quality of our merchant loans and advances that we extend or purchase, so that we can evaluate, quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, risk models developed internally which utilize information obtained from multiple internal and external data sources to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fee. Primary drivers of the models include the merchant’s annual payment volume, payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with PayPal’s credit products where available, information sourced from consumer and business credit bureau reports, and other information obtained during the application process. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making (or, in the U.S., to assist the partner institution in making) ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our internal models, to plan our collection strategies, and in determining our allowance for these loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable. \nMerchant receivables delinquency and allowance\nThe following tables present the delinquency status and gross charge-offs of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable by year of origination.

Interest on these notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022.\nIn May 2020, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $\n4.0\n billion. Interest on these notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020. \nIn September 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $\n5.0\n billion. Interest on these notes is payable on April 1 and October 1. \nThe notes issued from the May 2024, June 2023, May 2022, May 2020, and September 2019 debt issuances are senior unsecured obligations and are collectively referred to as the “Notes.” Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears semiannually. We may redeem the Notes in whole, at any time, or in part (except for the June 2023 notes), from time to time, prior to maturity, at their redemption prices. Upon the occurrence of both a change of control of the Company and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating, we will be required to offer to repurchase each series of Notes at a price equal to \n101\n% of the then outstanding principal amounts, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are subject to covenants, including limitations on our ability to create liens on our assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and merge or consolidate with another entity, in each case subject to certain exceptions, limitations, and qualifications. Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments.\n103\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAs of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of $\n10.6\n billion related to the Notes. \nThe following table summarizes the Notes outstanding:\nAs of December 31,\nMaturities\nEffective Interest Rate\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nSeptember 2019 debt issuance:\nFixed-rate \n2.400\n% notes\n10/1/2024\n2.52\n%\n$\n—\n \n$\n1,250\n \nFixed-rate \n2.650\n% notes\n10/1/2026\n2.78\n%\n1,250\n \n1,250\n \nFixed-rate \n2.850\n% notes\n10/1/2029\n2.96\n%\n1,500\n \n1,500\n \nMay 2020 debt issuance:\nFixed-rate \n1.650\n% notes\n6/1/2025\n1.78\n%\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \nFixed-rate \n2.300\n% notes\n6/1/2030\n2.39\n%\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \nFixed-rate \n3.250\n% notes\n6/1/2050\n3.33\n%\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \nMay 2022 debt issuance:\nFixed-rate \n3.900\n% notes\n6/1/2027\n4.06\n%\n500\n \n500\n \nFixed-rate \n4.400\n% notes\n6/1/2032\n4.53\n%\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \nFixed-rate \n5.050\n% notes\n6/1/2052\n5.14\n%\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \nFixed-rate \n5.250\n% notes\n6/1/2062\n5.34\n%\n500\n \n500\n \nJune 2023 debt issuance\n(1)\n:\n¥\n30\n billion fixed-rate \n0.813\n% notes\n6/9/2025\n0.89\n%\n191\n \n213\n \n¥\n23\n billion fixed-rate \n0.972\n% notes\n6/9/2026\n1.06\n%\n147\n \n163\n \n¥\n37\n billion fixed-rate \n1.240\n% notes\n6/9/2028\n1.31\n%\n236\n \n262\n \nMay 2024 debt issuance:\nFixed-rate \n5.150\n% notes\n6/1/2034\n5.35\n%\n850\n \n—\n \nFixed-rate \n5.500\n% notes\n6/1/2054\n5.66\n%\n400\n \n—\n \nTotal term debt\n$\n10,574\n \n$\n10,638\n \nUnamortized premium (discount) and issuance costs, net\n(\n78\n)\n(\n68\n)\nLess: current portion of term debt\n(2)\n(\n1,191\n)\n(\n1,249\n)\nTotal carrying amount of term debt\n$\n9,305\n \n$\n9,321\n \n(1)  \nPrincipal amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2)  \nThe current portion of term debt is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe effective interest rates for the Notes include interest on the Notes, amortization of debt issuance costs, and amortization of the debt discount.

The Credit Agreement includes a $\n150\n million letter of credit sub-facility and a $\n600\n million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. Loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement are available in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, and Australian dollar, and in each case subject to the sub-limits and other limitations provided in the Credit Agreement. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders and satisfaction of specified conditions, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $\n2.0\n billion. Subject to specific conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the Credit Agreement, provided PayPal Holdings, Inc. guarantees the portion of borrowings made available and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, certain subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other purposes not in contravention of the Credit Agreement. \nWe are obligated to pay interest on loans under the Credit Agreement and other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) the applicable term benchmark rate plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from \n0.750\n% to \n1.250\n%, (ii) the applicable Risk-Free Rate (Sterling Overnight Index Average for loans denominated in pounds sterling and Euro Short-Term Rate for loans denominated in euros) rate plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from \n0.750\n% to \n1.250\n%, (iii) the applicable overnight rate plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from \n0.750\n% to \n1.250\n% or (iv) a formula based on the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate or the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from \nzero\n to \n0.250\n%. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, the Company and any subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on June 7, 2028, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at the request of the Company or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon the request of the Company, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant requires the Company to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nno\n borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2024, $\n5.0\n billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\nPaidy credit agreement\nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Paidy Credit Agreement”) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility of ¥\n60.0\n billion, which was modified in September 2022, to increase the borrowing capacity by ¥\n30.0\n billion for a total borrowing capacity of ¥\n90.0\n billion (approximately $\n574\n million as of December 31, 2024). Borrowings under the Paidy Credit Agreement are for use by Paidy for working capital, capital expenditures, and other permitted purposes. Loans under the Paidy Credit Agreement bear interest at the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (based on our public debt rating) ranging from \n0.40\n% to \n0.60\n%. The Paidy Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed thereunder will be due and payable in February 2027, unless the commitments are terminated earlier. The Paidy Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant requires us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\n105\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, ¥\n90.0\n billion (approximately $\n574\n million) and ¥\n50.0\n billion (approximately $\n355\n million) was drawn down under the Paidy Credit Agreement, respectively, which was recorded in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024, \nno\n borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement.

The weighted average interest rate on the borrowing was \n7.92\n% as of December 31, 2023. We repaid $\n400\n million of borrowings due to bank overdrafts during the year ended December 31, 2024. The total interest expense and fees we recorded related to the borrowings were de minimis.\nWe also maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, which had a borrowing capacity of approximately $\n80\n million in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. This available credit includes facilities where we can withdraw and utilize the funds at our discretion for general corporate purposes. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2024, substantially all of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.\nFUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2024, the future principal payments associated with our term debt were as follows (in millions):\n2025\n$\n1,191\n \n2026\n1,397\n \n2027\n500\n \n2028\n236\n \n2029\n1,500\n \nThereafter\n5,750\n \nTotal\n$\n10,574\n \n NOTE 13—\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nOverview\nWe are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Certain of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount of damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements at that time. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of such non-monetary remedies.\n106\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAmounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable and reasonably estimable were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024. Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 13, we have concluded, based on currently available information, that reasonably possible losses arising directly from the proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRegulatory proceedings\nPayPal Australia Pty Limited (“PPAU”) self-reported a potential violation to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (“AUSTRAC”) on May 22, 2019. This self-reported matter relates to PPAU incorrectly filing required international funds transfer instructions over a period of time under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (“AML/CTF Act”). On September 23, 2019, PPAU received a notice from AUSTRAC requiring that PPAU appoint an external auditor (a partner of a firm which is not our independent auditor) to review certain aspects of PPAU’s compliance with its obligations under the AML/CTF Act. The external auditor was appointed on November 1, 2019.\nAUSTRAC had notified PPAU that its enforcement team was investigating the matters reported upon by the external auditor in its August 31, 2020 final report. As a resolution of this investigation, on March 17, 2023, AUSTRAC’s Chief Executive Officer accepted an enforceable undertaking from PPAU in relation to the self-reported issues.\nThe enforceable undertaking does not include a monetary penalty. The entry into and compliance with the enforceable undertaking will not require a change to our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nPPAU is required to deliver an Assurance Action Plan (“AAP”) under the enforceable undertaking to demonstrate that the governance and oversight arrangements following the remedial work completed by PPAU are sustainable and appropriate. The enforceable undertaking requires PPAU to appoint an external auditor. The external auditor was appointed on June 22, 2023 to assess and report on the appropriateness, sustainability and efficacy of the actions to be taken under the AAP. PPAU provided the external auditor’s final report to AUSTRAC on April 16, 2024. The successful completion of the enforceable undertaking is subject to AUSTRAC’s ultimate review and decision based on the external auditor’s final report. We cannot predict the outcome of AUSTRAC’s decision. Any failure to comply with the enforceable undertaking could result in penalties or require us to change our business practices.\nIn February 2022, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) related to PayPal’s practices relating to commercial customers that submit charges on behalf of other merchants or sellers, and related activities. The CID requests the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are cooperating with the FTC in connection with this CID.\nIn January 2023, we received notice of an administrative proceeding and a related request for information from the German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”) related to terms in PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A.’s contractual terms with merchants in Germany prohibiting surcharging and requiring parity presentation of PayPal relative to other payment methods. We are cooperating with the FCO in connection with this proceeding.\nWe have received CIDs from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) related to investigation and error-resolution obligations under Regulation E, the presentment of transactions to linked bank accounts, and related matters. The CIDs request the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are cooperating with the CFPB in connection with these CIDs.\nIn November 2023, we received a subpoena from the U.S. SEC Division of Enforcement relating to PayPal USD stablecoin. The subpoena requests the production of documents. We are cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request.\n107\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nIn August 2024, we received a CID from the CFPB related to PayPal Credit. The CID also relates to backup payment options in a digital wallet to pay for goods or services. The CID requests the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are cooperating with the CFPB in connection with this CID.\nLegal proceedings\nOn October 4, 2022, a putative securities class action captioned \nDefined Benefit Plan of the Mid-Jersey Trucking Industry and Teamsters Local 701 Pension and Annuity Fund v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al.\n, Case No. 22-cv-5864, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. On January 11, 2023, the Court appointed Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec as lead plaintiff and renamed the action \nIn re PayPal Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation\n (“PPH Securities Action”). On March 13, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed an amended and consolidated complaint. The PPH Securities Action asserts claims relating to our public statements with respect to net new active accounts (“NNA”) results and guidance, and the detection of illegitimately created accounts. The PPH Securities Action purports to be brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s stock between February 3, 2021 and February 1, 2022 (the “Class Period”), and asserts claims for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act against the Company, as well as its former Chief Executive Officer, former Chief Strategy, Growth and Data Officer, and former Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the “Individual Defendants,” and together with the Company, “Defendants”), and for alleged violations of Sections 20(a) and 20A of the Exchange Act against the Individual Defendants. The complaint alleges that certain public statements made by Defendants during the Class Period were rendered materially false and misleading (which, allegedly, caused the Company’s stock to trade at artificially inflated prices) by the Defendants’ failure to disclose that, among other things, the Company’s incentive campaigns were susceptible to fraud and led to the creation of illegitimate accounts, which allegedly affected the Company’s NNA results and guidance. The PPH Securities Action seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of the putative class members. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the PPH Securities Action. On January 29, 2025, the Court dismissed all of the claims without prejudice. The lead plaintiff has until March 17, 2025 to file an amended complaint.\nOn November 2, 2022, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned \nShah v. Daniel Schulman, et al.\n, Case No. 22-cv-1445, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the “Shah Action”), purportedly on behalf of the Company. On April 4, 2023, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned \nNelson v. Daniel Schulman, et. al.\n, Case No. 23-cv-01913, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the “Nelson Action”) purportedly on behalf of the Company. On January 31, 2025, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned \nSpathias v. Daniel Schulman, et al.\n, Case No. 25-cv-1007, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Spathias Action,” and collectively, the “Derivative Actions”). The Derivative Actions are based on the same alleged facts and circumstances as the PPH Securities Action, and name certain of our officers, including our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer, and members of our Board of Directors, as defendants. The Derivative Actions allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, gross mismanagement and violations of the Exchange Act, and seek to recover damages on behalf of the Company. The Shah and Nelson Actions have been stayed pending further developments in the PPH Securities Action.\nOn December 20, 2022, a civil lawsuit captioned \nState of Hawai‘i, by its Office of Consumer Protection, v. PayPal, Inc., and PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n, Case No. 1CCV-22-0001610, was filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit of the State of Hawai‘i (the “Hawai‘i Action”). The Hawai‘i Action asserts claims for unfair and deceptive acts and practices under Hawai‘i Revised Statutes Sections 480-2(a) and 481A-3(a). Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief as well as unspecified penalties and other monetary relief. On July 14, 2023, the court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. Trial is scheduled to begin in October 2025.\n108\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nGeneral matters\nOther third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are subject to patent disputes and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business as our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against our companies and/or against our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a result of our acquisitions, particularly in cases where we are introducing new products or services in connection with such acquisitions. We have in the past been forced to litigate such claims, and we believe that additional lawsuits alleging such claims will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business, or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or make substantial payments to settle claims or to satisfy damages awarded by courts.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our consumers (individually or as class actions), merchants or regulators alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules, or policies, that our practices, prices, rules, policies, or user, product, business or merchant agreements violate applicable law, or that we have acted unfairly or not acted in conformity with such prices, rules, policies, or agreements. In addition to these types of disputes and regulatory inquiries, our operations are also subject to regulatory and legal review and challenges that may reflect the increasing global regulatory focus to which the payments industry is subject and, when taken together with other regulatory and legislative action, such actions could result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on our business and customers and may lead to increased costs and decreased transaction volume and revenue. Further, the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business has grown and expanded in scale and scope, including the number of active accounts and payments transactions on our platform, the range and increasing complexity of the products and services that we offer, and our geographical operations. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, settlement payments, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), fines, penalties, injunctive relief, or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our products, services or business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business.\nINDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS\nOur agreements with eBay governing our separation from eBay provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations for both eBay and us. Disputes between eBay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future, and an adverse outcome in such matters could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against eBay under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us, and our indemnity obligations to eBay may be significant.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos, and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are related to the subject agreement. These indemnification provisions generally include indemnity for other types of third-party claims, which may be related to intellectual property rights, confidentiality, willful misconduct, data privacy obligations, and certain breach of contract claims, among others. These indemnification provisions generally also include indemnity to our payments processors in the event of card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by us or our customers. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation. \nPayPal has participated in the U.S. Government’s Paycheck Protection Program administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Loans made under this program were funded by an independent chartered financial institution that we partnered with. We received a fee for providing services in connection with these loans and retained operational and audit risk related to those activities. We have agreed, under certain circumstances, to indemnify the chartered financial institution and its assignee of a portion of these loans in connection with the services provided for loans made under this program.\n109\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAs part of the agreement to sell a portion of our consumer installment receivables portfolio, in certain circumstances such as breaches in loan warranties, we may be required to indemnify the global investment firm that purchased the loans or repurchase the loans. The estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments we may be required to make is equal to the current outstanding balances of the loans sold; however, the maximum potential amount of the indemnification is not, in our view, representative of the expected future exposure. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the current outstanding balances of the loans sold was $\n2.9\n billion and $\n2.2\n billion, respectively. The terms of the indemnification align to the maturities of the loans sold.\n \nTo date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nPROTECTION PROGRAMS\nIn addition to the protections afforded by applicable law, we provide consumers and merchants with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. Our protection programs help protect both consumers and merchants from financial loss resulting from, among other things, counterparty non-performance. These programs are designed to promote confidence on the part of both consumers, who will be reimbursed in certain circumstances, such as not receiving their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, as well as merchants, who will receive payment in certain circumstances, such as establishing proof of shipment or delivery of an item to the customer. These protection programs are considered assurance-type warranties under applicable accounting standards for which we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the payment transaction is completed.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for transaction losses was $\n86\n million and $\n64\n million, respectively. The allowance for negative customer balances was $\n256\n million and $\n218\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe following table shows changes in the allowance for transaction losses and negative customer balances related to our\n \nprotection programs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023: \nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nBeginning balance\n$\n282\n \n$\n278\n \nProvision\n1,114\n \n1,192\n \nRealized losses\n(\n1,218\n)\n(\n1,313\n)\nRecoveries\n164\n \n125\n \nEnding balance\n$\n342\n \n$\n282\n \n \n110\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNOTE 14—\nSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\nIn July 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to $\n10.0\n billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. In June 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $\n15.0\n billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This program became effective in the first quarter of 2023 upon completion of the July 2018 stock repurchase program. In February 2025, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $\n15.0\n billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. Our stock repurchase programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. We may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any time without prior notice. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately \n92\n million shares of our common stock for approximately $\n6.0\n billion at an average cost of $\n65.55\n, excluding excise tax. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in June 2022. As of December 31, 2024, a total of approximately $\n4.9\n billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program.  \nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we have reflected the applicable excise tax in treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $\n50\n million and $\n44\n million in excise tax within treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. The payable associated with the excise tax is a non-cash financing activity which is not reflected on the consolidated statement of cash flows until settled.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately \n74\n million shares of our common stock for approximately $\n5.0\n billion at an average cost of $\n67.72\n, excluding excise tax. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase programs authorized in July 2018 and June 2022. As of December 31, 2023, a total of approximately $\n10.9\n billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program.  \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately \n41\n million shares of our common stock for approximately $\n4.2\n billion at an average cost of $\n103.47\n. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in July 2018. As of December 31, 2022, a total of approximately $\n861\n million and $\n15.0\n billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2018 and June 2022 stock repurchase programs, respectively.\nShares of common stock repurchased for the periods presented were recorded as treasury stock for the purposes of calculating net income (loss) per share and were accounted for under the cost method. \nNo\n repurchased shares of common stock have been retired.\nNOTE 15—\nSTOCK-BASED AND EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\nEQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN\nUnder the terms of the Amended and Restated PayPal Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the “Plan”), equity awards, including restricted stock units (“RSUs”), restricted stock awards, performance based restricted stock units (“PBRSUs”), stock options, deferred stock units, and stock payments, may be granted to our directors, officers, and employees. \nIn May 2024, our stockholders approved the authorization of an additional \n20\n million shares to the Plan. At December 31, 2024, approximately \n76\n million shares were authorized under the Plan and approximately \n46\n million shares were available for future grant. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises and the release of stock awards were funded primarily with the issuance of new shares of common stock.\n111\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nRSUs are granted to eligible employees under the Plan. RSUs issued prior to January 1, 2022 generally vest in equal annual installments over a period of \nthree years\n. RSUs issued on or after January 1, 2022 generally vest over \nthree years\n at a rate of \n33\n% after \none year\n, then in equal quarterly installments thereafter. RSUs are subject to an employee’s continuing service to us, and do not have an expiration date. The cost of RSUs granted is determined using the fair market value of PayPal’s common stock on the date of grant.\nCertain of our executives and non-executives are eligible to receive PBRSUs, which are equity awards that may be earned based upon the Company’s performance relative to pre-established market or performance targets over performance periods of \none\n to \nthree years\n. We estimate the fair value of market-based PBRSU awards at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition might not be satisfied. The total estimated fair value is amortized over each award’s performance period regardless of whether the condition is satisfied. The number of shares that vest at the end of each performance period will vary based on the performance against specified market conditions. PBRSUs that are subject to a performance condition may vest and settle depending on the Company’s performance against pre-established performance metrics over a predefined performance period. PBRSUs with only a performance condition generally are  cliff vested following the completion of the performance period, subject to the Compensation Committee’s approval of the level of achievement against the pre-established performance targets. Over the performance period, the number of PBRSUs with only a performance condition that may be issued, and related stock-based compensation expense that is recognized, is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achieving the approved performance targets. Depending on the probability of achieving the pre-established performance targets, the number of PBRSUs with only a performance condition issued could range from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the target amount. \nAll stock options under the Plan were assumed in connection with acquisitions on the same terms and conditions (including vesting) applicable to such acquired companies’ equity awards. The cost of stock options was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. \nEMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN\nUnder the terms of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), shares of our common stock may be purchased over an offering period with a maximum duration of \ntwo years\n at \n85\n% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the applicable offering period or on the last business day of each \nsix-month\n purchase period within the offering period. Employees may contribute between \n2\n% and \n10\n% of their gross compensation during an offering period to purchase shares, but not more than the statutory limitation of $25,000 per year. All company stock purchased through the ESPP is considered outstanding and is included in the weighted-average outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted net income (loss) per share. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our employees purchased \n2.1\n million, \n2.3\n million, and \n1.9\n million shares under the ESPP at an average per share price of $\n44.16\n, $\n55.34\n, and $\n73.20\n, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, approximately \n42\n million shares were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.\n112\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nRSU, PBRSU, AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY\nThe following table summarizes RSU, PBRSU, and restricted stock activity under the Plan as of December 31, 2024 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2024:\nUnits\nWeighted Average Grant-Date\nFair Value\n(per share)\n \n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024\n30,164\n \n$\n88.10\n \nAwarded\n \nand assumed\n(1)\n24,138\n \n$\n63.49\n \nVested\n(1)\n(\n16,654\n)\n$\n92.40\n \nForfeited/cancelled\n(\n6,360\n)\n$\n85.96\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n31,288\n \n$\n67.35\n \nExpected to vest\n26,244\n \n(1) \nIncludes approximately \n1.1\n million of additional PBRSUs issued during 2024 due to the achievement of company performance metrics on awards granted in previous years.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs and PBRSUs vested under the Plan was $\n1.1\n billion, $\n752\n million, and $\n935\n million, respectively. \nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company granted \n1.9\n million PBRSUs with a \nthree-year\n performance period. In the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company granted \n2.3\n million PBRSUs with a \none-year\n performance period (fiscal 2023), which became fully vested following the completion of the performance period in February 2024 (\none year\n from the annual incentive award cycle grant date), and \n1.8\n million PBRSUs with a \nthree-year\n performance period.\nSTOCK OPTION ACTIVITY\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity of our employees under the Plan for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nShares\n(1)\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm (Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic Value\n \n(In thousands, except per share amounts and years)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024\n72\n \n$\n15.18\n \nExercised\n(\n34\n)\n$\n16.50\n \nForfeited/expired/cancelled\n(\n2\n)\n$\n11.19\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n36\n \n$\n14.08\n \n2.92\n$\n2,660\n \nExpected to vest\n—\n \n$\n114.09\n \n6.28\n$\n1\n \nOptions exercisable\n36\n \n$\n13.90\n \n2.92\n$\n2,659\n \n(1) \n“—” Denotes shares of less than a thousand.\nNo\n options were granted or assumed during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the Plan was $\n2\n million, $\n4\n million, and $\n16\n million, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. At December 31, 2024, substantially all outstanding options were in-the-money. \nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nStock-based compensation expense for \nthe Plan\n is measured based on their estimated fair value at the time of grant, and recognized over the award’s vesting period.\n113\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nT\nhe impact on our results of operations of recording stock-based compensation expense under the Plan for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nCustomer support and operations\n$\n233\n \n$\n305\n \n$\n269\n \nSales and marketing\n143\n \n179\n \n151\n \nTechnology and development\n478\n \n612\n \n512\n \nGeneral and administrative\n339\n \n434\n \n383\n \nRestructuring and other\n100\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$\n1,293\n \n$\n1,530\n \n$\n1,315\n \nCapitalized as part of internal use software and website development costs\n$\n109\n \n$\n52\n \n$\n52\n \nIncome tax benefit on total stock-based compensation expense\n$\n238\n \n$\n260\n \n$\n209\n \nIncome tax benefit realized related to awards vested or exercised\n$\n205\n \n$\n136\n \n$\n182\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, there was approximately $\n1.3\n billion of unearned stock-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.83\n years.

Future unearned stock-based compensation will increase to the extent we grant additional equity awards, change the mix of equity awards we grant, or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions. \nEMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\nUnder the terms of the PayPal Holdings, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, which also qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Code, participating U.S. employees may contribute up to \n50\n% of their eligible compensation, but not more than statutory limits. Under the PayPal plan, eligible employees received one dollar for each dollar contributed, up to \n4\n% of each employee’s eligible salary, subject to a maximum employer contribution per employee of $\n13,800\n in 2024, $\n13,200\n in 2023, and $\n12,200\n in 2022. Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the matching contribution expense for our U.S. and international savings plans was approximately $\n74\n million, $\n80\n million, and $\n83\n million, respectively.\nNOTE 16—\nINCOME TAXES\nThe components of income before income taxes were as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nUnited States\n$\n946\n \n$\n993\n \n$\n(\n155\n)\nInternational\n4,383\n \n4,418\n \n3,521\n \nIncome before income taxes\n$\n5,329\n \n$\n5,411\n \n$\n3,366\n \n114\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe income tax expense was composed of the following:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n342\n \n$\n1,031\n \n$\n688\n \nState and local\n107\n \n145\n \n104\n \nForeign\n502\n \n657\n \n966\n \nTotal current portion of income tax expense (benefit)\n$\n951\n \n$\n1,833\n \n$\n1,758\n \nDeferred:\nFederal\n$\n278\n \n$\n(\n490\n)\n$\n(\n563\n)\nState and local\n(\n29\n)\n(\n79\n)\n(\n101\n)\nForeign\n(\n18\n)\n(\n99\n)\n(\n147\n)\nTotal deferred portion of income tax expense (benefit)\n231\n \n(\n668\n)\n(\n811\n)\nIncome tax expense\n$\n1,182\n \n$\n1,165\n \n$\n947\n \nThe following is a reconciliation of the difference between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nFederal statutory rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nDomestic income taxed at different rates\n0.1\n \n%\n(\n1.5\n)\n%\n(\n0.6\n)\n%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\n1.1\n \n%\n1.1\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nForeign income taxed at different rates\n(\n4.3\n)\n%\n(\n5.1\n)\n%\n(\n12.2\n)\n%\nStock-based compensation expense\n2.6\n \n%\n3.5\n \n%\n4.1\n \n%\nTax credits\n0.6\n \n%\n(\n0.7\n)\n%\n(\n0.4\n)\n%\nChange in valuation allowances\n0.6\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n2.2\n \n%\nIntra-group transfer of intellectual property\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\nOther\n0.5\n \n%\n3.2\n \n%\n4.0\n \n%\nEffective income tax rate\n22.2\n \n%\n21.5\n \n%\n28.1\n \n%\n115\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. \nSignificant deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:\n \nAs of December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss and credit carryforwards\n$\n265\n \n$\n305\n \nAccruals and allowances\n546\n \n761\n \nLease liabilities\n194\n \n138\n \nStock-based compensation\n93\n \n168\n \nNet unrealized losses\n1\n \n36\n \nSafeguarded crypto liabilities\n743\n \n319\n \nCapitalized research and development\n1,077\n \n1,207\n \nOther items\n89\n \n114\n \nTotal deferred tax assets\n3,008\n \n3,048\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n240\n)\n(\n276\n)\nNet deferred tax assets\n$\n2,768\n \n$\n2,772\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nROU lease assets\n$\n(\n153\n)\n$\n(\n96\n)\nCapitalized software development costs\n(\n176\n)\n(\n187\n)\nNet unrealized gains\n(\n97\n)\n(\n170\n)\nSafeguarded crypto assets\n(\n743\n)\n(\n319\n)\nOther items\n(\n101\n)\n(\n161\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(\n1,270\n)\n(\n933\n)\nNet deferred tax assets \n$\n1,498\n \n$\n1,839\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $\n733\n million, and certain of these amounts are subject to an annual limitation. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2025. It is more likely than not that most of these net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance against them. As of December 31, 2024, our California research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $\n270\n million, which may be carried forward indefinitely.\nRepatriation of our foreign earnings for use in the U.S. is generally not expected to result in a significant amount of income taxes; as a result, the corresponding deferred tax liability we have accrued is not material.\nWe benefit from agreements concluded in certain jurisdictions, most significantly Singapore. The Singapore agreement is effective through 2030, results in significantly lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and requires various thresholds of investment and employment in that jurisdiction. We review our compliance on an annual basis to ensure we continue to meet our obligations under this agreement. This agreement resulted in tax savings of approximately $\n473\n million, $\n441\n million, and $\n510\n million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Excluding the effect of U.S. and foreign tax legislation the benefit of this agreement on our net income (loss) per share (diluted) was approximately $\n0.46\n, $\n0.40\n, and $\n0.44\n in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. These results may further vary based on our overall tax profile. \nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has published model rules, which include the implementation of a global minimum tax rate of 15%, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. Certain countries in which we do business have enacted implementing legislation effective January 1, 2024. Based on the Company’s analysis of such enacted legislation for jurisdictions in which we operate, there was not a material impact to the Company’s 2024 income tax provision. \n116\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table reflects changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented below:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nGross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of the beginning of the period\n$\n2,236\n \n$\n1,877\n \n$\n1,678\n \nIncreases related to prior period tax positions\n44\n \n178\n \n52\n \nDecreases related to prior period tax positions\n(\n201\n)\n(\n30\n)\n(\n185\n)\nIncreases related to current period tax positions\n280\n \n235\n \n337\n \nSettlements\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\nStatute of limitation expirations\n(\n39\n)\n(\n24\n)\n(\n3\n)\nGross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of the period\n$\n2,320\n \n$\n2,236\n \n$\n1,877\n \nIf the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $\n1.5\n billion. \n \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized net interest and penalties of $\n50\n million, $\n151\n million, and $\n119\n million, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. This expense is reflected in the “Other” line of our effective income tax rate schedule. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $\n556\n million and $\n520\n million, respectively.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by certain tax authorities for the 2013 to 2023 tax years. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to examination by tax authorities for tax years after 2012 primarily include the U.S. (Federal and California), India, Israel, and Singapore. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from our open examinations. \nDue to various factors, including uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of these unrecognized tax benefits is highly uncertain. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months, we may receive additional tax adjustments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of audits in one or more jurisdictions. These adjustments or settlements could result in changes to our unrecognized tax benefits related to positions on prior year tax filings. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we were unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn connection with our separation from eBay in 2015, we entered into various agreements that govern the relationship between the parties going forward, including a tax matters agreement. Under the tax matters agreement, eBay is generally responsible for all additional taxes (and will be entitled to all related refunds of taxes) imposed on eBay and its subsidiaries (including subsidiaries that were transferred to PayPal pursuant to the separation) arising after the separation date with respect to the taxable periods (or portions thereof) ended on or prior to July 17, 2015, except for those taxes for which PayPal has reflected an unrecognized tax benefit in its financial statements on the separation date.\n117\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNOTE 17—\nRESTRUCTURING AND OTHER\nRESTRUCTURING\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to streamline operations, focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our cost structure. The associated \nrestructuring charges\n during the year ended December 31, 2024 were $\n307\n million, and included employee severance and benefits costs and stock-based compensation expense, all of which were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the restructuring reserve activity during the year ended December 31, 2024:\n \nEmployee Severance and  Benefits Costs\n(In millions)\nAccrued liability as of January 1, 2024\n$\n—\n \nCharges\n(1)\n207\n \nPayments\n(\n196\n)\nAccrued liability as of December 31, 2024\n$\n11\n \n(1) \nExcludes stock-based compensation expense of $\n100\n million.\n(2) \nAccrued restructuring liability is included in “accrued expenses and other current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities and improve our cost structure and operating efficiency. The associated restructuring charges in 2023 were $\n122\n million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, which were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2023.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, management initiated a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce intended to streamline and optimize our global operations to enhance operating efficiency. This effort focused on reducing redundant operations and simplifying our organizational structure. The associated restructuring charges in 2022 were $\n121\n million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, as well as associated consulting costs under this strategic reduction. The strategic actions associated with this plan were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2022.\nWe continue to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset impairment charges of \nnil\n in 2024 and $\n61\n million and $\n81\n million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, due to exiting certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of ROU lease assets and related leasehold improvements. Additionally, we recognized a gain of $\n17\n million due to the sale of an owned property and incurred a loss of $\n14\n million related to another owned property held for sale in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOTHER\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $\n129\n million and $\n74\n million, respectively, of losses were recorded in restructuring and other, which included net loss on sale of loans and interest receivable previously held for sale (inclusive of transactions costs) and fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest receivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of Happy Returns and recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n339\n million, net of transaction costs, in restructuring and other.
