Increased results were driven primarily by the implementation of new rates in the Regulated Businesses from capital and acquisition investments. Results also reflect increased production and employee-related costs, increased depreciation and higher financing costs used to fund the current capital investment plan. Results for 2024 and 2023 reflect the net favorable impact of warmer, drier weather compared to normal, estimated at $0.12 per share, and $0.13 per share, respectively. Results for 2024 include incremental interest income of $0.09 per share, resulting from the early 2024 amendment to the secured seller note from the sale of the former HOS business. \nGrowth Through Capital Investment in Infrastructure and Regulated Acquisitions\nThe Company continues to grow its businesses, with the substantial majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses through (i) continued capital investment in the Company’s infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, (ii) regulated acquisitions to expand the Company’s services to new customers and (iii) organic growth in existing systems. In 2024,\n \nthe Company invested $3.3 billion, in the Regulated Businesses, as discussed below:\n•\n$2.8 billion capital investment in the Regulated Businesses, for infrastructure improvements and replacements; and\n•\n$417 million to fund acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, which added approximately 69,500 customers during 2024. This includes the acquisitions by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary of the wastewater collection and treatment system assets from the Butler Area Sewer Authority on October 29, 2024, for a cash purchase price of $230 million, which added approximately 15,000 customer connections, and by the Company’s Illinois subsidiary of a wastewater treatment plant and related assets from Granite City on March 11, 2024, for a cash purchase price of $86 million, which added approximately 26,000 wastewater customers, including 15,500 customers indirectly in surrounding communities.\n•\nApproximately 19,400 new customers were added through organic growth in existing systems.\nThe Company expects to invest between $17 billion to $18 billion over the next five years, and between $40 billion to $42 billion over the next 10 years, including $3.3 billion in 2025. The Company’s expected future investments include:\n•\ncapital investment for infrastructure improvements and replacements in the Regulated Businesses of between $15.5 billion to $16 billion over the next five years, and between $36 billion to $37 billion over the next 10 years; and\n•\ngrowth from acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses to expand the Company’s water and wastewater customer base of between $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next five years, and between $4 billion to $5 billion over the next 10 years.\nThe Company estimates the expected capital investment for infrastructure improvements in its Regulated Businesses over the next ten years will be allocated to the following purposes: infrastructure renewal 68%; resiliency 10%; water quality, including capital expenditures related to PFAS 8%; operational efficiency, technology and innovation 6%; system expansion 5%; other 3%.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had entered into 17 agreements with a total aggregate purchase price of $105 million for pending acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses to add approximately 24,200 additional customers.\nIn December 2020, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement (an acquisition intended to comply with Act 12 (discussed below)) to acquire the wastewater collection system assets of Brentwood Borough (“Brentwood”) for a purchase price of approximately $19 million. On February 22, 2024, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the “PaPUC”) denied the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s application to acquire Brentwood. On April 3, 2024, the Pennsylvania subsidiary filed an appeal of the decision with the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, asserting, among other things, the PaPUC did not apply the correct legal standard in its decision. The Company cannot currently predict the outcome of this appeal, and the matter remains pending.\nOn July 2, 2024, the PaPUC issued the Final Supplemental Implementation Order (“FSIO”), which makes certain changes to the process by which the PaPUC considers and decides applications to acquire water and wastewater assets under Pennsylvania’s existing utility valuation law, known as Act 12 of 2016 (“Act 12”). The FSIO includes, among other things, a reasonableness review ratio that would be applied to help guide the determination on the overall prudency of the transaction and reasonableness of the purchase price. The provisions of the FSIO are not retroactive and apply to acquisition applications filed after July 2, 2024. The Company cannot currently predict the impact of the FSIO, but the Company intends to continue to support outcomes that allow for consolidation and investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in Pennsylvania and in its other regulated jurisdictions.\n51\nTable of Contents\nOther Matters\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety, and Water Quality Regulation\nOn April 10, 2024, the EPA announced a final NPDWR for six PFAS including PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, PFHxS, and PFBS. The NPDWR for PFAS establishes MCLs, for PFAS in drinking water. Utilities will be required to complete their initial monitoring for PFAS by 2027, followed by ongoing compliance monitoring. Utilities will be required to comply with the new MCLs by April 2029, implementing solutions to reduce PFAS levels where needed. Beginning in April 2029, utilities that exceed any of the PFAS MCLs will be required to provide notification to the public of the violation.\nThe Company estimates an investment of approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures to install additional treatment facilities in order to comply with the new regulations by April 2029. Additionally, the Company estimates that it will incur annual operating expenses of up to approximately $50 million related to testing and treatment, with the majority of the operating expenses beginning near the April 2029 compliance deadline. The actual level of capital investment and expenses may differ from these estimates and will be dependent upon market dynamics upon implementation of solutions to comply with the NPDWR for PFAS.\nThe Company has entered into a nine-year exclusive contract with a third-party vendor to supply granular activated carbon, equipment and reactivation services to more than 50 of the Company’s treatment sites across 10 states through 2033. The equipment and services provided through the contract will aid the Company in treating drinking water to assist in complying with the NPDWR for PFAS. \nThe Company supports sound policies and compliance with the NPDWR for PFAS by all water utilities, while protecting customers and communities from the costly burden of monitoring and mitigating PFAS contamination in water systems. The Company continues to advocate for policies that hold polluters accountable and is participating in the multi-district litigation and other lawsuits filed against certain PFAS manufacturers seeking damages and reimbursement of costs incurred and continuing to be incurred to address contamination of public water supply systems by PFAS. For more information on the PFAS multi-district litigation, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings—PFAS Multi-District Litigation.\nOn April 19, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA. The Company, along with a coalition of other water and wastewater organizations, is actively advocating for and supporting bipartisan legislation that would provide PFAS liability protections under CERCLA for water and wastewater systems, as passive receivers of PFAS, and to hold polluters, and not the public or customers, accountable for PFAS-related liability.\nOn October 30, 2024, the EPA published the LCRI with a “Compliance Date” of November 1, 2027. The LCRI focus includes requirements related to (i) replacing all lead and certain galvanized service lines under a utilities control by October 30, 2037, 10 years from the Compliance Date; (ii) \nidentifying the materials of all service lines of unknown material;\n (iii) improving tap sampling; (iv) lowering the lead action level; and (v) strengthening protections to reduce exposure. The LCRI also deferred the compliance date of certain requirements of the LCRR to allow for compliance with both new rules. The Company is in the process of developing an estimate of capital expenditures and operating costs needed to meet the specific requirements of the LCRI. Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with compliance with federal water quality regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. \nThe Company continues to comply with the EPA’s existing Lead and Copper Rule requirements by replacing lead service lines in accordance with current scientific guidance and utilizing appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements. \nThe Company met the LCRR requirements, effective October 16, 2024, identified as enforceable by the EPA. Remaining LCRR requirements are deferred under the LCRI.\nCybersecurity Incident\nOn October 3, 2024, the Company identified unauthorized activity within its information technology computer networks and systems, which was determined to be the result of a cybersecurity incident. Upon identification of this activity, the Company immediately activated its incident response protocols and third-party cybersecurity experts to assist with containment and mitigation activities and to investigate the nature and scope of the incident. The Company also promptly notified law enforcement and has coordinated fully with them. As part of the incident response, and in order to protect its systems and data, the Company disconnected and deactivated certain of its systems, which have since been reconnected and reactivated upon verification that those systems were secure.\n52\nTable of Contents\nAll necessary containment, mitigation and restoration activities related to this incident have been completed. None of the Company’s water or wastewater facilities were impacted by this incident, and the incident did not have a material effect on the Company or its financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a number of putative class action lawsuits have been filed in connection with this cybersecurity incident, primarily alleging claims related to federal and/or state consumer protection and data privacy laws, and while the Company believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending itself against these claims, it cannot currently predict the outcome or impact of these lawsuits. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Cybersecurity Incident Class Action Lawsuits for more information.\nRegulatory Matters\nGeneral Rate Cases\nThe table below summarizes the annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from general rate case authorizations that became effective during 2024. The amounts include reductions for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”) that are generally offset in income tax expense.\n(In millions)\nEffective Date\nAmount\nGeneral rate cases by state:\nKentucky\n(a)\n$\n17 \nNew Jersey\nSeptember 15, 2024\n80 \nPennsylvania\nAugust 7, 2024\n99 \nIndiana, Step Increases\n(b)\n48 \nWest Virginia\nFebruary 25, 2024\n18 \nCalifornia\nJanuary 1, 2024\n21 \nTotal general rate case authorizations\n$\n283 \n(a)\nIn 2024, $6 million was effective November 6 and $11 million was effective May 3.\n(b)\nIn 2024, $23 million was effective May 10 and $25 million was effective February 21.\nThe table below summarizes the annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from general rate case authorizations that became effective on or after January 1, 2025. The amounts include reductions for the amortization of EADIT that are generally offset in income tax expense.\n(In millions)\nEffective Date\nAmount\nGeneral rate cases by state:\nTennessee\nJanuary 21, 2025\n$\n1 \nIllinois\nJanuary 1, 2025\n105 \nTotal general rate case authorizations\n$\n106 \nOn January 21, 2025, the Tennessee Public Utility Commission (the “TPUC”) approved a motion authorizing an adjustment of water base rates requested in a rate case filed on May 1, 2024, by the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary. The TPUC approved an increase of $1 million in annualized revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $18 million, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.70%, authorized rate base of approximately $300 million, a common equity ratio of 44.19% and a debt ratio of 55.81%. This adjustment took effect on January 21, 2025, and is driven primarily by approximately $173 million in capital investments made and to be made by the Tennessee subsidiary through December 2025.\nOn December 5, 2024, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a final order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case originally filed on January 25, 2024, by the Company’s Illinois subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an increase of $105 million in annualized water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $5 million, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.84%, authorized rate base of $2.2 billion, and a capital structure with an equity component of 49.00% and a debt component of 51.00%. The general rate case order denied the second step increase of $16 million. The increase was effective January 1, 2025, and is driven primarily by approximately $557 million in capital investments made and to be made by the Illinois subsidiary from January 2024 through December 2025.\n53\nTable of Contents\nOn December 5, 2024, the CPUC approved a final decision adopting the terms of a partial settlement agreement filed on November 17, 2023, in the Company’s California subsidiary’s general rate case originally filed on July 1, 2022. Incorporating the currently effective return on equity of 10.20%, the decision provides incremental annualized water and wastewater revenues of $21 million in the 2024 test year, and an estimated $16 million in the 2025 escalation year and $16 million in the 2026 attrition year. New rates were implemented retroactively to January 1, 2024. In addition, the CPUC denied the California subsidiary’s proposed Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism but approved continuation of its currently effective Annual Consumption Adjustment Mechanism. On December 12, 2024, the California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the CPUC’s denial of the proposed Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism.\nOn May 3, 2024, the Kentucky Public Service Commission (the “KPSC”) issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on June 30, 2023, by the Company’s Kentucky subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an $11 million annualized increase in water revenues, excluding infrastructure surcharge revenues of $10 million, which continue to be recovered in the Kentucky subsidiary’s approved infrastructure mechanism. The annualized increase is based upon an authorized return on equity of 9.70%, authorized rate base of $489 million, which reflects capital investments through January 31, 2025, and a capital structure with a common equity ratio of 52.22%. Interim rates in this proceeding were effective on February 6, 2024, and the order required that the difference between interim and final approved rates be subject to refund no later than August 26, 2024. On May 16, 2024, the Kentucky subsidiary filed with the KPSC a petition for rehearing of the KPSC’s order, seeking clarification and/or correction of certain computational inconsistencies that the Kentucky subsidiary believes are reflected in the KPSC’s order with respect to the authorized amount of annualized revenues to be received by the Kentucky subsidiary. On November 6, 2024, the KPSC approved a final order (the “Final Order”) providing for a $17 million annualized increase in water revenues, an increase of approximately $6 million from May 3, 2024. New rates provided in the Final Order were effective November 6, 2024.\nOn September 4, 2024, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (“NJBPU”) issued an order approving without modification the stipulation of settlement of a general rate case filed on January 19, 2024, by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an $80 million annualized increase in the New Jersey subsidiary’s water and wastewater revenues, effective September 15, 2024, based on (i) an authorized return on equity of 9.60%, (ii) an authorized rate base of $5.1 billion, (iii) a common equity ratio of 55.00%, and (iv) a long-term debt ratio of 45.00%. The annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by $1.3 billion of incremental capital investments since the New Jersey subsidiary’s last general rate case. The New Jersey subsidiary will continue to defer as a regulatory asset or liability, as appropriate, until its next general rate case, the difference between its pension expense and other postretirement benefits expense and those amounts included in base rates.\nOn July 22, 2024, the PaPUC released an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a general rate case filed by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary on November 8, 2023. The PaPUC approved a $99 million annualized increase in the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $20 million, based on (i) an authorized return on equity of 9.45%, (ii) an authorized rate base of $5.8 billion, which reflects, as requested and included in the general rate case, approximately $1.0 billion in capital investments to be made through mid-2025, (iii) a common equity ratio of 55.30%, and (iv) a long-term debt ratio of 44.70%. Certain acquisitions, including the acquisition of the wastewater collection and treatment system of the Butler Area Sewer Authority, were excluded from authorized base rates. The new rates were effective on August 7, 2024, except that new wastewater rates for two recently acquired systems, including the City of York, will take effect during the first half of 2025 in accordance with the terms of the relevant acquisition agreements. As part of its approval of this rate adjustment, the PaPUC initiated an investigation into certain reported water service and water quality issues in the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s Northeastern service territory, which reports had been provided during public input hearings convened in the general rate case. The PaPUC is expected to conclude the investigation in the second quarter of 2025.\nOn February 23, 2024, the WVPSC issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on May 1, 2023, by the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an $18 million annualized increase in water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $7 million, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.80%, authorized rate base of $886 million, which reflects capital investments through February 2024, a common equity ratio of 50.12% and a long-term debt ratio of 49.88%. The increased water and wastewater revenues related to the base rate adjustment are being driven primarily by (i) $220 million of related water and wastewater system capital investments made since the completion of the West Virginia subsidiary’s previous rate case, (ii) higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and (iii) increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs.\n54\nTable of Contents\nOn February 14, 2024, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the “IURC”) issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on March 31, 2023, by the Company’s Indiana subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $66 million annualized increase in water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.65%, authorized rate base of $1.8 billion, a common equity ratio of 56.15% and a debt ratio of 43.85%. For purposes of determining rates, the adjustment is based on an equity component of 48.19% due to the regulatory practice in Indiana of including certain zero-cost items or tax credit balances in the capital structure calculation. The annualized revenue increase will include three step increases, with $25 million of the increase to be included in rates in February 2024, $23 million in May 2024, and $18 million in May 2025. The increases are being driven primarily by (i) over $875 million of water and wastewater system capital investments since the completion of the Indiana subsidiary’s last rate case and through April 30, 2025, (ii) higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and (iii) increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs.\nPending General Rate Case Filings\nOn August 2, 2024, the Company’s Hawaii subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $2 million in annualized incremental revenues, which is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.67% and a capital structure with an equity component of 52.11% and debt component of 47.89%. The requested annualized incremental revenue is driven primarily by approximately $41 million in capital investments made and to be made by the Hawaii subsidiary through 2025. The Hawaii subsidiary anticipates that the general rate case proceeding will be completed by mid-2025.\nOn July 1, 2024, the Company’s Missouri subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $148 million in annualized incremental revenues. The request is based on a return on equity of 10.75% and a capital structure with an equity component of 50.54% and a long-term debt component of 49.46%. The requested annualized incremental revenue is driven primarily by $1.5 billion of incremental capital investments completed and planned by the Missouri subsidiary from January 2023 through May 2026. On July 31, 2024, the Missouri Public Service Commission issued an order establishing the test year in this case, which modified the Missouri subsidiary’s original proposal for a future test year through May 2026, and instead reverted to a true-up period through December 31, 2024, with an allowance for proposed discrete adjustments subsequent to this date. On September 6, 2024, the Missouri subsidiary filed supplemental testimony to revise the request to approximately $123 million in annualized incremental revenues and define the specific discrete adjustments proposed through the rate effective period, which lowered the incremental capital investments completed and planned to $1.1 billion through May 2025. The Missouri subsidiary anticipates that the general rate case proceeding will be completed by mid-2025.\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company’s Iowa subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $21 million in additional annualized revenues, which is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.75% and a capital structure with an equity component of 52.57% and debt component of 47.43%. The requested annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by approximately $157 million in capital investments made and to be made by the Iowa subsidiary through March 2026. Interim rates became effective May 11, 2024, with the difference between interim and final approved rates subject to refund. On August 29, 2024, the Iowa subsidiary submitted supplemental testimony consistent with the procedural schedule, which was subsequently challenged by the parties in the proceeding. On October 4, 2024, the Iowa Utilities Commission issued an order that granted the inclusion of the supplemental filing and extended the procedural schedule in the case beyond the statutory ten-month period. The Iowa subsidiary now expects resolution of this proceeding by May 2025.\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company’s California subsidiary submitted a request to delay by one year its cost of capital filing and maintain its current authorized cost of capital through 2025. On February 2, 2024, the CPUC granted the request for a one-year extension of the cost of capital filing to May 1, 2025, to set its authorized cost of capital beginning January 1, 2026. On December 18, 2024, the California subsidiary submitted a request to further delay by one year its cost of capital filing and maintain the authorized cost of capital through 2026. On January 14, 2025, the CPUC granted the request for a one-year extension of the cost of capital filing to May 1, 2026, to set its authorized cost of capital beginning January 1, 2027.\n55\nTable of Contents\nOn November 1, 2023, the Company’s Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $20 million in additional annualized revenues. The request is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.95% and a capital structure with an equity component of 45.67% and a debt and other component of 54.33%. The requested increase is driven by approximately $110 million in capital investments between May 2023 and April 2025. The request also proposed a revenue decoupling mechanism and seeks deferral of certain production cost adjustments. Interim rates became effective May 1, 2024, with the difference between interim and final approved rates subject to refund. On September 20, 2024, the Virginia subsidiary filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “SCC”) a “black box” stipulation of settlement on key financial terms which agreed to a $15 million annualized increase in the Virginia subsidiary’s revenues. The stipulation of settlement also agreed, solely for purposes of the Virginia subsidiary’s future filings requiring a stated cost of capital and/or capital structure (including its annual information and water and wastewater infrastructure surcharge filings), that its return on equity will be 9.70% and its capital structure will consist of an equity component of 45.67% and a debt and other component of 54.33%. The stipulation of settlement remains subject to SCC review and approval.\nInfrastructure Surcharges\nA number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective during 2024:\n(In millions)\nEffective Date\nAmount\nInfrastructure surcharges by state:\nMissouri\n(b)\n$\n47 \nPennsylvania\n(c)\n21 \nNew Jersey\nApril 30, 2024\n9 \nIowa\nMarch 1, 2024\n1 \nWest Virginia (a)\nMarch 1, 2024\n7 \nIllinois\nJanuary 1, 2024\n5 \nTotal infrastructure surcharge authorizations\n$\n90 \n(a)\nOn March 5, 2024, the WVPSC directed the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary to interpret the distribution system improvement charge (“DSIC”) Order as having included within the DSIC the three-year amortization of a prior authorized deferral associated with a large treatment plant project. The inclusion of this deferral increased the net incremental revenue by $0.7 million to a total of $6.6 million effective March 1, 2024.\n(b)\nIn 2024, $21 million was effective July 11 and $26 million was effective January 20.\n(c)\nIn 2024, $14 million was effective July 1 and $7 million was effective April 1.\nPresented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective on or after January 1, 2025:\n(In millions)\nEffective Date\nAmount\nInfrastructure surcharge filings by state:\nMissouri\nFebruary 7, 2025\n$\n17 \nKentucky\nJanuary 1, 2025\n2 \nWest Virginia\nJanuary 1, 2025\n4 \nTotal infrastructure surcharge filings\n$\n23 \n56\nTable of Contents\nOther Regulatory Matters\nIn September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that required the Company’s California subsidiary to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would have become effective upon receiving an order in the rate case. On October 5, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the decision and following the CPUC’s denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review with the California Supreme Court on October 27, 2021. On May 18, 2022, the California Supreme Court issued a writ of review for the California subsidiary’s petition and the petitions filed by other entities challenging the decision. On July 8, 2024, the California Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion concluding that the CPUC did not regularly seek to exercise its authority when it prohibited water utilities from proposing to continue their water revenue adjustment mechanisms. Accordingly, the California Supreme Court vacated the portion of the CPUC’s 2020 decision relating to this prohibition against continuation of such water revenue adjustment mechanisms.\nIndependent of the judicial challenge, California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporation’s revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022, and became effective on January 1, 2023. In response to the legislation, on January 27, 2023, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an updated application requesting the CPUC to consider a Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism in its 2022 general rate case. On December 5, 2024, the CPUC denied the California subsidiary’s proposed Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism but approved continuation of its currently effective Annual Consumption Adjustment Mechanism. On December 12, 2024, the California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the CPUC’s denial of the proposed Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism.\nOn March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the NJBPU that recommended denial of a petition filed by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfield’s water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJ’s initial decision without modification. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. On December 30, 2024, the New Jersey Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the NJBPU decision rejecting the acquisition adjustments. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the NJBPU’s order and resulting appeal decision, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n57\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nPresented in the table below are the Company’s consolidated results of operations:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating revenues\n$\n4,684 \n$\n4,234 \n$\n3,792 \nOperating expenses:\n \n \n \nOperation and maintenance\n1,858 \n1,720 \n1,589 \nDepreciation and amortization\n788 \n704 \n649 \nGeneral taxes\n320 \n307 \n281 \nOther\n— \n(1)\n— \nTotal operating expenses, net\n2,966 \n2,730 \n2,519 \nOperating income\n1,718 \n1,504 \n1,273 \nOther income (expense):\n \n \n \nInterest expense\n(523)\n(460)\n(433)\nInterest Income\n94 \n73 \n52 \nNon-operating benefit costs, net\n28 \n32 \n77 \nGain on sale of businesses\n— \n— \n19 \nOther, net\n42 \n47 \n20 \nTotal other income (expense)\n(359)\n(308)\n(265)\nIncome before income taxes\n1,359 \n1,196 \n1,008 \nProvision for income taxes\n308 \n252 \n188 \nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n1,051 \n$\n944 \n$\n820 \nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Company’s operating segments are comprised of its businesses which generate revenue, incur expense and have separate financial information which is regularly used by the chief operating decision maker to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its business primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. Other primarily includes MSG, which does not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP. Other\n also includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Company’s \nRegulated Businesses\n, i\nnterest income related to the secured seller promissory note from the sale of HOS, income from assets not associated with the Regulated Businesses, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments related to acquisitions that have not been allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment.\n \nThis presentation is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.

(ii) a $41 million increase from water and wastewater acquisitions and organic growth in existing systems; (iii) a $26 million increase from changes in customer demand; and (iv) a $17 million net increase as a result of reduced amortization of EADIT, primarily in the Company’s Missouri subsidiary.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOperation and Maintenance\nPresented in the table below is information regarding the main components of the Regulated Businesses’ operating and maintenance expense:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEmployee-related costs\n$\n543 \n$\n513 \n$\n505 \nProduction costs\n458 \n438 \n387 \nOperating supplies and services\n274 \n255 \n242 \nMaintenance materials and supplies\n97 \n102 \n96 \nCustomer billing and accounting\n72 \n65 \n59 \nOther\n73 \n68 \n56 \nTotal operation and maintenance expense\n$\n1,517 \n$\n1,441 \n$\n1,345 \nEmployee-Related Costs\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSalaries and wages\n$\n434 \n$\n413 \n$\n395 \nGroup insurance\n69 \n60 \n59 \nPensions\n7 \n9 \n21 \nOther benefits\n33 \n31 \n30 \nTotal employee-related costs\n$\n543 \n$\n513 \n$\n505 \nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, employee-related costs increased $30 million primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages due to merit increases, which was partially offset by higher capitalized labor and overhead rates.\nProduction Costs\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPurchased water\n$\n180 \n$\n161 \n$\n154 \nFuel and power\n112 \n108 \n104 \nChemicals\n107 \n105 \n78 \nWaste disposal\n59 \n64 \n51 \nTotal production costs\n$\n458 \n$\n438 \n$\n387 \nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, production costs increased $20 million primarily from higher purchased water cost and usage.\nOperating Supplies and Services\nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, operating supplies and services increased $19 million primarily due to higher contracted services and software licensing costs as well as an increase in various other operating expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, depreciation and amortization increased $79 million primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service from capital infrastructure investments and acquisitions.\nGeneral Taxes\nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, general taxes increased $13 million primarily due to incremental property taxes and New Jersey Gross Receipts Tax.\n60\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expense)\nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, other expenses increased $70 million primarily due to higher interest expense from the issuance of incremental long-term debt and a decrease in AFUDC in 2024.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, the Regulated Businesses’ provision for income taxes increased $43 million. The Regulated Businesses’ effective income tax rate was 22.1% and 21.1% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the decrease in the amortization of EADIT, pursuant to regulatory orders. The amortization of EADIT is generally offset with reductions in revenue. \nOther \nPresented in the table below is information for Other:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating revenues\n$\n388 \n$\n314 \n$\n287 \nOperation and maintenance\n341 \n279 \n244 \nDepreciation and amortization\n16 \n11 \n16 \nGeneral taxes\n19 \n19 \n17 \nInterest expense\n(107)\n(96)\n(119)\nInterest income\n77 \n45 \n50 \nGain on sale of businesses\n— \n— \n19 \nOther income\n10 \n12 \n6 \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n6 \n(7)\n— \nNet loss attributable to common shareholders\n$\n(14)\n$\n(27)\n$\n(34)\nOperating Revenues\nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, operating revenues increased $74 million from an increase in capital projects in MSG, primarily at Naval Station Mayport, and an increase in capital projects in CSG.\nOperation and Maintenance\nPresented in the table below is information regarding the main components of Other’s operating and maintenance expense:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating supplies and services\n$\n195 \n$\n150 \n$\n120 \nMaintenance materials and supplies\n27 \n29 \n35 \nEmployee-related costs\n101 \n85 \n73 \nProduction costs\n10 \n9 \n10 \nOther\n8 \n6 \n6 \nTotal operation and maintenance expense\n$\n341 \n$\n279 \n$\n244 \nOperating Supplies and Services\nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, operating supplies and services increased $45 million primarily due to costs associated with the increased capital projects in MSG.\nEmployee-Related Costs\nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, employee-related costs increased $16 million primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages. \n61\nTable of Contents\nInterest Income\nIn 2024, as compared to 2023, interest income increased $32 million primarily due to the increased interest rate and higher principal balance from the February 2024 amendment of the secured seller promissory note from the sale of HOS. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures—Sale of Homeowner Services Group, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTax Matters\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA contains a 15% CAMT provision on applicable corporations effective January 1, 2023. To determine if a company is considered an applicable corporation subject to CAMT, the company’s average adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) for the three consecutive years preceding the tax year must exceed $1.0 billion. An applicable corporation must make several adjustments to net income when determining AFSI. A corporation paying CAMT is eligible for a future tax credit, which can be utilized when regular tax exceeds CAMT. Based on current guidance, the Company is an applicable corporation subject to CAMT beginning in 2024 and expects to owe CAMT in excess of the regular tax liability. On September 12, 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and the U.S. Treasury issued Notice 2024-66, allowing corporate taxpayers to exclude amounts attributable to the CAMT liability, without penalty, from estimated tax payments with respect to a taxable year that begins during 2024. The Company will include the CAMT liability in its 2024 extension payment due April 15, 2025. The Company will continue to assess the impacts of the IRA as the U.S. Treasury and the IRS provide further guidance.\nLegislative Updates\nDuring 2024 and 2025, the Company’s regulatory jurisdictions enacted the following legislation that has been approved and is effective as of February 19, 2025:\n•\nNew Jersey passed Assembly Bill 4791, establishing the “Resiliency and Environmental System Investment Charge Program,” which creates a regulatory mechanism that enables water and wastewater utilities to recover the costs of investment in certain non-revenue producing utility system components that enhance water and wastewater system resiliency, environmental compliance such as existing and proposed requirements for PFAS, safety, and public health. Legislation was signed by the Governor and became effective on January 12, 2024.\n•\nIndiana passed Senate Bill 5, which provides access to a property by a water utility to replace lead service lines when a landown\ner does not enroll in the offered lead service line replacement program, does not personally replace the customer owned portion of the lead service line following notice and a 45-day waiting period, or is non-responsive to attempted communication after the 45-day waiting period. Legislation was signed by the Governor and became effective on March 11, 2024. \n•\nIowa passed House File 207, \nwhich modifies property tax assessments to exempt property owned or operated by a public or private utility and is directly and primarily used for furnishing sanitary sewage or storm water drainage disposal by a piped collection system to the public for compensation. Legislation was signed by the Governor and became effective on May 2, 2024.\n•\nWest Virginia passed House Bill 5617, which adopts standards and authorizes the WVPSC to promulgate rules, and also allows for rate recovery, on maintenance, flushing, flow testing and marking of fire hydrants owned by water utilities. Legislation was signed by the Governor and became effective on June 4, 2024.\n•\nIowa passed House File 2101, which increases the threshold amount required for approval by the Iowa Utilities Commission for water and wastewater utility acquisition filings from $0.5 million to $3 million. Legislation was signed by the Governor \nand became effective on July 1, 2024.\n•\nIndiana passed Senate Bill 247, which establishes a 30-day filing with the IURC by a utility for an acquisition of a utility with an appraised value and purchase price of less than $3 million. Legislation was signed by the Governor became effective on July 1, 2024.\n•\nCalifornia passed Senate Bill 219, which amends the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, to allow the California Air Resources Board until July 1, 2025, to issue implementing regulations, including reporting requirements for Scope 3 emissions. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 27, 2024, and became effective January 1, 2025.\n62\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company uses its capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities, (iii) pay dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) to pay federal income taxes. The Company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a long-term return on investment. Additionally, the Company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Regulation and Rate Making for additional information. The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of long-term debt and equity issuances, in addition to the remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS. The remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS include receipt of payments under a secured seller promissory note, plus interest, see Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures —Sale of Homeowner Services Group, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.\nThe Company regularly evaluates and monitors its cash requirements for capital investments, acquisitions, operations, commitments, debt maturities, interest and dividends. The Company’s business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. The Company also obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings, and may also access the equity capital markets as needed or desired to support capital funding requirements. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, AWCC issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. The Company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms may depend on, as appropriate, any or all of the following: current business conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general; conditions in the debt or equity capital markets; the Company’s credit ratings; and conditions in the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the Company’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets. \nIf these unfavorable business, market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Company is no longer able to access the commercial paper and/or capital markets on reasonable terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company’s revolving credit facility provides $2.75 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. AWCC’s revolving credit facility is used principally to support its commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support, and to provide a sub-limit for the issuance of up to $150 million in letters of credit. The maximum aggregate principal amount of short-term borrowings authorized for issuance under AWCC’s commercial paper program is $2.60 billion. On October 28, 2024, the termination date of the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility was extended, as permitted by the terms of the credit agreement, from October 2028 to October 2029. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500 million. As of December 31, 2024, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $82 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $1.8 billion available to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. \nThe Company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the Company’s short-term requirements. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, there can be no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCC will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are generally greater during the warmer months. The Company’s future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by, among other things: customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner, economic utility regulation, inflation, compliance with environmental, health and safety standards, production costs, maintenance costs, customer growth, declining customer usage of water, employee-related costs, including pension funding, weather and seasonality, taxes and overall economic conditions. The Company’s current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the use of short-term debt as a funding source, primarily to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, fund acquisitions and construction projects, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business and other factors. The Company addresses cash timing differences primarily through its short-term liquidity funding mechanisms.\n63\nTable of Contents\nPresented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Company’s cash flows from operating activities:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n1,051 \n$\n944 \n$\n820 \nAdd (less):\n \n \n \nDepreciation and amortization\n788 \n704 \n649 \nDeferred income taxes and amortization of investment tax credits\n156 \n208 \n80 \nOther non-cash activities (a)\n62 \n(9)\n(16)\nChanges in assets and liabilities (b)\n40 \n76 \n(355)\nPension and non-pension postretirement benefit contributions\n(52)\n(49)\n(51)\nGain on sale of businesses\n— \n— \n(19)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,045 \n$\n1,874 \n$\n1,108 \n(a)\nIncludes provision for losses on accounts receivable, pension and non-pension postretirement benefits and other non-cash, net. Details of each component can be found on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n(b)\nChanges in assets and liabilities include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, income tax receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, accrued taxes and other assets and liabilities, net.\nIn 2024, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $171 million, primarily due to an increase in net income and depreciation, partially offset by changes in deferred income taxes.\nThe Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $44 million in 2025. Actual amounts contributed could change materially from this estimate as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nPresented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Company’s cash flows from investing activities:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCapital expenditures\n$\n(2,856)\n$\n(2,575)\n$\n(2,297)\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\n(417)\n(81)\n(315)\nProceeds from sale of assets, net of cash on hand\n— \n— \n608 \nRemoval costs from property, plant and equipment retirements, net\n(152)\n(159)\n(123)\nPurchases of available-for-sale fixed-income securities\n(135)\n— \n— \nProceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale fixed-income securities\n181 \n— \n— \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(3,379)\n$\n(2,815)\n$\n(2,127)\nIn 2024, cash flows used in investing activities increased $564 million as a result of increased payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions in 2024. The Company continues to invest across all infrastructure categories, mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution and services, meter and fire hydrants infrastructure in the Company’s Regulated Businesses, as discussed below. \nThe Company’s infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where the Company replaces mains, services, meters, hydrants and valves, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where the Company constructs new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth, and meet new or updated environmental and water quality regulations. The Company’s projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.\n64\nTable of Contents\nPresented in the table below is a summary of the Company’s capital expenditures by category:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTransmission and distribution\n$\n882 \n$\n922 \n$\n901 \nTreatment and pumping\n305 \n322 \n190 \nServices, meter and fire hydrants\n805 \n652 \n546 \nGeneral structure and equipment\n425 \n333 \n380 \nSources of supply\n163 \n88 \n95 \nWastewater\n276 \n258 \n185 \nTotal capital expenditures\n$\n2,856 \n$\n2,575 \n$\n2,297 \nIn 2024, the Company’s capital expenditures increased $281 million due to an increase across most infrastructure categories.\nThe Company also grows its business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems. These acquisitions are generally located in geographic proximity to the Company’s existing Regulated Businesses and support continued geographical diversification and growth of its operations. Generally, acquisitions are funded initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with long-term financing. During 2024, the Company paid $417 million to fund acquisitions, including deposits for pending acquisitions. The Company closed on 13 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems during 2024, which added approximately 69,500 water and wastewater customers.\nAs previously noted, over the next five years the Company expects to invest between $17 billion to $18 billion, with $15.5 billion to $16 billion for infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses, and the Company expects to invest between $40 billion to $42 billion over the next 10 years. In 2025, the Company expects to invest $3.3 billion, consisting of infrastructure improvements and acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nPresented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Company’s cash flows from financing activities:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nProceeds from long-term debt\n$\n1,437 \n$\n1,264 \n$\n822 \nRepayments of long-term debt\n(475)\n(282)\n(15)\nNet proceeds from common stock financing\n— \n1,688 \n— \nNet short-term borrowings (repayments) with maturities less than three months\n700 \n(996)\n591 \nDebt issuance costs\n(14)\n(16)\n(7)\nDividends paid\n(585)\n(532)\n(467)\nOther financing activities, net \n(a)\n47 \n62 \n76 \nNet cash provided by financing activities\n$\n1,110 \n$\n1,188 \n$\n1,000 \n(a)\nIncludes proceeds from issuances of common stock under various employee stock plans and the Company’s dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan, net of taxes paid, and advances and contributions in aid of construction, net of refunds.\nIn 2024, cash flows provided by financing activities decreased $78 million, primarily due to the repayment of long-term debt in the current period and the proceeds from the common stock financing in March 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a higher issuance of long-term debt and an increase in short-term commercial paper borrowings in the current year.\n65\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s financing activities are primarily focused on funding regulated infrastructure expenditures, regulated acquisitions and payment of dividends. These activities included the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through AWCC and equity issuances from parent company. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and the Company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings to the Regulated Businesses and parent company. The Regulated Businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. Parent company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the Regulated Businesses, therefore, parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates. As of December 31, 2024, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and short-term loans to the Regulated Businesses amounting to $9.6 billion. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and short-term loans to parent company amounting to $3.3 billion.\nOn February 23, 2024, AWCC completed a $1.4 billion debt offering, which included the sale of $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.150% Senior Notes due 2034 and $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.450% Senior Notes due 2054. At the closing of this offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1,381 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of the offering (i) to lend funds to American Water and the Regulated Businesses; (ii) to repay at maturity AWCC’s 3.850% Senior Notes due 2024; (iii) to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.\nOn March 3, 2023, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 12,650,000 shares of parent company common stock. Upon closing of this offering, the Company received, after deduction of the underwriting discount and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1,688 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to repay short-term commercial paper obligations of AWCC and for general corporate purposes.\nOn June 29, 2023, AWCC issued, in a private placement, $1,035 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. AWCC received net proceeds of approximately $1,022 million, after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deduction of offering expenses payable by AWCC. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. See Note 11—Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOne of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as treasury lock agreements. The Company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company (through AWCC) does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.\nDuring the second half of 2024, the Company entered into eight treasury lock agreements, with a term of 10 years or 30 years, with notional amounts totaling $355 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2025. These treasury lock agreements terminate in June 2025 and December 2025 and have an average fixed interest rate of 4.03%. In 2025, the Company entered into five additional treasury lock agreements, with a term of 10 years, with notional amounts totaling $275 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2025. These treasury lock agreements terminate in March 2025 and have an average fixed interest rate of 4.60%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss.\nThe Company had entered into 15 treasury lock agreements through February 2024, with notional amounts totaling $825 million. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. In February 2024, the Company terminated the treasury lock agreements realizing a pre-tax net gain of $14 million, to be amortized through Interest expense over a 10-year period or 30-year period, in accordance with the tenor of the notes issued on February 23, 2024.\nNo ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n66\nTable of Contents\nIn February 2024, parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables the Company to meet its capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities, including American Water common stock, preferred stock, and other equity and hybrid securities, and AWCC debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, and as applicable, rating status. The shelf registration statement will expire in February 2027. During 2024 and 2022, $1.4 billion and $800 million, respectively, of debt securities were issued under this and a predecessor registration statement. During 2023, under the predecessor registration statement, parent company issued 12,650,000 shares of its common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1,688 million.\nPresented in the table below are the issuances of long-term debt in 2024:\nCompany\nType\nRate\nWeighted Average Rate\nMaturity\nAmount \n(in millions)\nAWCC\n (a)\nSenior notes—fixed rate\n5.15%-5.45%\n5.30%\n2034-2054\n$\n1,400 \nOther American Water subsidiaries\nPrivate activity bonds and government funded debt—fixed rate\n0.00%-1.75%\n0.01%\n2025-2061\n46 \nTotal issuances\n \n \n \n$\n1,446 \n(a)\nThis indebtedness is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s payment obligations under such indebtedness.

The Notes were issued under an indenture, by and among AWCC, parent company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee, providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the Notes. The senior notes and the Notes have been issued with the benefit of a support agreement, as amended, between parent company and AWCC, which serves as the functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s payment obligations under such indebtedness. No other subsidiary of parent company provides guarantees for any of such indebtedness. If AWCC is unable to make timely payment of any interest, principal or premium, if any, on such senior notes or the Notes, parent company will provide to AWCC, at its request or the request of any holder thereof, funds to make such payment in full. If AWCC fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce certain rights under the support agreement or if AWCC defaults in the timely payment of any amounts owed to any such holder, when due, the support agreement provides that such holder may proceed directly against parent company to enforce such rights or to obtain payment of the defaulted amounts owed to that holder.\n67\nTable of Contents\nAs a wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, AWCC has no significant assets other than obligations of parent company and certain of its subsidiaries in its Regulated Businesses segment to repay certain intercompany loans made to them by AWCC. AWCC’s ability to make payments of amounts owed to holders of the senior notes and the Notes will be dependent upon AWCC’s receipt of sufficient payments of amounts owed pursuant to the terms of such intercompany loans and from its ability to issue indebtedness or otherwise obtain loans in the future, the proceeds of which would be used to fund the repayment of the senior notes and the Notes.\nBecause parent company is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries other than AWCC, parent company’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the support agreement will be dependent upon its receipt of sufficient cash dividends or distributions from its operating subsidiaries. See Note 9—Shareholders’ Equity—Dividends and Distributions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions. Furthermore, parent company’s operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, other than AWCC, have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or the Notes or to make available or provide any funds for such payment, other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans, if any, with AWCC. Based on the foregoing, parent company’s obligations under the support agreement will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, lease commitments and moneys borrowed or other indebtedness incurred or issued by parent company’s subsidiaries other than AWCC.\nCredit Facilities and Short-Term Debt\nInterest rates on advances under the AWCC revolving credit facility are based on a credit spread to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate, each determined in accordance with Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million for letters of credit. Indebtedness under the facility and AWCC’s commercial paper are considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s payment obligations thereunder.\nPresented in the tables below are the aggregate credit facility commitments, commercial paper limit and letter of credit availability under the revolving credit facility, as well as the available capacity for each, as of December 31:\n2024\n(In millions)\nCommercial Paper Limit\nLetters of Credit\nTotal (a)\nTotal availability\n$\n2,600 \n$\n150 \n$\n2,750 \nOutstanding debt\n(880)\n(82)\n(962)\nRemaining availability as of December 31, 2024\n$\n1,720 \n$\n68 \n$\n1,788 \n(a)\nTotal remaining availability of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, was accessible through revolver draws.\n2023\n(In millions)\nCommercial Paper Limit\nLetters of Credit\nTotal (a)\nTotal availability\n$\n2,600 \n$\n150 \n$\n2,750 \nOutstanding debt\n(180)\n(75)\n(255)\nRemaining availability as of December 31, 2023\n$\n2,420 \n$\n75 \n$\n2,495 \n(a)\nTotal remaining availability of $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2023, was accessible through revolver draws.\nPresented in the table below is the Company’s total available liquidity as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n(In millions)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAvailability on Revolving Credit Facility\nTotal Available Liquidity\nAvailable liquidity as of December 31, 2024\n$\n96 \n$\n1,788 \n$\n1,884 \nAvailable liquidity as of December 31, 2023\n$\n330 \n$\n2,495 \n$\n2,825 \nThe weighted average interest rate on AWCC’s outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 4.65% and 5.51%, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n68\nTable of Contents\nCapital Structure\nPresented in the table below is the percentage of the Company’s capitalization represented by the components of its capital structure as of December 31:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal common shareholders’ equity\n42.4 \n%\n44.2 \n%\n38.3 \n%\nLong-term debt and redeemable preferred stock at redemption value\n51.4 \n%\n52.9 \n%\n54.4 \n%\nShort-term debt and current portion of long-term debt\n6.2 \n%\n2.9 \n%\n7.3 \n%\nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nThe change in the capital structure mix in 2024 is mainly attributable to the increase in short-term commercial paper borrowings. The use of the proceeds from the common stock issuance on March 3, 2023, and the long-term debt issuance on June 29, 2023, reduced short-term commercial paper borrowings in 2023.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Company’s debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the Company, or its subsidiaries, may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt secured by the Company’s assets, subject to certain exceptions. Failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.\nCovenants in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2024, the Company’s ratio was 0.58 to 1.00 and therefore the Company was in compliance with the covenants.\nSecurity Ratings\nPresented in the table below are long-term and short-term credit ratings and rating outlooks as of February 19, 2025, as issued by Moody’s Ratings on January 23, 2025, and S&P Global Ratings on March 4, 2024:\nSecurities\nMoody’s Ratings\nS&P Global Ratings\nRating outlook\nStable\nStable\nSenior unsecured debt\nBaa1\nA\nCommercial paper\nP-2\nA-1\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain its existing ratings. The Company does not have any material borrowings that are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility.\nAs part of its normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, power and other fuel, chemicals and other services. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide collateral to secure its obligations. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n69\nTable of Contents\nAccess to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the Company’s securities ratings. The Company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, the Company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of mortgage bonds and tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower the overall cost of debt.\nDividends and Regulatory Restrictions\nFor discussion of the Company’s dividends, dividend restrictions and dividend policy, see Note 9—Shareholders’ Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInsurance Coverage\nThe Company carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. Additionally, annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience or adverse insurance market trends which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. The Company is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s short-term and long-term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and develop estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the Company’s Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. Additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRegulation and Regulatory Accounting\nThe Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs and, as such, the Company follows the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the Company to reflect the effects of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As of December 31, 2024, the Company concluded that the operations of its utilities met the criteria.\nApplication of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. The Company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.\nFor each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. If subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and financial position could be materially affected. In addition, if the Company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria, the Company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n70\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s regulatory asset balance was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and its regulatory liability balance was $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. See Note 3—Regulatory Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company’s significant regulatory assets and liabilities.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.\nIn accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Company records valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.\nUnder GAAP, specifically Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC 740”), \nIncome Taxes\n, the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. For the Company’s regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability and may be subject to refund to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment to earnings.\nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for the Regulated Businesses, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. The resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance; however, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 14—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nAccounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits\nThe Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations. The Company also maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. See Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15—Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.\nThe Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptions are:\n•\nDiscount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.\n71\nTable of Contents\n•\nExpected Return on Plan Assets (“EROA”)—Management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily based upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the Company records currently.\n•\nRate of Compensation Increase—Management projects employees’ pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement.\n•\nHealth Care Cost Trend Rate—Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.\n•\nMortality— Management adopted the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 base mortality table, the most recent table developed from private pension plan experience, which provides rates of mortality in 2012 and adopted the MP-2021 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2012.\nThe discount rate assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. The weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining pension benefit obligations was 5.70%, 5.18% and 5.58% at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 5.69%, 5.22% and 5.60% at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn selecting an EROA, the Company considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. The weighted-average EROA assumption used in calculating pension cost was 6.73% for 2024, 6.79% for 2023 and 6.50% for 2022. The weighted-average EROA assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 5.00% for 2024, 5.00% for 2023 and 3.60% for 2022.\nPresented in the table below are the allocations of the pension plan assets by asset category:\n \n2025 Target Allocation\nPercentage of Plan Assets as of December 31,\nAsset Category\n2024\n2023\nEquity securities\n37 \n%\n44 \n%\n41 \n%\nFixed income\n63 \n%\n56 \n%\n59 \n%\nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nPresented in the table below are the allocations of the other postretirement benefit plan assets by asset category:\n \n2025 Target Allocation (a)\nPercentage of Plan Assets as of December 31,\nAsset Category\n2024\n2023\nEquity securities\n27 \n%\n34 \n%\n32 \n%\nFixed income\n73 \n%\n66 \n%\n68 \n%\nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n(a)\nRefer to Note 15—Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the allocations of assets and the trusts which fund the other postretirement benefit plans\nThe investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts are invested in a number of separately managed accounts, commingled funds and limited partnerships including equities, fixed income securities, guaranteed annuity contracts with insurance companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts. The trustee for the Company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets.\nIn selecting a rate of compensation increase, the Company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. The Company’s rate of compensation increase was 3.51% for 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nIn selecting health care cost trend rates, the Company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of \nJanuary 1, \n2024\n,\n the Company’s health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic benefit cost was 6.75% in 2024 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2031 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2024, the Company projects that medical inflation will be 6.50% in 2025 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2031 and thereafter.\n72\nTable of Contents\nThe Company will use a weighted-average discount rate and EROA of 5.70% and 6.63%, respectively, for estimating its 2025 pension costs. Additionally, the Company will use a weighted-average discount rate and EROA of 5.69% and 5.00%, respectively, for estimating its 2025 other postretirement benefit costs. A decrease in the discount rate or the EROA would increase the Company’s pension expense. The Company’s 2024 pension and postretirement total net benefit credit was $3 million and the 2023 pension and postretirement total net benefit credit was $6 million. The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $44 million in 2025; however, the actual amounts contributed could change materially from this estimate. The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. Revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.\nIncreases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $219 million and $193 million, respectively.\nThe Company also recognizes revenues for certain ratemaking mechanisms that meet the criteria for alternative revenue program accounting. These mechanisms, which include the Company’s revenue stability mechanisms, qualify as alternative revenue programs if they have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected within 24 months following the end of the period in which they were recognized. \nThe Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on military installations and facilities owned by municipal customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues or other long-term assets, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current or long-term liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. Unbilled revenue within Other as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $96 million and $109 million, respectively.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nThe Company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limited to: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases or situations. The Company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred. The Company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonable range.\nActual amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies.\n73\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting standards.\nITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. The Company is exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. The Company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The Company also has the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments, which could include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 1% increase in average interest rates applied to the Company’s short-term borrowing balances throughout 2024 would result in an increased annual interest expense of approximately $2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had eight treasury lock agreements, each with a term of 10 years or 30 years, with notional amounts totaling $355 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2025. These treasury lock agreements terminate in June 2025 and December 2025 and have an average fixed rate of 4.03%. When entering into treasury locks, the Company is subject to market risk with respect to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate that impacts the fair value of the treasury locks. The Company manages market risk by matching the terms of the treasury locks with the critical terms of the expected debt issuance. The fair value of the treasury locks at December 31, 2024, was in a gain position of $24 million. A hypothetical 1% favorable change in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the treasury locks to a gain position of approximately $60 million at December 31, 2024.\nThe Company’s risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover price increases through rates, in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism, as authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction. Non-performance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe market price of the Company’s common stock may experience fluctuations, which may be unrelated to its operating performance. In particular, the Company’s stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. These could include, among other things, interest rate movements, quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions. This volatility may make it difficult for the Company to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of its common stock or other equity securities, regardless of its financial performance, and such difficulty may preclude the Company from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk through its water, wastewater and related services. The Company’s Regulated Businesses serve residential, commercial, industrial and other customers, while the businesses within Other engage in business activities with government entities and other customers. The Company’s primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accounts receivable balances. The Company’s credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements. The Company’s credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations. In addition, the Regulated Businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates.\nThe Company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact the Company’s pension and other benefits expense, funded status and future minimum funding requirements. Changes in interest rates can impact retirement liabilities. The Company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar to that of its pension liabilities, seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities. That way, if interest rates fall and liabilities increase, the Company expects that the fixed-income assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value. The Company also expects its risk to be reduced through its ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates.\n74\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates. The credit quality of the Company’s customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes. In addition, there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations. Therefore, the Company’s ability to fully recover operating expense, recover its investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in the Regulated Businesses may be adversely impacted.\n75\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \nPage\nAudited Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n(PCAOB ID \n238\n)\n77\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 202\n4\n and 202\n3\n79\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 202\n2\n81\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 202\n2\n82\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 202\n2\n83\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 202\n2\n84\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n85\n76\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nAmerican Water Works Company, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries\n \n(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,\n \nand the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).\n \nWe also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, \nand the results of its\n \noperations and its\n \ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated\n \nfinancial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\n \nconsolidated\n \nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n77\nTable of Contents\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated regulatory assets and liabilities balances were $1,169 million and\n \n$1,416 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. The Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions and the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As disclosed by management, for each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (\nincluding recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) \nand the status of any pending or potential legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities relative to whether regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement as a result of changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders, and the status of any pending or potential legislation. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to management’s judgments.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s regulatory accounting process, including controls over management’s assessment and consideration of factors related to the probability of future recovery or settlement. These procedures also\n \nincluded, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the probability of recovery and settlement based on the Company’s correspondence with regulators, status of regulatory proceedings, past practices, and other relevant information; evaluating the related accounting and disclosure implications; and evaluating regulatory asset and liability balances based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with the Company’s regulators.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPhiladelphia,

Financial Statements.\n84\nTable of Contents\nAmerican Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unless otherwise noted, in millions, except per share data)\nNote 1: Organization and Operation\nAmerican Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company” or “American Water”) is a holding company for subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services throughout the United States. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries. The Company’s primary business involves the ownership of regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services in \n14\n states in the United States, collectively referred to as the “Regulated Businesses.” The Company also operates other businesses that provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities. These other businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and are collectively presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K within “Other.”\n See Note 20—Segment Information for additional information.\nNote 2: Significant Accounting Policies\nRegulation\nThe Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs”). As such, the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. PUCs generally authorize revenue at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments, or rate base. Regulators may also approve accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of a regulated utility’s revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, these principles also require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.\n See Note 3—Regulatory Matters for additional information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considers its critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of regulatory accounting principles and the related determination and estimation of regulatory assets and liabilities, (ii) revenue recognition and the estimates used in the calculation of unbilled revenue, (iii) accounting for income taxes, (iv) benefit plan assumptions and (v) the estimates and judgments used in determining loss contingencies. The Company’s critical accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory assets and liabilities, income taxes, benefit plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Company’s regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement of retirement units of utility plant are capitalized and include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering and supervision, transportation and an allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). Costs for repair, maintenance and minor replacements are charged to O&M expense as incurred.\nThe cost of utility plant is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, group method. The Company’s regulated utilities record depreciation in conformity with amounts approved by PUCs, after regulatory review of the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the assets’ remaining useful lives.\n85\nTable of Contents\nNonutility property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the Military Services Group (“MSG”) and for internal operations. This property is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.\nWhen units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulated depreciation. To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset is recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. These amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to retire those assets are incurred.\nThe costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property.\n The carrying value of these costs, net of amortization, amounted to $\n398\n million and $\n419\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds\nSubstantially all cash is invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted funds consist primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future services under O&M projects, primarily performed by MSG. Proceeds are held in escrow or interest-bearing accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or long-term based upon the intended use of the funds.\nPresented in the table below is a reconciliation of the cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds amounts as presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the sum of such amounts presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31:\n \n2024\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n96\n \n$\n330\n \nRestricted funds\n29\n \n34\n \nRestricted funds included in other long-term assets\n15\n \n—\n \nCash and cash equivalents and restricted funds as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n$\n140\n \n$\n364\n \nAccounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenues\nAccounts receivable include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers generally on a monthly basis. Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are the trade accounts receivable of other businesses, primarily MSG, and nonutility customer receivables of the Regulated Businesses. Unbilled revenues are accrued when service has been provided but has not been billed to customers and when costs exceed billings on certain construction contracts.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nAllowances for uncollectible accounts are maintained for estimated probable losses resulting from the Company’s inability to collect receivables from customers. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due, previous loss history, current economic and societal conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of receivables from customers. The Company generally writes off accounts when they become uncollectible or are over a certain number of days outstanding.\n See Note 7—Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts for additional information.\nMaterials and Supplies\nMaterials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method.\n86\nTable of Contents\nSeller Promissory Note\nThe Company’s secured seller promissory note is accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 310, \nReceivables\n, and is classified as held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost at the present value of consideration received for the sale of its Homeowner Services Group (“HOS”) business. Interest income from the secured seller promissory note is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and earned over the contractual life of the loan.\n \nLeases\nThe Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include operating leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.\n ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are generally recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of discounted lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of discounted lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. ROU assets also include any upfront lease payments and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs), which are generally accounted for separately; however, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for certain leases. Certain lease agreements include variable rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Additionally, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized and must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\nThe Company’s goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Company’s previous owner in 2003 and has been allocated to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the reporting units in the Regulated Businesses segment are aggregated into a single reporting unit. The goodwill of Other is attributable to the MSG reporting unit.\nThe Company’s annual impairment testing is performed as of November 30 of each year. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, is more likely than not, less than its carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based assessment is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nApplication of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting units. Management estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount rate and growth rate.\nThe Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n See Note 8—Goodwill for additional information.\n87\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill, primarily include property, plant and equipment. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The Company determines if long-lived assets are potentially impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value when indicators of impairment exist. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value.\nThe long-lived assets of the Company’s regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable.\nThe Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value long-lived assets to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdvances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction\nRegulated utility subsidiaries may receive advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas.\nAdvances are refundable for limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled.\n Included in other current liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are estimated refunds of $\n21\n million and $\n18\n million, respectively. \nThese amounts represent expected refunds during the next 12-month period.\nAdvances that are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction. Contributions in aid of construction are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particular construction project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-investor supplied funds.\nGenerally, the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions in aid of construction balance as a reduction to depreciation expense, producing a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines, some of the Company’s utility subsidiaries do not amortize contributions in aid of construction, and any contribution received remains on the balance sheet indefinitely.\n Amortization of contributions in aid of construction was $\n46\n million, $\n40\n million and $\n37\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnder ASC Topic 606, \nRevenue From Contracts With Customers, \nand\n \nall related amendments (collectively, “ASC 606”), a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to a customer. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for goods or services. Under ASC 606, a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identifies the contracts with a customer; (ii) identifies the performance obligations within the contract, including whether any performance obligations are distinct and capable of being distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) determines the transaction price; (iv) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizes revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nThe Company’s revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below. Customer payments for contracts are generally due within \n30\n days of billing and none of the contracts with customers have payment terms that exceed \none year\n; therefore, the Company elected to apply the significant financing component practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.\n88\nTable of Contents\nRegulated Businesses Revenue\nRevenue from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. Revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.\nThe Company recognizes revenues for certain ratemaking mechanisms that meet the criteria for alternative revenue program accounting. These mechanisms, which include the Company’s revenue stability mechanisms, qualify as alternative revenue programs if they have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery and are expected to be collected within \n24\n months following the end of the period in which they were recognized. For mechanisms that meet these criteria, the Company adjusts revenue and records an offsetting regulatory asset or liability once the condition or event allowing additional billing or refund has occurred. See Note 4—Revenue Recognition for disaggregated revenue information.\nOther Revenue\nThe Company has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on military installations and facilities owned by municipal customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues or other long-term assets, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current or long-term liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined.\n See Note 4—Revenue Recognition for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for U.S. tax purposes. Members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.\nCertain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements. These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. In addition, the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.\nInvestment tax credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives of the related assets.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities on a net basis.\n See Note 14—Income Taxes for additional information.\n89\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction\nAFUDC is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity funds devoted to plant under construction. The regulated utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is shown as a reduction of interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equity funds would be included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \nPresented in the table below is AFUDC for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAllowance for other funds used during construction\n$\n38\n \n$\n41\n \n$\n20\n \nAllowance for borrowed funds used during construction\n21\n \n24\n \n14\n \nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.\nAll derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge).\nThe gains and losses on the effective portion of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. Any ineffective portion of designated cash-flow hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.\nCash flows from derivative contracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n See Note 11—Long-Term Debt for additional information.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe Company maintains defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees and retirees. The plan obligation and costs of providing benefits under these plans are annually measured as of December 31. The measurement involves various factors, assumptions and accounting elections. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Cumulative gains and losses that are in excess of \n10\n% of the greater of either the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining future service period of the current active membership for the plans, with the exception of the American Water Pension Plan for Certain Inactive Participants, which is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. See Note 15—Employee Benefits for additional information.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize curtailments when the total expected future service of plan participants is reduced by greater than \n10\n% due to an event that results in terminations and/or retirements.\nNew Accounting Standards\nPresented in the table below are new accounting standards that were adopted by the Company in 2024:\nStandard\nDescription\nDate of Adoption\nApplication\nEffect on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSegment Reporting\nThe guidance in this standard expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. Additionally, the guidance enhances interim disclosure requirements, clarifies circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit and loss, provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and other disclosure requirements.\nFiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024\nRetrospective\nThe Company adopted the standard as of December 31, 2024, including a recast of 2023 and 2022 information, by including additional required disclosures within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 20—Segment Information for further details.\n90\nTable of Contents\nPresented in the table below are recently issued accounting standards that have not yet been adopted by the Company as of December 31, 2024:\nStandard\nDescription\nDate of Adoption\nApplication\nEffect on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nIncome Taxes\nThe guidance in this standard requires disclosure of a tax rate reconciliation table, in both percentages and reporting currency amounts, which includes additional categories of information about federal, state, and foreign income taxes and provides further details about reconciling items in certain categories that meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance also requires an annual disclosure of income taxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes paid, and further disaggregated by jurisdiction based on a quantitative threshold. The standard includes other disclosure requirements and eliminates certain existing disclosure requirements.\nAnnual periods beginning after December 15, 2024\nProspective, with retrospective application also permitted\nThe Company is evaluating the impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and the timing of adoption.\nIncome Statement Disaggregation\nThe guidance in this standard enhances disclosures related to income statement expenses to further disaggregate expenses in the footnotes to the financial statements. The standard requires disaggregation of any relevant expense caption presented on the face of the income statement that contains the following expense categories: purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depletion.

The guidance requires an entity to account for a settlement as an induced conversion if the inducement offer includes the issuance of all of the consideration issuable under the conversion privileges provided in the terms of the existing convertible debt instrument. \nAnnual periods beginning after December 15, 2025 and interim reporting period within those annual reporting periods\nProspective, with retrospective application also permitted.\nThe Company is evaluating the impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and the timing of adoption.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to conform to the current presentation.\nNote 3: Regulatory Matters\nGeneral Rate Cases\nThe table below summarizes the annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from general rate case authorizations that became effective during 2024. The amounts include reductions for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”) that are generally offset in income tax expense.\nEffective Date\nAmount\nGeneral rate cases by state:\nKentucky\n(a)\n$\n17\n \nNew Jersey\nSeptember 15, 2024\n80\n \nPennsylvania\nAugust 7, 2024\n99\n \nIndiana, Step Increases\n(b)\n48\n \nWest Virginia\nFebruary 25, 2024\n18\n \nCalifornia\nJanuary 1, 2024\n21\n \nTotal general rate case authorizations\n$\n283\n \n(a)\nIn 2024, $\n6\n million was effective November 6 and $\n11\n million was effective May 3.\n(b)\nIn 2024, $\n23\n million was effective May 10 and $\n25\n million was effective February 21.\n91\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from general rate case authorizations that became effective on or after January 1, 2025. The amounts include reductions for the amortization of EADIT that are generally offset in income tax expense.\nEffective Date\nAmount\nGeneral rate cases by state:\nTennessee\nJanuary 21, 2025\n$\n1\n \nIllinois\nJanuary 1, 2025\n105\n \nTotal general rate case authorizations\n$\n106\n \nOn January 21, 2025, the Tennessee Public Utility Commission (the “TPUC”) approved a motion authorizing an adjustment of water base rates requested in a rate case filed on May 1, 2024, by the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary. The TPUC approved an increase of $\n1\n million in annualized revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $\n18\n million, based on an authorized return on equity of \n9.70\n%, authorized rate base of approximately $\n300\n million, a common equity ratio of \n44.19\n% and a debt ratio of \n55.81\n%. This adjustment took effect on January 21, 2025, and is driven primarily by approximately $\n173\n million in capital investments made and to be made by the Tennessee subsidiary through December 2025.\nOn December 5, 2024, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a final order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case originally filed on January 25, 2024, by the Company’s Illinois subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an increase of $\n105\n million in annualized water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $\n5\n million, based on an authorized return on equity of \n9.84\n%, authorized rate base of $\n2.2\n billion, and a capital structure with an equity component of \n49.00\n% and a debt component of \n51.00\n%. The general rate case order denied the second step increase of $\n16\n million. The increase was effective January 1, 2025, and is driven primarily by approximately $\n557\n million in capital investments made and to be made by the Illinois subsidiary from January 2024 through December 2025.\nOn December 5, 2024, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) approved a final decision adopting the terms of a partial settlement agreement filed on November 17, 2023, in the Company’s California subsidiary’s general rate case originally filed on July 1, 2022. Incorporating the currently effective return on equity of \n10.20\n%, the decision provides incremental annualized water and wastewater revenues of $\n21\n million in the 2024 test year, and an estimated $\n16\n million in the 2025 escalation year and $\n16\n million in the 2026 attrition year. New rates were implemented retroactively to January 1, 2024. In addition, the CPUC denied the California subsidiary’s proposed Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism but approved continuation of its currently effective Annual Consumption Adjustment Mechanism. On December 12, 2024, the California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the CPUC’s denial of the proposed Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism.\nOn May 3, 2024, the Kentucky Public Service Commission (the “KPSC”) issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on June 30, 2023, by the Company’s Kentucky subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an $\n11\n million annualized increase in water revenues, excluding infrastructure surcharge revenues of $\n10\n million, which continue to be recovered in the Kentucky subsidiary’s approved infrastructure mechanism. The annualized increase is based upon an authorized return on equity of \n9.70\n%, authorized rate base of $\n489\n million, which reflects capital investments through January 31, 2025, and a capital structure with a common equity ratio of \n52.22\n%. Interim rates in this proceeding were effective on February 6, 2024, and the order required that the difference between interim and final approved rates be subject to refund no later than August 26, 2024. On May 16, 2024, the Kentucky subsidiary filed with the KPSC a petition for rehearing of the KPSC’s order, seeking clarification and/or correction of certain computational inconsistencies that the Kentucky subsidiary believes are reflected in the KPSC’s order with respect to the authorized amount of annualized revenues to be received by the Kentucky subsidiary. On November 6, 2024, the KPSC approved a final order (the “Final Order”) providing for a $\n17\n million annualized increase in water revenues, an increase of approximately $\n6\n million from May 3, 2024. New rates provided in the Final Order were effective November 6, 2024.\nOn September 4, 2024, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (“NJBPU”) issued an order approving without modification the stipulation of settlement of a general rate case filed on January 19, 2024, by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an $\n80\n million annualized increase in the New Jersey subsidiary’s water and wastewater revenues, effective September 15, 2024, based on (i) an authorized return on equity of \n9.60\n%, (ii) an authorized rate base of $\n5.1\n billion, (iii) a common equity ratio of \n55.00\n%, and (iv) a long-term debt ratio of \n45.00\n%. The annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by $\n1.3\n billion of incremental capital investments since the New Jersey subsidiary’s last general rate case. The New Jersey subsidiary will continue to defer as a regulatory asset or liability, as appropriate, until its next general rate case, the difference between its pension expense and other postretirement benefits expense and those amounts included in base rates.\n92\nTable of Contents\nOn July 22, 2024, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the “PaPUC”) released an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a general rate case filed by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary on November 8, 2023. The PaPUC approved a $\n99\n million annualized increase in the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $\n20\n million, based on (i) an authorized return on equity of \n9.45\n%, (ii) an authorized rate base of $\n5.8\n billion, which reflects, as requested and included in the general rate case, approximately $\n1.0\n billion in capital investments to be made through mid-2025, (iii) a common equity ratio of \n55.30\n%, and (iv) a long-term debt ratio of \n44.70\n%. Certain acquisitions, including the acquisition of the wastewater collection and treatment system of the Butler Area Sewer Authority, were excluded from authorized base rates. The new rates were effective on August 7, 2024, except that new wastewater rates for \ntwo\n recently acquired systems, including the City of York, will take effect during the first half of 2025 in accordance with the terms of the relevant acquisition agreements. As part of its approval of this rate adjustment, the PaPUC initiated an investigation into certain reported water service and water quality issues in the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s Northeastern service territory, which reports had been provided during public input hearings convened in the general rate case. The PaPUC is expected to conclude the investigation in the second quarter of 2025.\nOn February 23, 2024, the West Virginia Public Service Commission (the “WVPSC”) issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on May 1, 2023, by the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an $\n18\n million annualized increase in water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $\n7\n million, based on an authorized return on equity of \n9.80\n%, authorized rate base of $\n886\n million, which reflects capital investments through February 2024, a common equity ratio of \n50.12\n% and a long-term debt ratio of \n49.88\n%. The increased water and wastewater revenues related to the base rate adjustment are being driven primarily by (i) $\n220\n million of related water and wastewater system capital investments made since the completion of the West Virginia subsidiary’s previous rate case, (ii) higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and (iii) increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs.\nOn February 14, 2024, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on March 31, 2023, by the Company’s Indiana subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $\n66\n million annualized increase in water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges, based on an authorized return on equity of \n9.65\n%, authorized rate base of $\n1.8\n billion, a common equity ratio of \n56.15\n% and a debt ratio of \n43.85\n%. For purposes of determining rates, the adjustment is based on an equity component of \n48.19\n% due to the regulatory practice in Indiana of including certain zero-cost items or tax credit balances in the capital structure calculation. The annualized revenue increase will include three step increases, with $\n25\n million of the increase to be included in rates in February 2024, $\n23\n million in May 2024, and $\n18\n million in May 2025. The increases are being driven primarily by (i) over $\n875\n million of water and wastewater system capital investments since the completion of the Indiana subsidiary’s last rate case and through April 30, 2025, (ii) higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and (iii) increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs.\nPending General Rate Case Filings\nOn August 2, 2024, the Company’s Hawaii subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $\n2\n million in annualized incremental revenues, which is based on a proposed return on equity of \n10.67\n% and a capital structure with an equity component of \n52.11\n% and debt component of \n47.89\n%. The requested annualized incremental revenue is driven primarily by approximately $\n41\n million in capital investments made and to be made by the Hawaii subsidiary through 2025. The Hawaii subsidiary anticipates that the general rate case proceeding will be completed by mid-2025.\nOn July 1, 2024, the Company’s Missouri subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $\n148\n million in annualized incremental revenues. The request is based on a return on equity of \n10.75\n% and a capital structure with an equity component of \n50.54\n% and a long-term debt component of \n49.46\n%. The requested annualized incremental revenue is driven primarily by $\n1.5\n billion of incremental capital investments completed and planned by the Missouri subsidiary from January 2023 through May 2026. On July 31, 2024, the Missouri Public Service Commission issued an order establishing the test year in this case, which modified the Missouri subsidiary’s original proposal for a future test year through May 2026, and instead reverted to a true-up period through December 31, 2024, with an allowance for proposed discrete adjustments subsequent to this date. On September 6, 2024, the Missouri subsidiary filed supplemental testimony to revise the request to approximately $\n123\n million in annualized incremental revenues and define the specific discrete adjustments proposed through the rate effective period, which lowered the incremental capital investments completed and planned to $\n1.1\n billion through May 2025. The Missouri subsidiary anticipates that the general rate case proceeding will be completed by mid-2025.\n93\nTable of Contents\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company’s Iowa subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $\n21\n million in additional annualized revenues, which is based on a proposed return on equity of \n10.75\n% and a capital structure with an equity component of \n52.57\n% and debt component of \n47.43\n%. The requested annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by approximately $\n157\n million in capital investments made and to be made by the Iowa subsidiary through March 2026. Interim rates became effective May 11, 2024, with the difference between interim and final approved rates subject to refund. On August 29, 2024, the Iowa subsidiary submitted supplemental testimony consistent with the procedural schedule, which was subsequently challenged by the parties in the proceeding. On October 4, 2024, the Iowa Utilities Commission issued an order that granted the inclusion of the supplemental filing and extended the procedural schedule in the case beyond the statutory ten-month period. The Iowa subsidiary now expects resolution of this proceeding by May 2025.\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company’s California subsidiary submitted a request to delay by \none year\n its cost of capital filing and maintain its current authorized cost of capital through 2025. On February 2, 2024, the CPUC granted the request for a \none-year\n extension of the cost of capital filing to May 1, 2025, to set its authorized cost of capital beginning January 1, 2026. On December 18, 2024, the California subsidiary submitted a request to further delay by \none year\n its cost of capital filing and maintain the authorized cost of capital through 2026. On January 14, 2025, the CPUC granted the request for a \none-year\n extension of the cost of capital filing to May 1, 2026, to set its authorized cost of capital beginning January 1, 2027.\nOn November 1, 2023, the Company’s Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $\n20\n million in additional annualized revenues. The request is based on a proposed return on equity of \n10.95\n% and a capital structure with an equity component of \n45.67\n% and a debt and other component of \n54.33\n%. The requested increase is driven by approximately $\n110\n million in capital investments between May 2023 and April 2025. The request also proposed a revenue decoupling mechanism and seeks deferral of certain production cost adjustments. Interim rates became effective May 1, 2024, with the difference between interim and final approved rates subject to refund. On September 20, 2024, the Virginia subsidiary filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “SCC”) a “black box” stipulation of settlement on key financial terms which agreed to a $\n15\n million annualized increase in the Virginia subsidiary’s revenues. The stipulation of settlement also agreed, solely for purposes of the Virginia subsidiary’s future filings requiring a stated cost of capital and/or capital structure (including its annual information and water and wastewater infrastructure surcharge filings), that its return on equity will be \n9.70\n% and its capital structure will consist of an equity component of \n45.67\n% and a debt and other component of \n54.33\n%. The stipulation of settlement remains subject to SCC review and approval.\nInfrastructure Surcharges\nA number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. \nPresented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective during 2024:\nEffective Date\nAmount\nInfrastructure surcharges by state:\nMissouri\n(b)\n$\n47\n \nPennsylvania\n(c)\n21\n \nNew Jersey\nApril 30, 2024\n9\n \nIowa\nMarch 1, 2024\n1\n \nWest Virginia (a)\nMarch 1, 2024\n7\n \nIllinois\nJanuary 1, 2024\n5\n \nTotal infrastructure surcharge authorizations\n$\n90\n \n(a)\nOn March 5, 2024, the WVPSC directed the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary to interpret the distribution system improvement charge (“DSIC”) Order as having included within the DSIC the \nthree-year\n amortization of a prior authorized deferral associated with a large treatment plant project. The inclusion of this deferral increased the net incremental revenue by $\n0.7\n million to a total of $\n6.6\n million effective March 1, 2024.\n(b)\nIn 2024, $\n21\n million was effective July 11 and $\n26\n million was effective January 20.\n(c)\nIn 2024, $\n14\n million was effective July 1 and $\n7\n million was effective April 1.\n94\nTable of Contents\nPresented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective on or after January 1, 2025:\nEffective Date\nAmount\nInfrastructure surcharge filings by state:\nMissouri\nFebruary 7, 2025\n$\n17\n \nKentucky\nJanuary 1, 2025\n2\n \nWest Virginia\nJanuary 1, 2025\n4\n \nTotal infrastructure surcharge filings\n$\n23\n \nOther Regulatory Matters\nIn September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that required the Company’s California subsidiary to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would have become effective upon receiving an order in the rate case. On October 5, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the decision and following the CPUC’s denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review with the California Supreme Court on October 27, 2021. On May 18, 2022, the California Supreme Court issued a writ of review for the California subsidiary’s petition and the petitions filed by other entities challenging the decision. On July 8, 2024, the California Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion concluding that the CPUC did not regularly seek to exercise its authority when it prohibited water utilities from proposing to continue their water revenue adjustment mechanisms. Accordingly, the California Supreme Court vacated the portion of the CPUC’s 2020 decision relating to this prohibition against continuation of such water revenue adjustment mechanisms.\nIndependent of the judicial challenge, California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporation’s revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022, and became effective on January 1, 2023. In response to the legislation, on January 27, 2023, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an updated application requesting the CPUC to consider a Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism in its 2022 general rate case. On December 5, 2024, the CPUC denied the California subsidiary’s proposed Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism but approved continuation of its currently effective Annual Consumption Adjustment Mechanism. On December 12, 2024, the California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the CPUC’s denial of the proposed Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism.\nOn March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the NJBPU that recommended denial of a petition filed by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $\n29\n million associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfield’s water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJ’s initial decision without modification. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. On December 30, 2024, the New Jersey Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the NJBPU decision rejecting the acquisition adjustments. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the NJBPU’s order and resulting appeal decision, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n95\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Assets\nRegulatory assets represent costs that are probable of recovery from customers in future rates. Approximately \n50\n% of the Company’s total regulatory asset balance at December 31, 2024, earns a return. \nPresented in the table below is the composition of regulatory assets as of December 31:\n2024\n2023\nRemoval costs recoverable through rates\n$\n356\n \n$\n322\n \nDeferred pension expense\n318\n \n308\n \nCustomer lead line replacements\n86\n \n66\n \nUnamortized debt expense\n84\n \n82\n \nRegulatory balancing accounts\n71\n \n81\n \nProgrammed maintenance expense\n57\n \n58\n \nPurchase premium recoverable through rates\n50\n \n52\n \nOther\n128\n \n137\n \nTotal regulatory assets\n$\n1,150\n \n$\n1,106\n \nRemoval costs recoverable through rates represent costs incurred for removal of property, plant and equipment or other retirement costs.\nThe Company’s deferred pension expense includes a portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods of $\n304\n million and $\n300\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining portion is the pension expense in excess of authorized amounts which is deferred by certain subsidiaries and probable of recovery in future service rates.\nCustomer lead line replacements are the costs incurred to replace customer owned lead service lines. Costs are recovered through a customer’s surcharge or through base rates, depending on the jurisdiction.\nUnamortized debt expense is amortized over the lives of the respective issues. Call premiums on the redemption of long-term debt, as well as unamortized debt issuance costs, are deferred and amortized to the extent they will be recovered through future service rates.\nProgrammed maintenance expense are costs incurred to inspect or paint water tanks and are amortized on a straight line basis over a period determined by each state regulator.\nPurchase premiums recoverable through rates are being recovered over periods up to \n40\n years.\nRegulatory balancing accounts accumulate differences between revenues recognized and authorized revenue requirements until they are collected from customers or are refunded. Regulatory balancing accounts include low income programs, purchased power and water accounts, dam removal costs and other cost balancing mechanisms. \nOther regulatory assets include the financial impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain construction costs for treatment facilities, property tax stabilization, employee-related costs, business services project expenses, coastal water project costs, rate case expenditures and environmental remediation costs among others. These costs are deferred because the amounts are being recovered in rates or are probable of recovery through rates in future periods.\nThe Company has current regulatory assets of $\n19\n million and $\n13\n million included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n96\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Liabilities\nRegulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers through the rate making process. Also, if costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Company records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities. \nPresented in the table below is the composition of regulatory liabilities as of December 31:\n2024\n2023\nIncome taxes recovered through rates\n$\n1,016\n \n$\n1,064\n \nRemoval costs recovered through rates\n245\n \n254\n \nPostretirement benefit liability\n71\n \n85\n \nOther\n84\n \n78\n \nTotal regulatory liabilities\n$\n1,416\n \n$\n1,481\n \nIncome taxes recovered through rates relate to deferred taxes that will be refunded to the Company’s customers. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”) required a re-measurement of the Company’s deferred income taxes. The portion of this re-measurement related to the Regulated Businesses was substantially offset by a regulatory liability as EADIT which will be used to benefit its regulated customers in future rates. All of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are amortizing EADIT and crediting customers.\nRemoval costs recovered through rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful lives that are recovered through customer rates over the lives of the associated assets.\nPostretirement benefit liability includes a portion of the over-funded status that is probable of refund through rates in future periods. The remaining portion represents prior service credits resulting from announced plan amendments which changed benefits for certain union and non-union plan participants.\nOther regulatory liabilities include the financial impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, TCJA reserves on revenue, pension and other postretirement benefit balancing accounts, legal settlement proceeds, deferred gains, refunds to customers related to tax overpayments, and various regulatory balancing accounts.\nThe Company has \nno\n current regulatory liabilities and had $\n1\n million of current regulatory liabilities included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n97\nTable of Contents\nNote 4: Revenue Recognition\nDisaggregated Revenues\nPresented in the table below are operating revenues disaggregated for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nOther Revenues Not from Contracts with Customers (a)\nTotal Operating Revenues\nRegulated Businesses:\nWater services:\n \nResidential\n$\n2,344\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n2,349\n \nCommercial\n881\n \n4\n \n885\n \nFire service\n164\n \n— \n164\n \nIndustrial\n182\n \n2\n \n184\n \nPublic and other\n291\n \n— \n291\n \nTotal water services\n3,862\n \n11\n \n3,873\n \nWastewater services:\n \nResidential\n243\n \n2\n \n245\n \nCommercial\n70\n \n— \n70\n \nIndustrial\n12\n \n— \n12\n \nPublic and other\n36\n \n— \n36\n \nTotal wastewater services\n361\n \n2\n \n363\n \nMiscellaneous utility charges\n42\n \n— \n42\n \nAlternative revenue programs\n— \n10\n \n10\n \nLease contract revenue\n— \n8\n \n8\n \nTotal Regulated Businesses\n4,265\n \n31\n \n4,296\n \nOther\n388\n \n—\n \n388\n \nTotal operating revenues\n$\n4,653\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n4,684\n \n(a)\nIncludes revenues associated with provisional rates, alternative revenue programs, lease contracts and intercompany rent, which are outside the scope of ASC 606, and accounted for under other existing GAAP.\n98\nTable of Contents\nPresented in the table below are operating revenues disaggregated for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nOther Revenues Not from Contracts with Customers (a)\nTotal Operating Revenues\nRegulated Businesses:\nWater services:\n \nResidential\n$\n2,143\n \n$\n— \n$\n2,143\n \nCommercial\n798\n \n— \n798\n \nFire service\n158\n \n— \n158\n \nIndustrial\n167\n \n— \n167\n \nPublic and other\n274\n \n— \n274\n \nTotal water services\n3,540\n \n— \n3,540\n \nWastewater services:\nResidential\n228\n \n— \n228\n \nCommercial\n62\n \n— \n62\n \nIndustrial\n8\n \n— \n8\n \nPublic and other\n29\n \n— \n29\n \nTotal wastewater services\n327\n \n— \n327\n \nMiscellaneous utility charges\n35\n \n— \n35\n \nAlternative revenue programs\n— \n10\n \n10\n \nLease contract revenue\n— \n8\n \n8\n \nTotal Regulated Businesses\n3,902\n \n18\n \n3,920\n \nOther\n315\n \n(\n1\n)\n314\n \nTotal operating revenues\n$\n4,217\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n4,234\n \n(a)\nIncludes revenues associated with alternative revenue programs, lease contracts and intercompany rent, which are outside the scope of ASC 606, and accounted for under other existing GAAP.\n99\nTable of Contents\nPresented in the table below are operating revenues disaggregated for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nOther Revenues Not from Contracts with Customers (a)\nTotal Operating Revenues\nRegulated Businesses:\nWater services:\n \nResidential\n$\n1,938\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n1,941\n \nCommercial\n709\n \n1\n \n710\n \nFire service\n147\n \n— \n147\n \nIndustrial\n152\n \n1\n \n153\n \nPublic and other\n252\n \n— \n252\n \nTotal water services\n3,198\n \n5\n \n3,203\n \nWastewater services:\nResidential\n173\n \n1\n \n174\n \nCommercial\n45\n \n— \n45\n \nIndustrial\n4\n \n— \n4\n \nPublic and other\n19\n \n— \n19\n \nTotal wastewater services\n241\n \n1\n \n242\n \nMiscellaneous utility charges\n36\n \n— \n36\n \nAlternative revenue programs\n— \n15\n \n15\n \nLease contract revenue\n— \n9\n \n9\n \nTotal Regulated Businesses\n3,475\n \n30\n \n3,505\n \nOther\n288\n \n(\n1\n)\n287\n \nTotal operating revenues\n$\n3,763\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n3,792\n \n(a)\nIncludes revenues associated with alternative provisional rates, revenue programs, lease contracts and intercompany rent, which are outside the scope of ASC 606, and accounted for under other existing GAAP.\nContract Balances\nContract assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. In MSG, certain contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Contract assets are recorded when billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition and are reclassified to accounts receivable when billed and the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities are recorded when the Company receives advances from customers prior to satisfying contractual performance obligations, particularly for construction contracts, and are recognized as revenue when the associated performance obligations are satisfied.\nContract assets of $\n84\n million, $\n95\n million and $\n86\n million are included in unbilled revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Also, contract assets of $\n39\n million are included in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, and there were \nno\n contract assets in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. There were $\n114\n million of contract assets added during 2024, and $\n86\n million of contract assets were transferred to accounts receivable during 2024. There were $\n87\n million of contract assets added during 2023, and $\n78\n million of contract assets were transferred to accounts receivable during 2023.\nContract liabilities of $\n40\n million, $\n63\n million and $\n91\n million are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Also, contract liabilities of $\n14\n million are included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, and there were \nno\n contract liabilities in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. There were $\n83\n million of contract liabilities added during 2024, and $\n92\n million of contract liabilities were recognized as revenue during 2024. There were $\n103\n million of contract liabilities added during 2023, and $\n131\n million of contract liabilities were recognized as revenue during 2023.\n100\nTable of Contents\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations (“RPOs”) represent revenues the Company expects to recognize in the future from contracts that are in progress. The Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s O&M and capital improvement contracts have RPOs. Contracts with the U.S. government for work on military installations expire between 2051 and 2073 and have RPOs of $\n7.4\n billion as of December 31, 2024, as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Such contracts are subject to customary termination provisions held by the U.S. government, prior to the agreed-upon contract expiration. Contracts with municipalities and commercial customers expire between 2026 and 2038 and have RPOs of $\n612\n million as of December 31, 2024, as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue.\nNote 5: Acquisitions and Divestitures\nRegulated Businesses\nDuring 2024, the Company closed on \n13\n acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems\n for a total aggregate purchase price of $\n417\n million, of which $\n415\n million was funded in \n2024\n, and which acquisitions added approximately \n69,500\n water and wastewater customers. These totals include the acquisitions from the Butler Area Sewer Authority and Granite City noted below. Assets acquired from all 2024 acquisitions, principally utility plant, totaled $\n426\n million and liabilities assumed totaled $\n10\n million. \nSeven\n of these acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. The preliminary purchase price allocations related to acquisitions accounted for as business combinations will be finalized once the valuation of assets acquired has been completed, no later than one year after their respective acquisition date.\nOn October 29, 2024, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary acquired the wastewater collection and treatment system assets from the Butler Area Sewer Authority for a purchase price of $\n230\n million, in cash. This system provides wastewater service for approximately \n15,000\n customer connections. Assets acquired from this acquisition, principally utility plant, totaled $\n229\n million and $\n1\n million of goodwill. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.\nOn March 11, 2024, the Company’s Illinois subsidiary completed the acquisition of a wastewater treatment plant and related assets from Granite City for a cash purchase price of $\n86\n million, which added approximately \n26,000\n wastewater customers, including 15,500 customers indirectly in surrounding communities. Assets acquired from this acquisition, principally utility plant, totaled $\n91\n million and liabilities assumed totaled $\n5\n million. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.\nDuring \n2023\n, the Company closed on \n23\n acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of\n $\n77\n million, $\n2\n million\n of which was funded as a deposit in 2021,\n and which acquisitions added approximately \n18,100\n water and wastewater customers. Assets acquired from these acquisitions, principally utility plant, totaled $\n81\n million and liabilities assumed totaled $\n4\n million. \nFive\n of these acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations.\nThe pro forma impact of the Company’s acquisitions was not material to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nSale of Homeowner Services Group \nOn December 9, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the Company sold all of the equity interests in subsidiaries that comprised HOS to a wholly owned subsidiary (the “Buyer”) of funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, a global private equity advisory firm, for total consideration of approximately $\n1.275\n billion. The consideration at closing was comprised of $\n480\n million in cash, a secured seller note payable in cash and issued by the Buyer in the principal amount of $\n720\n million, with an interest rate of \n7.00\n% per year, and a contingent cash payment of $\n75\n million payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023. \n101\nTable of Contents\nOn February 2, 2024, this note was amended to increase the principal amount from $\n720\n million to $\n795\n million, in full satisfaction of the $\n75\n million contingent cash payment payable under the HOS sale agreement. In addition, the interest rate payable on the secured seller note has increased from \n7.00\n% per year to \n10.00\n% per year until maturity. The Company recognized $\n77\n million, $\n50\n million, and $\n50\n million of interest income during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from this note. The secured seller note requires compliance with affirmative and negative covenants (subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions), including a covenant limiting the incurrence by the Buyer and certain affiliates of additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds, but does not include any financial maintenance covenants. Certain of these covenants were amended, including to provide for annual reductions of specified debt incurrence ratios. Furthermore, the amendment to the secured seller note eliminated the conditional right, beginning December 9, 2024, to require a repayment, without premium or penalty, of \n100\n% of the outstanding principal amount in full in cash together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other obligations thereunder. The final maturity date of the secured seller note remains December 9, 2026. The repayment obligations of the Buyer under this note are secured by a first priority security interest in certain property of the Buyer and the former HOS subsidiaries, including their cash and securities accounts, as well as a pledge of the equity interests in each of those subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. \nOn December 3, 2024, a covenant in the secured seller note was amended to increase the maximum aggregate principal amount of revolving facility indebtedness (as defined and described thereunder) that could be incurred at any time by the Buyer and certain affiliates. \nThe secured seller note may not be prepaid at the Buyer’s election (except in certain limited circumstances) before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. If the Buyer seeks to repay the secured seller note in breach of this non-call provision, an event of default will occur under the secured seller note and the Company may, among other actions, demand repayment in full together with a premium ranging from \n105.5\n% to \n107.5\n% of the outstanding principal amount of the loan and a customary “make-whole” payment.\nNote 6: Property, Plant and Equipment \nPresented in the table below are the major classes of property, plant and equipment by category as of December 31:\n2024\n2023\nRange of Remaining Useful Lives\nWeighted Average Useful Life\nUtility plant:\n \n \n \n \nLand and other non-depreciable assets\n$\n302\n \n$\n293\n \n \n \nSources of supply\n1,124\n \n1,081\n \n20\n to \n127\n years\n46\n years\nTreatment and pumping\n4,786\n \n4,594\n \n3\n to \n101\n years\n39\n years\nTransmission and distribution\n14,745\n \n13,900\n \n9\n to \n128\n years\n66\n years\nServices, meters and fire hydrants\n6,356\n \n5,696\n \n2\n to \n109\n years\n29\n years\nGeneral structures and equipment\n2,813\n \n2,512\n \n3\n to \n109\n years\n17\n years\nWaste collection\n1,986\n \n1,719\n \n5\n to \n113\n years\n53\n years\nWaste treatment, pumping and disposal\n1,425\n \n1,191\n \n2\n to \n153\n years\n34\n years\nConstruction work in progress\n1,359\n \n1,040\n \n \n \nOther plant\n22\n \n24\n \nTotal utility plant\n34,918\n \n32,050\n \n \n \nNonutility property\n141\n \n139\n \n3\n to \n50\n years\n12\n years\nTotal property, plant and equipment\n$\n35,059\n \n$\n32,189\n \n \n \nProperty, plant and equipment depreciation expense amounted to $\n690\n million\n,\n $\n617\n million and $\n552\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was included in depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The provision for depreciation expressed as a percentage of the aggregate average depreciable asset balances was \n2.73\n%, \n2.68\n% and \n2.60\n% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, the Company had capital expenditures acquired on account but unpaid of $\n347\n million and $\n399\n million included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIn connection with the Company’s capital investment in its corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (“NJEDA”) determined that the Company was qualified to receive $\n161\n million in tax credits over a \n10-year\n period commencing in 2019.\n102\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is required to meet various annual requirements, including the maintenance of qualified full-time positions at the qualified business facility, in order to monetize one-tenth of the tax credits annually and is subject to a claw-back period if the Company does not meet certain NJEDA requirements of the tax credit program in years 11 through 15.\nIn December and January of 2024, the NJEDA issued to the Company the utilization certificates for the 2022 and 2021 tax credits in the amount of $\n15\n million and $\n16\n million, respectively. In March of 2023, the NJEDA issued to the Company the utilization certificate for the 2020 tax credits in the amount of $\n16\n million. The Company sold the 2022, 2021, and 2020 tax credits to an external party for $\n14\n million, $\n15\n million and $\n15\n million, respectively. F\nor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded losses of\n $\n2\n million, $\n1\n million and $\n1\n million\n, respectively, to \nOther income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from the sale of tax credits. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had \nno\n current assets and $\n90\n million of long-term assets included in Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the 2023 through 2028 tax credits. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had current assets of $\n32\n million included in Other and $\n90\n million of long-term assets included in Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the 2021 through 2028 tax credits. In 2023, the Company reduced net realizable value of the future tax credit receivable by approximately $\n7\n million as the Company does not expect it will be eligible to recognize the full amount of the tax credit as it expects to have lower than required eligible headcount in the future. The Company has made the necessary annual filing for the year ended December 31, 2023, and expects to make the 2024 filing in April 2025, prior to the required filing deadline. The submitted filings are under review by the NJEDA and it is expected that the Company will receive final NJEDA approval and monetize the 2023 tax credits in 2026.\nNote 7: Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nPresented in the table below are the changes in the allowances for uncollectible accounts for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance as of January 1\n$\n(\n51\n)\n$\n(\n60\n)\n$\n(\n75\n)\nAmounts charged to expense\n(\n31\n)\n(\n24\n)\n(\n24\n)\nAmounts written off\n31\n \n28\n \n27\n \nOther, net (a)\n(\n2\n)\n5\n \n12\n \nBalance as of December 31\n$\n(\n53\n)\n$\n(\n51\n)\n$\n(\n60\n)\n(a)\nThis portion of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is primarily related to COVID-19 related regulatory asset activity.\nNote 8: Goodwill \nGoodwill\nPresented in the table below are the changes in the carrying value of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n \nRegulated Businesses\nOther\nConsolidated\nCost\nAccumulated Impairment\nCost\nAccumulated Impairment\nCost\nAccumulated Impairment\nTotal Net\nBalance as of January 1, 2023\n$\n3,470\n \n$\n(\n2,332\n)\n$\n113\n \n$\n(\n108\n)\n$\n3,583\n \n$\n(\n2,440\n)\n$\n1,143\n \nGoodwill from acquisitions\n—\n \n— \n—\n \n— \n—\n \n— \n—\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n3,470\n \n$\n(\n2,332\n)\n$\n113\n \n$\n(\n108\n)\n$\n3,583\n \n$\n(\n2,440\n)\n$\n1,143\n \nGoodwill from acquisitions\n1\n \n— \n—\n \n— \n1\n \n— \n1\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n3,471\n \n$\n(\n2,332\n)\n$\n113\n \n$\n(\n108\n)\n$\n3,584\n \n$\n(\n2,440\n)\n$\n1,144\n \nThe Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of November 30, 2024, which included qualitative assessments of its Regulated Businesses and MSG reporting units. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that there were no factors present that would indicate that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their respective carrying values as of November 30, 2024.\nIn 2024, the Company acquired goodwill of $\n1\n million associated with \none\n of its acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses segment. In 2023, there were \nno\n additions or impairments to the Company’s goodwill.\n103\nTable of Contents\nNote 9: Shareholders\n’\n Equity\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn March 3, 2023, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of \n12,650,000\n shares of parent company common stock. Upon closing of this offering, the Company received, after deduction of the underwriting discount and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $\n1,688\n million. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to repay short-term commercial paper obligations of American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, and for general corporate purposes.\nDividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Company’s dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the “DRIP”), shareholders may reinvest cash common stock dividends and purchase additional shares of Company common stock, up to certain limits, through the plan administrator without paying brokerage commissions. Shares purchased by participants through the DRIP may be newly issued shares, treasury shares, or at the Company’s election, shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Purchases generally will be made and credited to DRIP accounts once each week. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately \n4.1\n million shares available for future issuance under the DRIP.\nAnti-dilutive Stock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program, which allows the Company to purchase up to \n10\n million shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time over an unrestricted period of time. The Company did \nno\nt repurchase shares of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 15—Employee Benefits for additional information.\nThe amortization of the gain (loss) on cash flow hedges is reclassified to net income during the period incurred and is included in Interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAn unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale fixed-income securities is reclassified to net income upon sale of the securities as a realized gain or loss and is included in Other, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDividends and Distributions\nThe Company’s Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is subject to having access to sufficient sources of liquidity, net income and cash flows of the Company’s subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and direct and indirect distributions from, and repayments of indebtedness of, the Company’s subsidiaries, compliance with Delaware corporate and other laws, compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements and other factors.\nThe Company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect the Company’s income and cash flows. When dividends on common stock are declared, they are typically paid in March, June, September and December. Historically, dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record as of a date less than 30 days prior to the distribution date. Since the dividends on the Company’s common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid $\n585\n million, $\n532\n million and $\n467\n million in cash dividends, respectively. Presented in the table below is the per share cash dividends paid for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDecember\n$\n0.7650\n \n$\n0.7075\n \n$\n0.6550\n \nSeptember\n$\n0.7650\n \n$\n0.7075\n \n$\n0.6550\n \nJune\n$\n0.7650\n \n$\n0.7075\n \n$\n0.6550\n \nMarch\n$\n0.7075\n \n$\n0.6550\n \n$\n0.6025\n \nOn December 6, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $\n0.7650\n per share payable on March 4, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2025.\nUnder applicable law, the Company’s subsidiaries may pay dividends on their capital stock or other equity only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the amount of the dividend that the subsidiary can pay. The ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends, make other upstream distributions or repay indebtedness to parent company or AWCC, as applicable, is subject to compliance with applicable corporate, tax and other laws, regulatory restrictions and financial and other contractual obligations, including, for example, (i) regulatory capital, surplus or net worth requirements, (ii) outstanding debt service obligations, (iii) requirements to make preferred and preference stock dividend payments, and (iv) other contractual agreements, covenants or obligations made or entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries.\nRegulatory Restrictions on Indebtedness\nThe issuance of long-term debt or equity securities by the Company or long-term debt by AWCC does not require authorization of any state PUC if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and parent company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide these borrowings to the Regulated Businesses or parent company. PUC authorization is generally required for the regulated subsidiaries to incur long-term debt. The Company’s regulated subsidiaries normally obtain these required PUC authorizations on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time, or, as necessary, in connection with a specific financing or refinancing of debt.\n105\nTable of Contents\nNote 10: Stock Based Compensation\nThe Company has granted stock units, stock awards and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and employees pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2017 Omnibus Plan”), approved by the Company’s shareholders in May 2017. Stock units under the 2017 Omnibus Plan generally vest based on (i) continued employment with the Company (“RSUs”), or (ii) continued employment with the Company where distribution of the shares is subject to the satisfaction in whole or in part of stated performance-based goals (“PSUs”). A total of \n7.2\n million shares of common stock may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2024, \n5.8\n million shares were available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The 2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants of awards may be in any of the following forms: incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents. Dividend equivalents may be granted only on stock units or other stock-based awards. The 2017 Omnibus Plan expires in 2027.\nThe Company had granted stock options, stock units, including RSUs and PSUs, and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and other key employees of the Company under its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). The 2007 Plan has been replaced by the 2017 Omnibus Plan, as defined above, and no additional awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan. However, shares may still be issued under the 2007 Plan pursuant to the terms of awards previously issued under that plan prior to May 12, 2017.\nThe cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards issued. The value of stock unit awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the requisite service period. All awards granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 are classified as equity. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards over the vesting period of the award. The Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimate employee forfeitures. The estimated rate is compared to the actual forfeitures at the end of the reporting period and adjusted as necessary. There have been no significant adjustments to the forfeiture rates during 2024, 2023 and 2022. There were no grants of stock options to employees after 2016, and there were no stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022. \nPresented in the table below is the stock-based compensation expense recorded in O&M expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRSUs and PSUs\n$\n34\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n26\n \nNonqualified employee stock purchase plan\n2\n \n2\n \n2\n \nStock-based compensation\n36\n \n25\n \n28\n \nIncome tax benefit\n(\n8\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n6\n)\nStock-based compensation expense, net of tax\n$\n28\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n22\n \nThere were \nno\n significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nSubject to limitations on deductibility imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award at the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company records the tax impacts related to compensation costs as deferred income tax assets. The tax deductions in excess of the deferred benefits recorded throughout the requisite service period are recorded to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are presented in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nStock Units\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted RSUs to certain employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. RSUs generally vest based on continued employment with the Company over periods ranging from \none\n to \nthree years\n. The RSUs are valued at the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and the majority vest ratably over a \nthree-year\n service period. These RSUs are amortized through expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted stock units to non-employee directors under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The stock units were vested in full on the date of grant. Prior to 2024, distribution of the shares was made within \n30\n days of the earlier of (i) \n15\n months after the date of the last annual meeting of shareholders, subject to any deferral election by the director, or (ii) the participant’s separation from service. Beginning in 2024, the shares are distributed within \n30\n days after the date of grant. Because these stock units vested on the grant date, the total grant date fair value was recorded in operation and maintenance expense on the grant date.\n106\nTable of Contents\nThe grant date fair value of RSUs granted to certain employees and stock units granted to non-employee directors totaled $\n10\n million, $\n9\n million and $\n9\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nPresented in the table below is RSU and director stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nShares (in thousands)\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (per share)\nNon-vested total as of December 31, 2023\n64\n \n$\n134.61\n \nGranted\n81\n \n123.07\n \nVested\n(\n59\n)\n148.13\n \nForfeited\n(\n11\n)\n140.79\n \nNon-vested total as of December 31, 2024\n75\n \n$\n131.20\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n5\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the non-vested RSUs is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining life of \n1.67\n years. The total fair value of stock units and RSUs vested was $\n9\n million, $\n6\n million and $\n6\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted PSUs to certain employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan with grant date fair values totaling $\n23\n million, $\n28\n million and $\n20\n million, respectively. The majority of PSUs\n \nvest ratably based on continued employment with the Company over the \nthree-year\n performance period (the “Performance Period”). Distribution of the performance shares is contingent upon the achievement of one or more internal performance measures and, separately, a relative total shareholder return performance measure, over the Performance Period.\nPresented in the table below is PSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nShares (in thousands)\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (per share)\nNon-vested total as of December 31, 2023\n245\n \n$\n143.26\n \nGranted\n177\n \n127.18\n \nVested\n(\n60\n)\n157.83\n \nForfeited\n(\n40\n)\n181.71\n \nNon-vested total as of December 31, 2024\n322\n \n$\n130.04\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n7\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the non-vested PSUs is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining life of \n0.83\n years. The total fair value of PSUs vested was $\n23\n million, $\n31\n million and $\n24\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nPSUs granted with one or more internal performance measures are valued at the market value of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. PSUs granted with a relative total shareholder return condition are valued, for accounting purposes, using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of traded common stock of the Company and comparative companies using daily stock prices over the past \nthree years\n. The expected term is \nthree years\n and the risk-free interest rate is based on the three-year U.S. Treasury rate in effect as of the measurement date. \nPresented in the table below are the weighted average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation and the weighted average grant date fair values of PSUs granted for the years ended December 31:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nExpected volatility\n22.98\n%\n25.45\n%\n29.69\n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.39\n%\n4.31\n%\n1.90\n%\nExpected life (years)\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\nGrant date fair value per share\n$\n118.95\n$\n168.00\n$\n99.23\nThe grant date fair value of PSUs that vest ratably and have market and/or performance conditions are amortized through expense over the requisite service period using the graded-vesting method.\n107\nTable of Contents\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) that expires in 2027 through which employee participants (which excludes certain of the Company’s executives) may use payroll deductions to acquire Company common stock at a purchase price of \n85\n% of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of a \nthree-month\n purchase period. A total of \n2.0\n million shares may be issued under the ESPP, and as of December 31, 2024, there were \n1.4\n million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP is considered compensatory. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued approximately \n90,000\n, \n87,000\n and \n82,000\n shares, respectively, under the ESPP.\nNote 11: Long-Term Debt\nThe Company obtains long-term debt through AWCC primarily to fund capital expenditures of the Regulated Businesses, to repay or refinance existing long-term and short-term debt, and to lend funds to parent company to refinance debt and for other purposes. \nPresented in the table below are the components of long-term debt as of December 31:\nRate\nWeighted Average Rate\nMaturity\n2024\n2023\nLong-term debt of AWCC: \n(a)\n \n \n \n \n \nSenior notes—fixed rate\n2.30\n%-\n8.27\n%\n4.02\n%\n2025-2054\n$\n11,786\n \n$\n10,786\n \nPrivate activity bonds and government funded debt—fixed rate\n0.00\n%-\n3.88\n%\n3.07\n%\n2028-2045\n187\n \n188\n \nLong-term debt of other American Water subsidiaries:\n \n \n \nPrivate activity bonds and government funded debt—fixed rate\n0.00\n%-\n5.00\n%\n2.04\n%\n2025-2061\n761\n \n729\n \nMortgage bonds—fixed rate\n6.35\n%-\n9.19\n%\n7.41\n%\n2025-2039\n456\n \n516\n \nMandatorily redeemable preferred stock\n8.47\n%-\n9.75\n%\n8.64\n%\n2036\n3\n \n3\n \nLong-term debt\n \n4.01\n%\n \n13,193\n \n12,222\n \nUnamortized debt discount, net \n(b)\n(\n20\n)\n(\n11\n)\nUnamortized debt issuance costs\n \n \n \n(\n15\n)\n(\n18\n)\nLess current portion of long-term debt\n \n \n \n(\n637\n)\n(\n475\n)\nTotal long-term debt\n \n \n \n$\n12,521\n \n$\n11,718\n \n(a)\nThis indebtedness is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s payment obligations under such indebtedness.\n(b)\nIncludes debt discount, net of fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting.\nAll mortgage bonds and $\n752\n million of the private activity bonds and government funded debt held by the Company’s subsidiaries were collateralized as of December 31, 2024.\nLong-term debt agreements contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, AWCC from issuing debt secured by the Company’s consolidated assets.

At the closing of this offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $\n1,381\n million. AWCC used the net proceeds of the offering (i) to lend funds to American Water and the Regulated Businesses; (ii) to repay at maturity AWCC’s \n3.850\n% Senior Notes due 2024; (iii) to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.\nOn June 29, 2023, AWCC issued $\n1,035\n million aggregate principal amount of \n3.625\n% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). AWCC received net proceeds of approximately $\n1,022\n million, after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deduction of offering expenses payable by AWCC. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2026 (the “Maturity Date”), unless earlier exchanged or repurchased.\nThe Notes are exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 5.8213 shares of parent company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $\n171.78\n per share of common stock). The initial exchange rate of the Notes is subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture pursuant to which the Notes were issued (the “Note Indenture”). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2026, the Notes are exchangeable at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods described in the Note Indenture. On or after March 15, 2026, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions or periods. Upon any exchange of the Notes, AWCC will (i) pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and (ii) pay or deliver (or cause to be delivered), as the case may be, cash, shares of parent company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of such common stock, at AWCC's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of AWCC’s exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being exchanged. \nAWCC may not redeem the Notes prior to the Maturity Date, and no sinking fund is provided for the Notes. Subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes will have the right to require AWCC to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined in the Note Indenture, at a repurchase price of \n100\n% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\n109\nTable of Contents\nOne of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as treasury lock agreements. The Company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutions having long-term credit ratings of “A-” or better.\nDuring the second half of 2024, the Company entered into \neight\n treasury lock agreements, with a term of \n10\n years or \n30\n years, with notional amounts totaling $\n355\n million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2025. These treasury lock agreements terminate in June 2025 and December 2025 and have an average fixed interest rate of \n4.03\n%. In 2025, the Company entered into \nfive\n additional treasury lock agreements, with a term of \n10\n years, with notional amounts totaling $\n275\n million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2025. These treasury lock agreements terminate in March 2025 and have an average fixed interest rate of \n4.60\n%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss.\nThe Company had entered into \n15\n treasury lock agreements through February 2024, with notional amounts totaling $\n825\n million. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. In February 2024, the Company terminated the treasury lock agreements realizing a pre-tax net gain of $\n14\n million, to be amortized through Interest expense over a \n10\n-year period or \n30-year\n period, in accordance with the tenor of the notes issued on February 23, 2024.\nNo\n ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nNote 12: Short-Term Debt\nLiquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are generally funded through cash flows from operations, public and private debt offerings, issuances of commercial paper and equity, and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the AWCC revolving credit facility. AWCC maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility which provides $\n2.75\n billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. On October 28, 2024, the termination date of the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility was extended, as permitted by the terms of the credit agreement, from October 2028 to October 2029. The revolving credit facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support and to provide a sub-limit for the issuance of up to $\n150\n million in letters of credit. Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. \nSubject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of \n$\n500\n million\n.\n The Company regularly evaluates the capital markets and closely monitors the financial condition of the financial institutions with contractual commitments in its revolving credit facility.

The state NOL carryforwards expire in 2025 through 2044.\n112\nTable of Contents\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA contains a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“CAMT”) provision on applicable corporations effective January 1, 2023. To determine if a company is considered an applicable corporation subject to CAMT, the company’s average adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) for the three consecutive years preceding the tax year must exceed $1.0 billion. An applicable corporation must make several adjustments to net income when determining AFSI. A corporation paying CAMT is eligible for a future tax credit, which can be carried forward indefinitely and utilized when regular tax exceeds CAMT. Based on current guidance, the Company is an applicable corporation subject to CAMT beginning in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has a CAMT credit carryforward of $\n111\n million.\nOn September 12, 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the U.S. Treasury issued Notice 2024-66, allowing corporate taxpayers to exclude amounts attributable to the CAMT liability, without penalty, from estimated tax payments with respect to a taxable year that begins during 2024. The Company will include the CAMT liability in its 2024 extension payment due April 15, 2025. The Company will continue to assess the impacts of the IRA as the U.S. Treasury and the IRS provide further guidance.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for taxable years ended December 31, 2019 and prior.\nPresented in the table below are the changes in gross liability, excluding interest and penalties, for unrecognized tax benefits:\nAmount\nBalance as of January 1, 2022\n$\n140\n \nIncreases in current period tax positions\n26\n \nDecreases in prior period measurement of tax positions\n(\n8\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n158\n \nIncreases in current period tax positions\n27\n \nDecreases in prior period measurement of tax positions\n(\n37\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n148\n \nIncreases in current period tax positions\n34\n \nIncreases in prior period measurement of tax positions\n21\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n203\n \nThe Company’s tax positions relate primarily to the deductions claimed for repair and maintenance costs on its utility plant. The Company expects a reduction of approximately $\n81\n million in its unrecognized tax benefits within the next year due to the expiration of statutes of limitation, offset by current year activity. \nIf the Company sustains all of its positions as of December 31, 2024, an unrecognized tax benefit of $\n8\n million, excluding interest and penalties, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had an immaterial amount of interest and penalties related to its tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nPresented in the table below are the changes in the valuation allowance:\nAmount\nBalance as of January 1, 2022\n$\n10\n \nIncreases in current period tax positions\n1\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n11\n \nIncreases in current period tax positions\n—\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n11\n \nDecreases in current period tax positions\n(\n3\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n8\n \n113\nTable of Contents\nNote 15: Employee Benefits \nOverview of Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans\nThe Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations. Benefits under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for all new employees. The pension plans were closed for most employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, except for specific eligible groups specified in the plan, had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006, are provided with a defined contribution plan that includes a \n5.25\n% of base pay Company-funded defined contribution account. The Company does not participate in a multi-employer plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees.\nThe Company’s pension funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or the normal cost. Further, the Company will consider additional cash contributions and/or available prefunding balances if needed to avoid “at risk” status and benefit restrictions under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”). The Company may also consider increased contributions, based on other financial requirements and the plans’ funded position. Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates charged for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. See Note 3—Regulatory Matters for additional information. Pension plan assets are invested in a number of actively managed, commingled funds, and limited partnerships including equities, fixed income securities, guaranteed annuity contracts with insurance companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).\nThe Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002. The Company’s policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up to the amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a number of actively managed funds in the form of separate accounts, commingled funds and limited partnerships, including equities and fixed income securities.\nThe Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g., fixed income, equity, alternatives) or strategy for which they have been appointed. Investment management agreements and recurring performance and attribution analysis are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used to adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan’s targeted investment policy.\nIn order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to long duration fixed income investments that are exposed to interest rate risk. Increases in interest rates generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of the liabilities. Conversely, rate decreases will increase fixed income assets, partially offsetting the related increase in the liabilities. Within equities, risk is mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process. For the Bargained Retiree Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“Bargained VEBA”) trust, its asset structure is designed to meet the cash flows of the liabilities. This design reduces the plan’s exposure to changes in interest rates.\nActual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, if necessary.\nPension Plan Assets\n The investment policy guideline of the pension plan is focused on diversification, improving returns and reducing the volatility of the funded status over a long-term horizon. None of the Company’s securities are included in pension plan assets.\nThe Company uses fair value for all classes of assets in the calculation of market-related value of plan assets. As of December 31, 2024, the fair values and asset allocations of the pension plan assets include the American Water Pension Plan and the American Water Pension Plan for Certain Inactive Participants.\n114\nTable of Contents\nPresented in the tables below are the fair values and asset allocations of the pension plan assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, by asset category:\nAsset Category\nTotal\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)\nSignificant Observable Inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) (a)\nNet Asset Value as a Practical Expedient \nPercentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2024\nCash\n$\n40\n \n$\n40\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n3\n \n%\nEquity securities:\n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. large cap\n155\n \n29\n \n—\n \n—\n \n126\n \n11\n \n%\nU.S. small cap\n34\n \n34\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n%\nInternational\n258\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n258\n \n19\n \n%\nReal estate fund\n120\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n120\n \n9\n \n%\nREITs\n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6\n \n—\n \n%\nFixed income securities:\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds\n232\n \n169\n \n1\n \n—\n \n62\n \n17\n \n%\nCorporate bonds\n489\n \n—\n \n489\n \n—\n \n—\n \n35\n \n%\nMortgage-backed securities\n6\n \n—\n \n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n%\nMunicipal bonds\n20\n \n—\n \n20\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n%\nGuarantee annuity contracts\n32\n \n—\n \n—\n \n32\n \n—\n \n2\n \n%\nTotal\n$\n1,392\n \n$\n272\n \n$\n516\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n572\n \n100\n \n%\nAsset Category\nTotal\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)\nSignificant Observable Inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) (a)\nNet Asset Value as a Practical Expedient\nPercentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2023\nCash\n$\n56\n \n$\n56\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n4\n \n%\nEquity securities:\n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. large cap\n134\n \n23\n \n—\n \n—\n \n111\n \n9\n \n%\nU.S. small cap\n37\n \n37\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \n%\nInternational\n235\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n235\n \n16\n \n%\nReal estate fund\n132\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n132\n \n9\n \n%\nREITs\n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6\n \n—\n \n%\nFixed income securities:\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds\n234\n \n171\n \n2\n \n—\n \n61\n \n16\n \n%\nCorporate bonds\n531\n \n—\n \n531\n \n—\n \n—\n \n38\n \n%\nMortgage-backed securities\n8\n \n—\n \n8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n%\nMunicipal bonds\n23\n \n—\n \n23\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n%\nLong duration bond fund\n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n%\nGuarantee annuity contracts\n32\n \n—\n \n—\n \n32\n \n—\n \n2\n \n%\nTotal\n$\n1,431\n \n$\n287\n \n$\n564\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n548\n \n100\n \n%\n(a)\nThere were no material changes during the period for the fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company’s 2025 target pension plan asset allocation is \n37\n% equity securities and \n63\n% fixed income securities. The Company’s 2024 target pension plan asset allocation was \n37\n% equity securities and \n63\n% fixed income securities.\n115\nTable of Contents\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\nThe investment policy guidelines of the postretirement plans focus on the appropriate strategy given the funded status of the plans. None of the Company’s securities are included in other postretirement benefit plan assets. The Company’s postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and risk mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored specifically for each trust. In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the selected asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically updates the long-term, strategic asset allocations for these plans through asset liability studies and uses various analytics to determine the optimal asset allocation. Considerations include plan liability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. The American Water Retiree Welfare Plan (“Retiree Welfare Plan”) is funded by the Bargained VEBA trust, the Non-Bargained Retiree Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“Non-Bargained VEBA”) trust, the Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“Active VEBA”) trust, and the American Water Life Insurance Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association Trust.\nPresented in the tables below are the fair values and asset allocations of the postretirement benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, by asset category:\nAsset Category\nTotal\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)\nSignificant Observable Inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nNet Asset Value as a Practical Expedient \nPercentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2024\nBargained VEBA:\n \n \n \n \n \nCash\n$\n4\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n4\n \n%\nFixed income securities:\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds\n7\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n7\n \n%\nCorporate bonds\n83\n \n—\n \n83\n \n—\n \n—\n \n86\n \n%\nMunicipal bonds\n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \n%\nTotal bargained VEBA\n$\n97\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n100\n \n%\nActive VEBA:\nCash\n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n7\n \n%\nFixed income securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds\n2\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n7\n \n%\nCorporate bonds\n23\n \n—\n \n23\n \n—\n \n—\n \n82\n \n%\nMunicipal bonds\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n%\nTotal Active VEBA\n$\n28\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n100\n \n%\nNon-bargained VEBA:\n \n \n \n \n \nCash\n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n2\n \n%\nEquity securities:\n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. large cap\n46\n \n46\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n36\n \n%\nInternational\n30\n \n30\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n23\n \n%\nFixed income securities:\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds\n1\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n%\nMunicipal bonds\n48\n \n—\n \n48\n \n—\n \n—\n \n38\n \n%\nTotal non-bargained VEBA\n$\n128\n \n$\n80\n \n$\n48\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n100\n \n%\nTotal\n$\n253\n \n$\n95\n \n$\n158\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n100\n \n%\n116\nTable of Contents\nAsset Category\nTotal\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)\nSignificant Observable Inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nNet Asset Value as a Practical Expedient\nPercentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2023\nBargained VEBA:\n \n \n \n \n \nCash\n$\n4\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n4\n \n%\nFixed income securities:\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds\n7\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n7\n \n%\nCorporate bonds\n86\n \n—\n \n86\n \n—\n \n—\n \n85\n \n%\nMunicipal bonds\n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n%\nTotal bargained VEBA\n$\n101\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n100\n \n%\nActive VEBA:\nCash\n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n6\n \n%\nFixed income securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds\n2\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6\n \n%\nCorporate bonds\n26\n \n—\n \n26\n \n—\n \n—\n \n82\n \n%\nMunicipal bonds\n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6\n \n%\nTotal Active VEBA\n$\n32\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n100\n \n%\nNon-bargained VEBA:\n \n \n \n \n \nCash\n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n2\n \n%\nEquity securities:\n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. large cap\n44\n \n44\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n35\n \n%\nInternational\n30\n \n30\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n24\n \n%\nFixed income securities:\n \n \n \n \nMunicipal bonds\n49\n \n—\n \n49\n \n—\n \n—\n \n39\n \n%\nTotal non-bargained VEBA\n$\n125\n \n$\n76\n \n$\n49\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n100\n \n%\nTotal\n$\n258\n \n$\n91\n \n$\n167\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n100\n \n%\nThe Company’s 2025 target postretirement benefit plan asset allocation for the Bargained VEBA and Active VEBA is \n100\n% fixed income securities and for the Non-bargained VEBA is \n60\n% equity securities and \n40\n% fixed income securities.

Certain equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level 1. Other equities, such as certain U.S. large cap and international securities held in the pension plan, are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships. These funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. Since NAV is not directly observable or not available on a nationally recognized securities exchange for the commingled funds and/or limited partnerships, they are not included in the fair value hierarchy as they are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. These investments can typically be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with \n30\n or less days of notice and without further restrictions.\n117\nTable of Contents\nFixed-income securities—Certain U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets and their prices can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain government bonds are based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities. These securities are categorized as Level 2 because the valuations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. Exchange-traded future and option positions are reported in accordance with changes in variation margins that are settled daily. Exchange-traded futures and options, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are classified as Level 1. Other U.S. Treasury securities are invested in commingled funds that may implement their investment strategies in a variety of ways which may include direct and/or indirect investment in securities and other instruments or assets (e.g., futures and swaps) or investment in units of other commingled funds. These funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. Since NAV is not directly observable or not available on a nationally recognized securities exchange for the commingled funds, they are not included in the fair value hierarchy as they are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. These investments can typically be redeemed daily, with no prior notice and without further restrictions. \nReal estate fund—Real estate funds are an investment vehicle in the form of a limited partnership primarily focused in real estate investments and are not included in the fair value hierarchy as they are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. These investments can typically be redeemed quarterly, with \n90\n or less days of notice, subject to available cash.\nREITs—REITs are invested in commingled funds primarily focused in publicly traded shares of real estate investment trusts. Commingled funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. REITs are not included in the fair value hierarchy as they are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. These investments can typically be redeemed daily, with no prior notice and without further restrictions.\nGuaranteed annuity contracts—Guaranteed annuity contracts are categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these market values are determined by the provider, they are not highly observable and have been categorized as Level 3. \n118\nTable of Contents\nBenefit Obligations, Plan Assets and Funded Status\nPresented in the table below is a rollforward of the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets for the two most recent years, for all plans combined:\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nChange in benefit obligation:\n \n \n \n \nBenefit obligation as of January 1,\n$\n1,622\n \n$\n1,578\n \n$\n247\n \n$\n255\n \nService cost\n17\n \n17\n \n2\n \n2\n \nInterest cost\n83\n \n85\n \n12\n \n14\n \nPlan participants' contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \n3\n \nActuarial loss (gain)\n(\n55\n)\n67\n \n(\n18\n)\n(\n4\n)\nSettlements \n(\n2\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nGross benefits paid\n(\n105\n)\n(\n118\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n24\n)\nFederal subsidy\n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \nOther adjustments\n—\n \n(\n4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nBenefit obligation as of December 31,\n$\n1,560\n \n$\n1,622\n \n$\n225\n \n$\n247\n \nChange in plan assets:\n \n \n \n \nFair value of plan assets as of January 1,\n$\n1,431\n \n$\n1,413\n \n$\n258\n \n$\n254\n \nActual return on plan assets\n19\n \n93\n \n11\n \n22\n \nEmployer contributions\n49\n \n46\n \n3\n \n3\n \nPlan participants' contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \n3\n \nSettlements\n(\n2\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n105\n)\n(\n118\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n24\n)\nFair value of plan assets as of December 31,\n$\n1,392\n \n$\n1,431\n \n$\n253\n \n$\n258\n \nFunded value as of December 31,\n$\n(\n168\n)\n$\n(\n191\n)\n$\n28\n \n$\n11\n \nAmounts recognized on the balance sheet:\n \n \n \n \nNoncurrent asset\n$\n51\n \n$\n73\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n12\n \nCurrent liability\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nNoncurrent liability\n(\n217\n)\n(\n262\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nNet amount recognized\n$\n(\n168\n)\n$\n(\n191\n)\n$\n28\n \n$\n11\n \nPresented in the table below are the components of accumulated other comprehensive income and regulatory assets that have not been recognized as components of periodic benefit costs as of December 31:\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet actuarial loss\n$\n337\n \n$\n340\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n30\n \nPrior service credit\n(\n5\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n84\n)\n(\n115\n)\nNet amount recognized\n$\n332\n \n$\n332\n \n$\n(\n71\n)\n$\n(\n85\n)\nRegulatory assets (liabilities)\n$\n304\n \n$\n300\n \n$\n(\n71\n)\n$\n(\n85\n)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income\n28\n \n32\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n332\n \n$\n332\n \n$\n(\n71\n)\n$\n(\n85\n)\n119\nTable of Contents\nPresented in the tables below are the aggregate projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a projected obligation in excess of plan assets as of December 31:\nProjected Benefit Obligation Exceeds the Fair Value of Plans' Assets\n2024\n2023\nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n916\n \n$\n952\n \nFair value of plan assets\n697\n \n688\n \n \nAccumulated Benefit Obligation Exceeds the Fair Value of Plans' Assets\n2024\n2023\nAccumulated benefit obligation\n$\n852\n \n$\n875\n \nFair value of plan assets\n697\n \n688\n \nThe accumulated postretirement plan assets exceed benefit obligations for the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans, except for the Northern Illinois Retiree Welfare Plan, of which the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is inconsequential for all periods presented. \nContributions\nThe PPA requires that defined benefit plans contribute to 100% of the current liability funding target over seven years. Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of the current liability are defined as being “at risk” and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The Company’s qualified defined benefit plan is currently funded above the at-risk threshold, and therefore the Company expects that the plans will not be subject to the “at risk” funding requirements of the PPA. The Company is proactively monitoring the plan’s funded status and projected contributions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.\nMinimum funding requirements for the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined by government regulations and not by accounting pronouncements. The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2025 to the qualified pension plans. Contributions may be in the form of cash contributions as well as available prefunding balances.\nPresented in the table below is information about the expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement benefit plans:\nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\n2025 expected employer contributions:\n \n \nTo plan trusts\n$\n44\n \n$\n—\n \nTo plan participants\n2\n \n—\n \nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nPresented in the table below are the net benefits expected to be paid from the plan assets or the Company’s assets:\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\nExpected Benefit Payments\nExpected Benefit Payments\nExpected Federal Subsidy Payments\n2025\n$\n121\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n1\n \n2026\n122\n \n22\n \n1\n \n2027\n124\n \n22\n \n1\n \n2028\n124\n \n21\n \n1\n \n2029\n125\n \n20\n \n1\n \n2030-2034\n612\n \n90\n \n2\n \nBecause the above amounts are net benefits, plan participants’ contributions have been excluded from the expected benefits.\n120\nTable of Contents\nAssumptions\nAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes.\nPresented in the table below are the significant assumptions related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans:\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine December 31 benefit obligations:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscount rate\n5.70\n%\n5.18\n%\n5.58\n%\n5.69\n%\n5.22\n%\n5.60\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.51\n%\n3.51\n%\n3.51\n%\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nMedical trend\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\ngraded from\ngraded from\ngraded from\n \n \n \n \n6.50\n% in 2025\n6.75\n% in 2024\n7.00\n% in 2023\n \n \n \n \nto \n5.00\n% in 2031+\nto \n5.00\n% in 2031+\nto \n5.00\n% in 2031+\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscount rate\n5.18\n%\n5.58\n%\n2.94\n%\n5.22\n%\n5.60\n%\n2.90\n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n6.73\n%\n6.79\n%\n6.50\n%\n5.00\n%\n5.00\n%\n3.60\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.51\n%\n3.51\n%\n3.51\n%\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nMedical trend\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\ngraded from\ngraded from\ngraded from\n \n \n \n \n6.75\n% in 2024\n7.00\n% in 2023\n6.00\n% in 2022\n \n \n \n \nto \n5.00\n%  in 2031+\nto \n5.00\n% in 2031+\nto \n5.00\n% in 2026+\nNOTE:     “N/A” in the table above means assumption is not applicable.\nThe discount rate assumption was determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently. The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. Historically, for each plan, the discount rate was developed at the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment management fees, for current and planned asset classes in the plans’ investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans’ projected asset classes were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio was developed, adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared to the benchmark returns. The Company’s pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases. The Company used a weighted average expected return on plan assets of \n6.73\n% to estimate its 2024 pension benefit costs, and an expected blended return based on weighted assets of \n5.00\n% to estimate its 2024 other postretirement benefit costs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s mortality assumption utilized the Pri-2012 base mortality table with the MP-2021 mortality improvement scale.\n121\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost\nPresented in the table below are the components of net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nComponents of net periodic pension benefit cost (credit):\n \n \n \nService cost\n$\n17\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n30\n \nInterest cost\n83\n \n85\n \n64\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n94\n)\n(\n94\n)\n(\n122\n)\nAmortization of prior service (credit) cost\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nAmortization of actuarial loss\n22\n \n13\n \n21\n \nSettlements\n1\n \n1\n \n—\n \nNet periodic pension benefit cost (credit)\n$\n26\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n(\n10\n)\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income:\n \n \n \nCurrent year actuarial (gain) loss\n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n14\n)\nAmortization of actuarial loss\n—\n \n(\n4\n)\n(\n3\n)\nTotal recognized in other comprehensive income\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n17\n)\nTotal recognized in net periodic benefit cost (credit) and other comprehensive income\n$\n25\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n(\n27\n)\nComponents of net periodic other postretirement benefit (credit) cost:\n \n \n \nService cost\n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n3\n \nInterest cost\n12\n \n14\n \n10\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n12\n)\n(\n12\n)\n(\n19\n)\nAmortization of prior service credit\n(\n31\n)\n(\n31\n)\n(\n31\n)\nAmortization of actuarial loss\n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \nNet periodic other postretirement benefit (credit) cost\n$\n(\n29\n)\n$\n(\n25\n)\n$\n(\n37\n)\nSavings Plans for Employees\nThe Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions that are invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employee’s contribution, subject to certain limitations. Due to the Company’s discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006, the Company began providing an additional \n5.25\n% of base pay defined contribution benefit for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The Company’s 401(k) savings plan expenses totaled $\n15\n million, $\n14\n million and $\n13\n million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, the Company’s \n5.25\n% of base pay defined contribution benefit expenses totaled $\n18\n million, $\n17\n million and $\n16\n million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All of the Company’s contributions are invested in one or more funds at the direction of the employees.\nNote 16: Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments have been made in connection with certain construction programs. The estimated capital expenditures required under legal and binding contractual obligations amounted to $\n1.1\n billion as of December 31, 2024.\n122\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s regulated subsidiaries maintain agreements with other water purveyors for the purchase of water to supplement their water supply. \nPresented in the table below are the future annual commitments related to minimum quantities of purchased water having non-cancelable contracts:\nAmount\n2025\n$\n81\n \n2026\n70\n \n2027\n63\n \n2028\n64\n \n2029\n64\n \nThereafter\n859\n \nThe Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers. See Note 4—Revenue Recognition for additional information regarding the Company’s performance obligations.\nContingencies\nThe Company is routinely involved in legal actions incident to the normal conduct of its business. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has accrued approximately $\n16\n million of probable loss contingencies and has estimated that the maximum amount of loss associated with reasonably possible loss contingencies arising out of such legal actions, which can be reasonably estimated, is $\n9\n million. For certain legal actions, the Company is unable to estimate possible losses. The Company believes that damages or settlements, if any, recovered by plaintiffs in such legal actions, other than as described in this Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nDunbar, West Virginia Class Action Litigation\nOn the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of the West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary (“WVAWC”). The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately \n25,000\n WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was completed, and service was restored that day to approximately \n80\n% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately \n20\n% by the next morning. The second repair showed signs of leaking, but the water main was usable until June 29, 2015, to allow tanks to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately \n3,000\n customers while a final repair was being completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully restored by July 1, 2015, to all customers affected by this event.\nOn June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned \nJeffries, et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company \nwas filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The \nJeffries\n plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage.\nIn February 2020, the \nJeffries\n plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if imposed. In July 2020, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the \nJeffries\n plaintiffs’ motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denying certification of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. Trial in this matter had been scheduled for January 2025.\nOn January 17, 2025, before trial commenced, the parties notified the Circuit Court that an agreement in principle to settle this litigation was reached among the parties. Under the terms of the agreement in principle and any subsequent proposed settlement agreement, WVAWC has not admitted, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the \nJeffries\n plaintiffs. The proposed maximum pre-tax amount of the settlement is approximately $\n18\n million, of which the Company currently estimates that approximately $\n5\n million would be contributed by the Company and WVAWC, and the remainder would be contributed by certain of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers. The actual total amount to be paid to claimants through this settlement will depend upon the claims submitted and approved through a claims process to be negotiated by the parties and approved by the Circuit Court. The parties will next negotiate and enter into a proposed settlement agreement based on the terms of the agreement in principle, and the proposed settlement agreement will be subject to preliminary and final approvals by the Circuit Court.\n123\nTable of Contents\nThe final amount of the Company’s and WVAWC’s contributions to the settlement remains subject to uncertainty; however, the Company does not currently anticipate that Company’s maximum liability for the settlement will materially exceed $\n5\n million. As a result, the Company has recorded a charge to earnings, net of insurance receivables, of $\n5.0\n million ($\n3.9\n million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company intends to fund its and WVAWC’s contributions to the settlement through existing sources of liquidity, although no contribution by the Company or WVAWC will be required unless and until a proposed settlement agreement has been entered into and finally approved by the Circuit Court.\nChattanooga, Tennessee Class Action Litigation\nOn September 12, 2019, the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary (“TAWC”), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all customers on September 16, 2019.\nOn September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned \nBruce, et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al.\n was filed in the Circuit Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and American Water Works Service Company, Inc. (“Service Company” and, together with TAWC and the Company, collectively, the “Tennessee-American Water Defendants”), on behalf of a proposed class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered monetary losses as a result of the Chattanooga incident (the “Tennessee Plaintiffs”). The complaint alleged breach of contract and negligence against the Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. In the complaint as originally filed, the Tennessee Plaintiffs were seeking an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. \nIn September 2020, the court dismissed all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ claims in their complaint, except for the breach of contract claims against TAWC, which remain pending. In October 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties have been engaging in discovery. In January 2023, after hearing oral argument, the court issued an oral ruling denying the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. In February 2023, the Tennessee Plaintiffs sought reconsideration of the ruling by the court, and any final ruling is appealable to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, as allowed under Tennessee law. In September 2023, the court upheld its prior ruling but gave the Tennessee Plaintiffs the option to file an amended class definition. In October 2023, the Tennessee Plaintiffs filed an amended class definition seeking certification of a business customer-only class. On June 14, 2024, the court issued its written order denying the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ amended class and incorporating its denial of certification of the original residential class. On June 21, 2024, the Tennessee Plaintiffs appealed both of the court’s orders denying class certification. This appeal remains pending.\nThe Company and TAWC believe that TAWC has valid, meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint. TAWC will continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations. Given the current stage of this proceeding, the Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range of loss related to this proceeding.\nMountaineer Gas Company Main Break\nDuring the afternoon of November 10, 2023, WVAWC was informed that an 8-inch ductile iron water main owned by WVAWC, located on the West Side of Charleston, West Virginia and originally installed in approximately 1989, experienced a leak. In the early morning hours of November 11, 2023, WVAWC crews successfully completed a repair to the water main. A precautionary boil water advisory was issued the same day to approximately \n300\n WVAWC customers and ultimately lifted on November 12, 2023.\nOn November 10, 2023, a break was reported in a low-pressure natural gas main located near the affected WVAWC water main, and an inflow of water into the natural gas main and associated delivery pipelines occurred. The natural gas main and pipelines are owned by Mountaineer Gas Company, a regulated natural gas distribution company serving over \n220,000\n customers in West Virginia (“Mountaineer Gas”). The resulting inflow of water into the natural gas main and related pipelines resulted in a loss of natural gas service to approximately \n1,500\n Mountaineer Gas customers, as well as water entering customer service lines and certain natural gas appliances owned or used by some of the affected Mountaineer Gas customers. Mountaineer Gas reported that restoration of natural gas service to all affected gas mains occurred on November 24, 2023. The timing, order and causation of both the WVAWC water main break and Mountaineer Gas’s main break are currently unknown and under investigation.\n124\nTable of Contents\nTo date, a total of \nfour\n pending lawsuits have been filed against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC purportedly on behalf of customers in Charleston, West Virginia related to these incidents. On November 14, 2023, a complaint captioned \nRuffin et al. v. Mountaineer Gas Company and West Virginia-American Water Company\n was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of Mountaineer Gas residential and business customers and other households and businesses supplied with natural gas in Kanawha County, which lost natural gas service on November 10, 2023, as a result of these events. The complaint alleges, among other things, breach of contract by Mountaineer Gas, trespass by WVAWC, nuisance by WVAWC, violation of statutory obligations by Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC, and negligence by Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC. The complaint seeks class-wide damages against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC for loss of use of natural gas, annoyance, inconvenience and lost profits, as well as punitive damages.\nOn November 15, 2023, a complaint captioned \nToliver et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company and Mountaineer Gas Company\n was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of all natural persons or entities who are citizens of the State of West Virginia and who are customers of WVAWC and/or Mountaineer Gas in the affected areas. The complaint alleges against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC, among other things, negligence, nuisance, trespass and strict liability, as well as breach of contract against Mountaineer Gas. The complaint seeks class-wide damages against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC for property damage, loss of use and enjoyment of property, annoyance and inconvenience and business losses, as well as punitive damages.\nOn November 16, 2023, a complaint captioned \nDodson et al. v. West Virginia American Water and Mountaineer Gas Company\n was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of all West Virginia citizens living between Pennsylvania Avenue south of Washington Street, and Iowa Street, who are customers of Mountaineer Gas. The complaint alleges against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC, among other things, negligence, nuisance, trespass, statutory code violations and unfair or deceptive business practices. The complaint seeks class-wide damages against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC for property loss and damage, loss of use and enjoyment of property, mental and emotional distress, and aggravation and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages.\nOn January 4, 2024, a fourth complaint, captioned \nThomas v. West Virginia-American Water Company and Mountaineer Gas Company\n, was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County asserting similar allegations as those included in the \nRuffin\n, \nToliver\n and \nDodson\n lawsuits, with the addition of counts alleging unjust enrichment and violations of the West Virginia Human Rights Act and the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act.\nOn November 17, 2023, the \nRuffin\n plaintiff filed a motion to consolidate the class action lawsuits before a single judge in Kanawha County Circuit Court. On June 14, 2024, the judge in the \nRuffin\n case partially granted the motion by transferring all of the \nfour\n class action lawsuits to her court but deferring as premature consolidation of the cases.\nOn December 5, 2023, a complaint captioned \nMountaineer Gas Company v. West Virginia-American Water Company\n was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County seeking damages under theories of trespass, negligence and implied indemnity. The damages being sought related to the incident include, among other things, repair and response costs incurred by Mountaineer Gas and attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by Mountaineer Gas. On December 14, 2023, Mountaineer Gas filed a motion with the Supreme Court of West Virginia to transfer this case to the West Virginia Business Court. On December 29, 2023, WVAWC filed a joinder in the motion to transfer the case. WVAWC has also filed a partial motion to dismiss this lawsuit. On March 6, 2024, the motion to transfer this complaint to the West Virginia Business Court was granted and trial and resolution judges were assigned. Mountaineer Gas voluntarily dismissed its implied indemnity count against WVAWC, rendering moot WVAWC’s partial motion to dismiss, and on May 31, 2024, WVAWC answered the complaint. The Business Court has set a trial date of October 7, 2025, for this matter.\nOn December 20, 2023, Mountaineer Gas filed answers to each of the first \nthree\n class action lawsuits, which included cross-claims against WVAWC alleging that Mountaineer Gas is without fault for the claims and damages alleged in the lawsuits and WVAWC should be required to indemnify Mountaineer Gas for any damages and for attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by Mountaineer Gas in the lawsuits. WVAWC has filed a partial motion to dismiss certain claims in the \nRuffin, Toliver,\n \nDodson \nand \nThomas \nlawsuits and a motion to dismiss the cross-claims asserted against WVAWC therein by Mountaineer Gas. Mountaineer Gas subsequently voluntarily dismissed its cross-claims. On January 30, 2024, a motion was filed with the West Virginia Supreme Court on behalf of the \nToliver \nplaintiff to refer the \nfour\n class action complaints and the \nMountaineer Gas \ncomplaint to the West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel. On February 7, 2024, WVAWC filed a motion joining in that referral request. On February 19, 2024, Mountaineer Gas filed a motion opposing the referral of the \nfour\n class action complaints and the \nMountaineer Gas\n complaint to the West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel. On May 31, 2024, the West Virginia Supreme Court denied the motion seeking referral. The Kanawha County Circuit Court has set a trial date of February 2, 2026, for the class action complaints.\n125\nTable of Contents\nOn December 6, 2023, WVAWC initiated a process whereby Mountaineer Gas customers could file claims with WVAWC and seek payment from WVAWC of up to $\n2,000\n in damages per affected household for the inconvenience arising from a loss of use of their appliances and documented out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the natural gas outage. In light of the diminishing number of new claims that had been filed, the claims process was concluded on March 8, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, a total of \n594\n Mountaineer Gas customers completed this claims process, and each of those customers has been paid by WVAWC an average of approximately $\n1,500\n. In return, these customers were required to execute a partial release of liability in favor of WVAWC.\nOn November 16, 2023, the WVPSC issued an order initiating a general investigation into both the water main break and natural gas outages occurring in this incident to determine the cause or causes thereof, as well as breaks and outages generally throughout the systems of WVAWC and Mountaineer Gas and the utility practices of both utilities. Following a series of disagreements among the parties regarding the scope of discovery, the WVPSC closed the general investigation into both utilities and ordered a separate general investigation for each utility. The WVPSC focused the \ntwo\n general investigations away from the cause of the events and instead on the maintenance practices of each utility during and after the main breaks. On January 29, 2024, the Consumer Advocate Division of the WVPSC filed a motion to intervene in the WVAWC general investigation. \nOn April 24, 2024, the staff issued a final joint memorandum in the Mountaineer Gas general investigation stating its view that Mountaineer Gas responded appropriately, reasonably and according to Mountaineer Gas’s written procedures. The staff is making no recommendations for improvements to Mountaineer Gas and is recommending that the Mountaineer Gas general investigation be closed. On July 24, 2024, the staff issued a final joint memorandum in the WVAWC general investigation finding no indication of systematic failure by WVAWC and concluding WVAWC’s maintenance and operating procedures were adequate to ensure safe and reliable service, subject to the implementation by WVAWC of \nthree\n recommended operational improvements. Both general investigations remain pending.\nThe Company and WVAWC believe that the causes of action and other claims asserted against WVAWC in the class action complaints and the lawsuit filed by Mountaineer Gas are without merit and that WVAWC has valid, meritorious defenses to such claims. WVAWC continues to defend itself vigorously in these litigation proceedings. \nGiven the current stage of these proceedings and the general investigation, the Company and WVAWC are currently unable to predict the outcome of any of the proceedings described above, and the Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range of loss related to this proceeding.\nAlternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions\nCompliance with Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions—Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project\nUnder a 2009 order (the “2009 Order”) of the State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”), the Company’s California subsidiary (“Cal Am”) is required to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule. In 2016, the SWRCB issued an order (the “2016 Order,” and, together with the 2009 Order, the “Orders”) approving a deadline of December 31, 2021, for Cal Am’s compliance with these prior orders.\nCal Am is currently involved in developing the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”), which includes the construction of a desalination plant, to be owned by Cal Am, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes Cal Am’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water and the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”), as well as an expanded aquifer storage and recovery program. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill Cal Am’s obligations under the Orders.\nCal Am’s ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is and has been subject to administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies, obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to $\n50\n million in associated incurred costs, plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria.\nIn 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUC’s requirements for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUC’s 2018 decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Am’s cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, which amounted to an aggregate of $\n279\n million plus AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Am’s actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Am’s prudently incurred costs associated with the Water Supply Project upon its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps, operation and maintenance costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters. The reasonableness of the Water Supply Project \n126\nTable of Contents\ncosts will be reviewed by the CPUC when Cal Am seeks cost recovery for the Water Supply Project. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUC costs associated with that program, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service. Cal Am has incurred $\n281\n million in aggregate costs as of December 31, 2024, related to the Water Supply Project, which includes $\n88\n million in AFUDC. \nIn September 2021, Cal Am, Monterey One Water and the MPWMD reached an agreement on Cal Am’s purchase of additional water from an expansion to the GWR Project. On December 5, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision that authorized Cal Am to enter into the amended water purchase agreement, and specifically to increase pumping capacity and reliability of groundwater extraction from the Seaside Groundwater Basin. The final decision sets the cost cap for the proposed facilities at approximately $\n62\n million. Cal Am may seek recovery of amounts above the cost cap in a subsequent rate filing or general rate case. Additionally, the final decision authorizes AFUDC at Cal Am’s actual weighted average cost of debt for most of the facilities. On December 30, 2022, Cal Am filed with the CPUC an application for rehearing of the CPUC’s December 5, 2022, final decision, and on March 30, 2023, the CPUC issued a decision denying Cal Am’s application for rehearing, but adopting its proposed AFUDC for already incurred and future costs. The decision also provided Cal Am the opportunity to serve supplemental testimony to increase its cost cap for certain of the Water Supply Project’s extraction wells. The amended water purchase agreement and a memorandum of understanding to negotiate certain milestones related to the expansion of the GWR Project have been signed by the relevant parties. Further hearings \nwere scheduled in a Phase 2 to this CPUC proceeding to focus on updated supply and demand estimates for the Water Supply Project, and Phase 2 testimony was completed in September 2022. On October 23, 2023, a status conference was held to determine procedural steps to conclude the proceeding. Further evidentiary hearings were held in March 2024. This matter remains pending.\nWhile Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the Orders, as well as relevant final decisions of the CPUC related thereto, Cal Am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the $\n112\n million in aggregate construction costs, plus applicable AFUDC, previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 and December 2022 final decisions, as amended by its March 30, 2023 rehearing decision.\nCoastal Development Permit Application\nIn 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application (the “Marina Application”) to the City of Marina (the “City”) for those project components of the Water Supply Project located within the City’s coastal zone. Members of the City’s Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the Planning Commission of the Marina Application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the Coastal Commission, as permitted under the City’s code and the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application (the “Original Jurisdiction Application”) to the Coastal Commission for a coastal development permit for those project components located within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction. After Coastal Commission staff issued reports recommending denial of the Original Jurisdiction Application, noting potential impacts on environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands and possible disproportionate impacts to communities of concern, in September 2020, Cal Am withdrew the Original Jurisdiction Application in order to address the staff’s environmental justice concerns. In November 2020, Cal Am refiled the Original Jurisdiction Application.\nIn October 2022, Cal Am announced a phasing plan for the proposed desalination plant component of the Water Supply Project. The desalination plant and slant wells originally approved by the CPUC would produce up to \n6.4\n million gallons of desalinated water per day. Under the phased approach, the facilities would initially be constructed to produce up to \n4.8\n million gallons per day of desalinated water, enough to meet anticipated demand through about 2030, and would limit the number of slant wells initially constructed. As demand increases in the future, desalination facilities would be expanded to meet the additional demand. The phased approach seeks to meet near-term demand by allowing for additional supply as it becomes needed, while also providing an opportunity for regional future public participation and was developed by Cal Am based on feedback received from the community.\nIn November 2022, the Coastal Commission approved the Marina Application and the Original Jurisdiction Application with respect to the phased development of the proposed desalination plant, subject to compliance with a number of conditions, all of which Cal Am expects to satisfy. In December 2022, the City, Marina Coast Water District (“MCWD”), MCWD’s groundwater sustainability agency, and the MPWMD jointly filed a petition for writ of mandate in Monterey County Superior Court against the Coastal Commission, alleging that the Coastal Commission violated the California Coastal Act and the California Environmental Quality Act in issuing a coastal development permit to Cal Am for construction of slant wells for the Water Supply Project. Cal Am is named as a real party in interest. On April 24, 2024, the court granted defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed \none\n of MCWD’s causes of action in the petition. A trial commenced on December 9, 2024, and further proceedings continued in January 2025. This matter remains pending.\n127\nTable of Contents\nFollowing the issuance of the coastal development permit, Cal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining the remaining required permits for the Water Supply Project. However, there can be no assurance that the Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Cal Am has complied with the diversion limitations contained in the 2016 Order. Continued compliance with the diversion limitations in 2025 and future years may be impacted by a number of factors, including without limitation potential recurrence of drought conditions in California and the exhaustion of water supply reserves, and will require successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The Orders remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the Orders may result in material additional costs and obligations to Cal Am, including fines and penalties against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the Orders.\nCal Am’s Action for Damages Following Termination of Regional Desalination Project (“RDP”)\nIn 2010, the CPUC had approved the RDP, which was a precursor to the current Water Supply Project and called for the construction of a desalination facility in the City of Marina. The RDP was to be implemented through a Water Purchase Agreement and ancillary agreements (collectively, the “Agreements”) among MCWD, Cal Am and the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (“MCWRA”). In 2011, due to a conflict of interest concerning a former member of MCWRA’s Board of Directors, MCWRA stated that the Agreements were void, and, as a result, Cal Am terminated the Agreements. In ensuing litigation filed by Cal Am in 2012 to resolve the termination of the RDP, the court in 2015 entered a final judgment agreeing with Cal Am’s position that four of the \nfive\n Agreements are void, and \none\n, the credit line agreement, is not void. As a result of this litigation, Cal Am was permitted to institute further proceedings, discussed below, to determine the amount of damages that may be awarded to Cal Am as a result of the failure of the RDP. \nIn 2015, Cal Am and MCWRA filed a complaint in San Francisco County Superior Court against MCWD and RMC Water and Environment, a private engineering consulting firm (“RMC”), seeking to recover compensatory, consequential and incidental damages associated with the failure of the RDP, as well as punitive and treble damages, statutory penalties and attorneys’ fees. In 2019, MCWD was granted a motion for summary judgment related to the tort claims in the complaint. A settlement as to the non-tort claims was finalized and entered into in March 2020. As part of this settlement, Cal Am’s and MCWRA’s right to appeal the dismissal of their tort claims against MCWD were expressly reserved, and, in July 2020, Cal Am filed its appeal. In December 2022, the trial court’s decision was reversed on appeal with instructions to vacate its prior orders granting MCWD’s motions for summary judgment and to enter new orders denying the motions. In February 2023, MCWD filed a petition for review of the appellate decision with the California Supreme Court, which was denied in March 2023. On June 27, 2024, MCWD filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Following a hearing, on December 5, 2024, the court granted MCWD’s motion without leave to amend, dismissing all of Cal Am’s remaining tort claims. Final judgment was entered on January 7, 2025. Cal Am intends to file a notice of appeal of the trial court’s decision.\nProposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets — Potential Condemnation\nLocal Agency Formation Commission Litigation\nThe water system assets of Cal Am located in Monterey, California (the “Monterey system assets”) are the subject of a condemnation action by the MPWMD stemming from a November 2018 public ballot initiative. In 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey system assets’ total value plus adjustments would be approximately $\n513\n million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. In 2020, the MPWMD certified a final environmental impact report, analyzing the environmental impacts of the MPWMD’s project to (1) acquire the Monterey system assets through the power of eminent domain, if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system.\nIn February 2021, the MPWMD filed an application with the Local Agency Formation Commission of Monterey County (“LAFCO”) seeking approval to become a retail water provider and annex approximately \n58\n parcels of land into the MPWMD’s boundaries. In June 2021, LAFCO’s commissioners voted to require a third-party independent financial study as to the feasibility of an acquisition by the MPWMD of the Monterey system assets. In December 2021, LAFCO’s commissioners denied the MPWMD’s application to become a retail water provider, determining that the MPWMD does not have the authority to proceed with a condemnation of the Monterey system assets. In April 2022, the MPWMD filed a lawsuit against LAFCO challenging its decision to deny the MPWMD’s application seeking approval to become a retail water provider. In June 2022, the court granted, with conditions, a motion by Cal Am to intervene in the MPWMD’s lawsuit against LAFCO. In December 2022, the court sustained in part, and denied in part, demurrers that had been filed by LAFCO seeking to dismiss the MPWMD’s lawsuit. \n128\nTable of Contents\nOn December 11, 2023, the Monterey County Superior Court issued a writ of mandate directing LAFCO to vacate and set aside its original denial of the MPWMD’s application to serve as a retail water provider (in conjunction with its effort to acquire the Monterey system assets) and, if requested, to re-hear the application in compliance with all applicable law. The court held that LAFCO incorrectly applied \ntwo\n statutory standards and noted a lack of sufficient evidence to support certain of LAFCO’s factual findings. As a result, the LAFCO denial has been nullified and LAFCO will be required to hold another hearing on the MPWMD’s application. On February 8, 2024, and February 9, 2024, respectively, Cal Am and LAFCO each filed a notice of appeal with the California Court of Appeal regarding the Monterey County Superior Court’s decision to issue the writ of mandate. The MPWMD filed a notice of cross-appeal on February 15, 2024. Cal Am is evaluating potential additional actions to seek to uphold LAFCO’s denial of the MPWMD’s application, including filing other challenges and/or making suitable presentations at a subsequent LAFCO rehearing.\nMPWMD Condemnation Action\nSeparate from the proceedings related to the MPWMD’s application with LAFCO, by letter dated October 3, 2022, the MPWMD notified Cal Am of a decision to appraise the Monterey system assets and requested access to a number of Cal Am’s properties and documents to assist the MPWMD with such an appraisal. Cal Am responded by letter on October 24, 2022, denying the request for access, stating that the MPWMD does not have the right to appraise Cal Am’s system without LAFCO approval to become a retail water provider. On April 28, 2023, Cal Am rejected an offer by the MPWMD to purchase the Monterey system assets for $\n448.8\n million. Over the written and oral objections of Cal Am, at a hearing held on October 10, 2023, the MPWMD adopted a resolution of necessity to authorize it to file an eminent domain lawsuit with respect to the Monterey system assets. On December 15, 2023, the MPWMD filed a lawsuit against Cal Am in Monterey County Superior Court seeking to condemn the Monterey system assets.\n \nOn February 26, 2024, Cal Am filed a motion requesting the Monterey County Superior Court dismiss the MPWMD’s lawsuit seeking to condemn Cal Am’s Monterey system assets. Cal Am’s motion asserted that the MPWMD lacks legal authorization from both the California legislature and LAFCO to become a retail water provider and the lawsuit improperly seeks to effect a taking of property outside the boundaries of the MPWMD’s territory. Hearings on the motion were held on May 3, 2024, and August 23, 2024. On November 14, 2024, the court issued a final ruling denying Cal Am’s motion to dismiss. Cal Am filed its answer to the complaint on December 13, 2024. This matter remains pending.\nWhile the Company cannot currently predict the outcome of the MPWMD’s eminent domain lawsuit, the Company believes that, given existing legal authorities and its other defenses, Cal Am should be able to defend itself successfully against this lawsuit.\nNote 17: Earnings per Common Share\nPresented in the table below is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for the basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) calculations for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumerator:\n \n \n \nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n1,051\n \n$\n944\n \n$\n820\n \nDenominator:\n \n \n \nWeighted average common shares outstanding—Basic\n195\n \n193\n \n182\n \nEffect of dilutive common stock equivalents\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nWeighted average common shares outstanding—Diluted\n195\n \n193\n \n182\n \nThe effect of dilutive common stock equivalents is related to outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs granted under the Company’s 2007 Plan and outstanding RSUs and PSUs granted under the Company’s 2017 Omnibus Plan, as well as estimated shares to be purchased under the ESPP. Less than \none million\n share-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.\nThe if-converted method is applied to the Notes issued in June 2023 for computing diluted EPS. For all periods presented, there was no dilution resulting from the Notes. See Note 11—Long-Term Debt for additional information relating to the Notes.\n129\nTable of Contents\nNote 18: Fair Value of Financial Information \nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:\nCurrent assets and current liabilities—The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, including revolving credit debt, due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values.\nSecured seller promissory note from the sale of the Homeowner Services Group—The carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the secured seller promissory note, included as part of the consideration from the sale of HOS is $\n795\n million and $\n720\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This amount represents the principal amount owed under the secured promissory seller note, for which the Company expects to receive full payment. The accounting fair value measurement of the secured seller promissory note approximated $\n793\n million and $\n704\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The accounting fair value measurement is an estimate that is reflective of changes in benchmark interest rates. The secured seller promissory note is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. On February 2, 2024, the secured seller promissory note from the sale of HOS was amended to increase the principal amount from $\n720\n million to $\n795\n million, in full satisfaction of a $\n75\n million contingent cash payment, see Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information. As of December 31, 2023, the contingent cash payment was accounted for as a receivable, as the conditions had been satisfied, and its carrying amount, which approximated fair value, was included as a long-term asset in Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPreferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt—The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs that are used to value each instrument. The fair value of long-term debt classified as Level 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3 instruments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs.\nPresented in the tables below are the carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting, and the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments:\nAs of December 31, 2024\n \nCarrying Amount\nAt Fair Value\nL\ne\nvel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nPreferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements\n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \nLong-term debt\n13,155\n \n10,165\n \n1,050\n \n658\n \n11,873\n \nAs of December 31, 2023\n \nCarrying Amount\nAt Fair Value\nL\ne\nvel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nPreferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements\n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \nLong-term debt\n12,190\n \n9,575\n \n1,044\n \n757\n \n11,376\n \nFair Value Measurements\nTo increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities, exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds and money market funds.\n130\nTable of Contents\nLevel 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, commingled investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and fair-value hedges.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs, such as internally-developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds subject to purchase and sale restrictions.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nPresented in the tables below are assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy:\nAs of December 31, 2024\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets:\n \n \n \n \nRestricted funds\n$\n44\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n44\n \nRabbi trust investments\n29\n \n—\n \n—\n \n29\n \nDeposits\n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6\n \nOther investments:\nMoney market and other\n21\n \n—\n \n—\n \n21\n \nFixed-income securities\n88\n \n6\n \n—\n \n94\n \nMark-to-market derivative asset\n—\n \n24\n \n—\n \n24\n \nTotal assets\n188\n \n30\n \n—\n \n218\n \nLiabilities:\n \n \n \n \nDeferred compensation obligations\n34\n \n—\n \n—\n \n34\n \nTotal liabilities\n34\n \n—\n \n—\n \n34\n \nTotal assets\n$\n154\n \n$\n30\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n184\n \nAs of December 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets:\n \n \n \n \nRestricted funds\n$\n34\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n34\n \nRabbi trust investments\n22\n \n—\n \n—\n \n22\n \nDeposits\n8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n8\n \nOther investments:\nMoney market and other\n26\n \n—\n \n—\n \n26\n \nFixed-income securities\n140\n \n6\n \n—\n \n146\n \nTotal assets\n230\n \n6\n \n—\n \n236\n \nLiabilities:\n \n \n \n \nDeferred compensation obligations\n27\n \n—\n \n—\n \n27\n \nMark-to-market derivative liability\n—\n \n8\n \n—\n \n8\n \nTotal liabilities\n27\n \n8\n \n—\n \n35\n \nTotal assets (liabilities)\n$\n203\n \n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n201\n \nRestricted funds—The Company’s restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities and from customers for future services under operation, maintenance and repair projects. \n131\nTable of Contents\nRabbi trust investments—The Company’s rabbi trust investments consist of equity and index funds from which supplemental executive retirement plan benefits and deferred compensation obligations can be paid. The Company includes these assets in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDeposits—Deposits include escrow funds and certain other deposits held in trust. The Company includes cash deposits in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDeferred compensation obligations—The Company’s deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into notional investment accounts. The Company includes such plans in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Company’s deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants’ notional investment accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily of mutual funds, which are based on quoted prices for identical assets in active markets.\nMark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities—The Company employs derivative financial instruments in the form of treasury lock agreements, classified as cash flow hedges, in order to fix the interest cost on existing or forecasted debt. The Company uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows, which are discounted, to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility.\nOther investments—The Company maintains the Active VEBA trust for purposes of paying active union employee medical benefits. The investments in the Active VEBA trust primarily consist of money market funds and available-for-sale fixed-income securities. \nThe money market and other investments have original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The fair value measurement of the money market and other investments is based on quoted prices for identical assets in active markets and therefore included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1. \nThe available-for-sale fixed income securities are primarily investments in U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds. The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain U.S. Treasury securities are based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, and are therefore categorized as Level 2, because the valuations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. \nThe Company includes other investments measured and recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $\n71\n million and $\n62\n million in other current assets, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $\n44\n million and $\n111\n million in other long-term assets, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income until realized.\n132\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize the unrealized positions for available-for-sale fixed income securities:\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAmortized Cost Basis\nGross unrealized gains\nGross unrealized losses\nFair Value\nAvailable-for-sale fixed-income securities\n$\n94\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n94\n \nAs of December 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost Basis\nGross unrealized gains\nGross unrealized losses\nFair Value\nAvailable-for-sale fixed-income securities\n$\n143\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n146\n \nThe fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale fixed income securities, summarized by contractual maturities, as of December 31, 2024, is as follows:\nAmount\nOther investments - Available-for-sale fixed-income securities\nLess than one year\n$\n57\n \n1 year - 5 years\n25\n \n5 years - 10 years\n5\n \nGreater than 10 years\n7\n \nTotal\n$\n94\n \nNote 19: Leases\nThe Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. Certain operating leases have renewal options ranging from \none year\n to \n60\n years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. Renewal options that the Company was reasonably certain to exercise are included in the Company’s ROU assets. Certain operating leases contain the option to purchase the leased property. The operating leases for real property, vehicles and equipment will expire over the next \n40\n years, \nfive years\n, and \nfive years\n, respectively.\nThe Company participates in a number of arrangements with various public entities (“Partners”) in West Virginia. Under these arrangements, the Company transferred a portion of its utility plant to the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”) issued by the Partners under the Industrial Development and Commercial Development Bond Act. The Company leased back the utility plant under agreements for a period of \n30\n to \n40\n years. The Company has recorded these agreements as finance leases in \nproperty, plant and equipment\n, as ownership of the assets will revert back to the Company at the end of the lease term. The carrying value of the finance lease assets was $\n143\n million and $\n144\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company determined that the finance lease obligations and the investments in IDBs meet the conditions for offsetting, and as such, are reported net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and excluded from the lease disclosure presented below.\nThe Company also enters into O&M agreements with the Partners. The Company pays an annual fee for use of the Partners’ assets in performing under the O&M agreements. The O&M agreements are recorded as operating leases, and future annual use fees of $\n4\n million in 2025 through 2029, and $\n37\n million thereafter, are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRental expenses under operating leases were $\n12\n million, $\n11\n million and $\n12\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, cash paid for amounts in lease liabilities, which includes operating cash flows from operating leases, was $\n11\n million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities was $\n11\n million.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining lease term of the operating leases was \n18\n years, and the weighted-average discount rate of the operating leases was \n5\n%.\nThe future maturities of lease liabilities at December 31, 2024, were $\n11\n million in 2025, $\n10\n million in 2026, $\n10\n million in 2027, $\n8\n million in 2028, $\n7\n million in 2029 and $\n86\n million thereafter. At December 31, 2024, imputed interest was $\n47\n million.\n133\nTable of Contents\nNote 20: Segment Information\nThe Company’s operating segments are comprised of its businesses which generate revenue, incur expense and have separate financial information which is regularly used by the chief operating decision maker to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its businesses primarily through \none\n reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The Regulated Businesses segment is the largest component of the Company’s business and includes subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services to customers in \n14\n states. \nThe Company also operates other businesses, primarily MSG, which provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities. These other businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP, and are collectively presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K within “Other,” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies. The Regulated Businesses segment includes intercompany costs that are allocated by Service Company and intercompany interest that is charged by AWCC, both of which are eliminated to reconcile to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inter-segment revenues include the sale of water from a regulated subsidiary to subsidiaries within Other, leased office space, and furniture and equipment provided by subsidiaries within Other to regulated subsidiaries. Other also includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Company’s Regulated Businesses, interest income related to the secured seller promissory note from the sale of HOS, income from assets not associated with the Regulated Businesses, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments related to acquisitions that have not been allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment. The adjustments related to the acquisitions are reported in Other as they are excluded from segment performance measures evaluated by management.\nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The chief operating decision maker uses segment net income or loss to evaluate profit generated from segment assets when making decisions about allocating resources. The chief operating decision maker also uses segment net income to monitor budget versus actual results to assess the performance of the segment.\nPresented in the tables below is summarized segment information as of and for the years ended December 31:\n \n2024\nRegulated\nBusinesses\nOther\nConsolidated\nOperating revenues\n$\n4,296\n \n$\n388\n \n$\n4,684\n \nLess:\nOperation and maintenance (a)\n1,517\n \n341\n \n1,858\n \nOther segment items (b)\n241\n \n9\n \n250\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n772\n \n16\n \n788\n \nInterest expense\n416\n \n107\n \n523\n \nInterest income\n(\n17\n)\n(\n77\n)\n(\n94\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n302\n \n6\n \n308\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\n$\n1,065\n \n$\n(\n14\n)\n$\n1,051\n \nTotal assets\n$\n29,941\n \n$\n2,889\n \n$\n32,830\n \nCapital expenditures\n$\n2,838\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n2,856\n \n(a)\nSignificant segment expense.\n(b)\nOther segment items included in segment net income includes General taxes, Non-operating benefit costs, net, and Other income (expense), net, primarily Allowance for other funds used during construction.\n134\nTable of Contents\n \n2023\nRegulated\nBusinesses\nOther\nConsolidated\nOperating revenues\n$\n3,920\n \n$\n314\n \n$\n4,234\n \nLess:\nOperation and maintenance (a)\n1,441\n \n279\n \n1,720\n \nOther segment items (b)\n220\n \n7\n \n227\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n693\n \n11\n \n704\n \nInterest expense\n364\n \n96\n \n460\n \nInterest income\n(\n28\n)\n(\n45\n)\n(\n73\n)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n259\n \n(\n7\n)\n252\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\n$\n971\n \n$\n(\n27\n)\n$\n944\n \nTotal assets\n$\n27,480\n \n$\n2,818\n \n$\n30,298\n \nCapital expenditures\n$\n2,551\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n2,575\n \n(a)\nSignificant segment expense.\n(b)\nOther segment items included in segment net income includes General taxes, Other operating expenses, Non-operating benefit costs, net, and Other income (expense), net, primarily Allowance for other funds used during construction.\n \n2022\nRegulated\nBusinesses\nOther\nConsolidated\nOperating revenues\n$\n3,505\n \n$\n287\n \n$\n3,792\n \nLess:\nOperation and maintenance (a)\n1,345\n \n244\n \n1,589\n \nOther segment items (b)\n173\n \n11\n \n184\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n633\n \n16\n \n649\n \nInterest expense\n314\n \n119\n \n433\n \nInterest income\n(\n2\n)\n(\n50\n)\n(\n52\n)\nGain on sale of businesses\n—\n \n(\n19\n)\n(\n19\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n188\n \n—\n \n188\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\n$\n854\n \n$\n(\n34\n)\n$\n820\n \nTotal assets\n$\n25,038\n \n$\n2,749\n \n$\n27,787\n \nCapital expenditures\n$\n2,284\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n2,297\n \n(a)\nSignificant segment expense.\n(b)\nOther segment items included in segment net income includes General taxes, Non-operating benefit costs, net, and Other income (expense), net, primarily Allowance for other funds used during construction.\n135\nTable of Contents\nNote 21: Unaudited Quarterly Data\nPresented in the tables below are supplemental, unaudited, consolidated, quarterly financial data for each of the four quarters in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and its directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria described in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBased on the Company’s evaluation under the framework in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\n, its management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company concluded that there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during its last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n137\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION\nChief Executive Officer Succession\nOn February 19, 2025, reflecting the Company’s existing and ongoing executive development and succession planning activities by management and the Board of Directors, Ms. Hardwick, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a director, notified Karl F. Kurz, Board Chair, of her decision to retire as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and principal executive officer, effective as of the conclusion of the Company’s 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “2025 Annual Meeting”).  In her notice, Ms. Hardwick also indicated her decision not to stand for re-election to the Board of Directors at the 2025 Annual Meeting. On February 19, 2025, the Board of Directors accepted Ms. Hardwick’s notice and, upon the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, determined that she would not stand for re-election to the Board of Directors at the 2025 Annual Meeting. Ms. Hardwick’s decision not to stand for re-election to the Board of Directors was not as a result of any disagreement with the Company or the Board of Directors on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.\nOn February 19, 2025, to provide for the orderly succession of Ms. Hardwick’s roles, the Board of Directors designated Mr. Griffith, the Company’s President, to serve as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and as principal executive officer, effective as of the conclusion of the 2025 Annual Meeting, to hold office until the Company’s 2026 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “2026 Annual Meeting”) and until his successor has been elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. Upon the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, the Board of Directors also nominated Mr. Griffith for election to the Board of Directors at the 2025 Annual Meeting, and he will be included among the director nominees of the Board of Directors to be named in the Company’s 2025 Proxy Statement. If elected to the Board of Directors by the shareholders of the Company, Mr. Griffith would serve until the Company’s 2026 Annual Meeting and until his successor has been elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal, and would not serve on any committee of the Board of Directors. See Item 1—Business—Information About Our Executive Officers, for more information about Mr. Griffith’s business experience.\nOther than existing compensatory arrangements between Mr. Griffith and the Company as described in the Company’s 2024 Proxy Statement, in connection with his succession: (i) there are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Griffith and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Griffith was designated or nominated to serve in his new roles, (ii) no material plan, contract or arrangement has been entered into with Mr. Griffith, and no such plan, contract or arrangement with Mr. Griffith has been materially amended, and (iii) no grant of any award to Mr. Griffith or modification of an existing award has been made.  Mr. Griffith does not have any family relationship with any director or other executive officer of the Company, or any person nominated or chosen by the Company to become a director or executive officer, and does not have any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction in which the Company is or is to be a participant and which would require reporting under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.\nIn connection with Ms. Hardwick’s retirement, the ED&CC recommended, based on the advice of its independent compensation consultant, and the independent members of the Board of Directors approved, in addition to Ms. Hardwick’s customary executive compensation for 2025 (which was consistent with her executive compensation for 2024), a discretionary cash payment to Ms. Hardwick of $800,000, less all applicable withholdings and deductions, in recognition of her outstanding service and performance in the role as Chief Executive Officer.\nBoard of Directors Committee Changes\nAs part of its annual 2025 committee review process and to appropriately distribute director responsibilities, on February 19, 2025, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, appointed director Stuart M. McGuigan to serve on the ED&CC and the SETO Committee, and determined that director Patricia L. Kampling will no longer serve on the SETO Committee, each of which actions took effect immediately.\nAdoption or Termination of Rule 10b5-1 Plans and Non-Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or “officers” (as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n (i) any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of the Company’s securities, intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).\nITEM 9C.    DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\n138\nTable of Contents\nPART III\nITEM 10.    DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe information required by this item and not set forth below or in Item 1—Business—Information About Our Executive Officers of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is incorporated by reference from the Company’s Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, to be filed with the SEC within 120 days following the end of the fiscal year covered by this report, under the captions entitled “Board of Directors and Corporate Governance” and “Proposal 1—Election of Directors.”\nThe Company has adopted a Code of Ethics, which applies to directors, officers and employees.
