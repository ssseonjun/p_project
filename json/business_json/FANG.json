    "item1": "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\nThe nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities. Other risks are described in Items 1 and 2. “Business and Properties,” Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” These risks are not the only risks we face. We could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline.\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results:\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\n•\nMarket conditions and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas may adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth, production and the present value of our estimated reserves.\n•\nOur commodity price derivatives could result in financial losses, may fail to protect us from declines in commodity prices, prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty credit risk.\n•\nThe IRA and other risks relating to climate change could accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and could impose new costs on our operations that may have a material and adverse effect on us.\n•\nClimate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives may have other adverse effects, such as a greater potential for governmental investigations or litigation.\n•\nWe may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all to fund our acquisitions or development activities, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves and future production. \n•\nOur failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings, and title defects in the properties in which we invest may lead to losses.\n•\nOur identified potential drilling locations are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\n•\nIf production from our Permian Basin acreage decreases, we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contract, which may adversely affect our operations.\n•\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations, or loss of one or more of our significant purchasers, may adversely affect our financial results.\n•\nOur method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value. \n•\nAny material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\n•\nWe are vulnerable to risks associated with our primary operations concentrated in a single geographic area.\n•\nIf transportation or other facilities, certain of which we do not control, or rigs, equipment, raw materials, oil services or personnel are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\n•\nOur operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive and may impose restrictions on our operations.\n•\nU.S. tax legislation, including recently adopted IRA, may negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\n•\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.\n•\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business and could adversely affect our business.\n•\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. \n•\nFollowing the closing of the Endeavor Acquisition, the Endeavor equityholders have the ability to significantly influence our business, and their interest in our business may be different from that of other stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n•\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness, and we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future.\n•\nThe significant additional indebtedness incurred in connection with the Endeavor Acquisition may limit our operating or financial flexibility relative to our current position and make it difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our other indebtedness.\n23\nTable of Contents\n•\nImplementing our capital programs may require, under some circumstances, an increase in our total leverage through additional debt issuances, and any significant reduction in availability under our revolving credit facility or inability to otherwise obtain financing for our capital programs could require us to curtail our capital expenditures.\n•\nRestrictive covenants in certain of our existing and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.\n•\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for dividends and other payments.\n•\nIf we experience liquidity concerns, we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\n•\nBorrowings under our and Viper LLC’s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk. \nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n•\nThe declaration of dividends and any repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors, and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends on or repurchases of our common stock in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders.\n•\nThe market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the Endeavor Acquisition.\n•\nA change of control could limit our use of net operating losses.\n•\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\n•\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nMarket conditions for oil and natural gas, and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas, have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth, production and the present value of our estimated reserves.\nOur revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; the level of prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas; the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of foreign imports; political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia; the potential impact of the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas War and other conflicts in the Middle East on the global energy markets and macroeconomic conditions; the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East; the ability of members of the OPEC+ to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts; the level of consumer product demand; extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters; risks associated with operating drilling rigs; technological advances affecting energy consumption; the price and availability of alternative fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including the new administration’s energy and environmental policies; global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease; the proximity, cost, availability and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and overall domestic and global economic conditions. Our results of operations may also be adversely impacted by any future government rule, regulation or order that may impose production limits, as well as pipeline capacity and storage constraints, in the Permian Basin where we operate.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. From the beginning of 2022 through the end of 2024, NYMEX WTI prices ranged from $65.75 to $123.70 per Bbl and the NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas ranged from $1.58 to $9.68 per MMBtu. If the prices of oil and natural gas decline, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected. \nPrimarily as a result of our Endeavor Acquisition, the Viper Tumbleweed Acquisitions, and the pending Double Eagle Acquisition, if consummated, we expect to increase our fourth quarter 2024 production levels in 2025. We cannot reasonably predict whether production levels will remain at current levels or the full extent of the impact of the events above and any subsequent recovery may have on our industry and our business.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIf commodity prices fall below current levels, we may be required to record impairments in future periods and such impairments could be material. Further, if commodity prices decrease, our production, proved reserves and cash flows will be adversely impacted. Reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, which could limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities.\nOur commodity price derivatives could result in financial losses, may fail to protect us from declines in commodity prices, prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and\n \nmay\n \nexpose us to other risks, including counterparty credit risk.\nWe use commodity price derivatives, which have historically included swaps, basis swaps, swaptions, roll hedges, costless collars, puts and basis puts, to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas sales. Currently, we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2025 and 2026 production. To the extent that the prices of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further, we may not be able to economically hedge additional future production at the same level as our current commodity price derivatives, and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted. While these commodity price derivatives are intended to mitigate risk from commodity price volatility, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in the prices of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas above the price levels of the commodity price derivatives used to manage price risk.\nAt settlement, market prices for commodities may exceed the contract prices in our commodity price derivatives agreements, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties. Further, by using commodity derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to credit risk if we are in a positive position at contract settlement and the counterparty fails to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We do not require collateral from our counterparties. \nFor additional information regarding our outstanding derivative contracts as of December 31, 2024, see Note 13—\nDerivatives\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, \nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n and \nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n—Commodity Price Risk of this report.\nThe IRA and other risks relating to climate change could accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and could impose new costs on our operations that may have a material and adverse effect on us.\nGovernmental and regulatory bodies, investors, consumers, industry and other stakeholders have been increasingly focused on climate change matters in recent years. This focus, together with changes in consumer and industrial/commercial behavior, preferences and attitudes with respect to the generation and consumption of energy, the use of hydrocarbons, and the use of products manufactured with, or powered by, hydrocarbons, may result in; (i) the enactment of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives by governments, investors, and other companies, including alternative energy or “zero carbon” requirements and fuel or energy conservation measures; (ii) technological advances with respect to the generation, transmission, storage and consumption of energy (including advances in wind, solar and hydrogen power, as well as battery technology); (iii) increased availability of, and increased demand from consumers and industry for, energy sources other than oil and natural gas (including wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal sources as well as electric vehicles); and (iv) development of, and increased demand from consumers and industry for, lower-emission products and services (including electric vehicles and renewable residential and commercial power supplies) as well as more efficient products and services.\nAny of these developments may reduce the demand for products manufactured with (or powered by) hydrocarbons and the demand for, and in turn the prices of, the oil and natural gas that we produce and sell, which would likely have a material adverse impact on us.\nIf any of these developments reduce the desirability of participating in the oilfield services, midstream or downstream portions of the oil and gas industry, then these developments may also reduce the availability to us of necessary third-party services and facilities that we rely on, which could increase our operational costs and adversely affect our ability to explore for, produce, transport and process oil and natural gas and successfully carry out our business and financial strategy. The enactment of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives may also result in increases in our compliance costs and other operating costs and have other adverse effects, such as a greater potential for governmental investigations or litigation.\nIn recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the IRA include billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, investments in advanced biofuels and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration. Also, in March 2024, the EPA finalized ambitious rules to reduce harmful air pollutant emissions, including greenhouse gases, from light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles beginning in \n25\nTable of Contents\nmodel year 2027. These incentives and regulations could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, the oil and natural gas that we produce and sell and adversely impact our business. In addition, the IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of greenhouse gases through a methane emissions charge, which could increase our operating costs and thereby adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed multiple executive orders seeking to reverse these climate incentives, including pausing the disbursement of funds under the IRA. The same day, President Trump also issued executive orders to encourage fossil fuel production and exploration on federal lands and waters, while moving away from incentivizing renewable energy and electric vehicles. It is unclear what effect those actions will have.\nIn addition to potentially reducing demand for our oil and natural gas and potentially reducing the availability of oilfield services and midstream and downstream customers, any further regulatory or other climate change incentives, to the extent they continue, may create reputational risks associated with the exploration for, and production of, hydrocarbons, which may adversely affect the availability and cost to us of capital. For example, in recent years, certain stakeholders and capital providers sought to restrict or seek more stringent conditions with respect to their investment in or financing of certain carbon intensive sectors. If financial institutions and other investors refuse to invest in or provide capital to the oil and gas sector in the future because of these reputational risks, that could result in capital being unavailable to us, or only at significantly increased costs.\nFor further discussion regarding the risks to us of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives, please see the section entitled \nItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties\n—Regulation—Climate Change of this report.\nChanging political and social perspectives on climate change and other environmental, social and governance factors may create risks and uncertainties impacting our business.\nIn recent years, increased attention to global climate change resulted in increased investor attention and an increased risk of public and private litigation. Further, shareholders have sought to effect changes to public companies’ businesses or governance to deal with climate change-related issues through shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or other actions. Any such future actions may result in significant management distraction and potentially significant expense. \nAdditionally, cities, counties, and other governmental entities in several states in the U.S. have filed lawsuits against energy companies seeking damages allegedly associated with climate change. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. If any such lawsuits were to be filed against us, whether due to our activities or the activities of the acquired entities or operations prior to their acquisition by us, we could incur substantial legal defense costs and, if any such litigation were adversely determined, we could incur substantial damages. \nAny of these climate change-related litigation risks could result in unexpected costs, negative sentiments about our company, disruptions in our operations, and increases to our operating expenses, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur targets related to sustainability and emissions reduction initiatives, including our public statements and disclosures regarding them, may expose us to numerous risks.\nWe have developed, and will continue to develop, targets related to our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives, including our emissions reduction targets and strategy. Statements in this and other reports we file with the SEC and other public statements related to these initiatives reflect our current plans and expectations and are not a guarantee the targets will be achieved or achieved on the currently anticipated timeline. Our ability to achieve our ESG targets, including emissions reductions, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control, and failure to achieve our announced targets or comply with ethical, environmental or other standards, including reporting standards, may expose us to government enforcement actions or private litigation and adversely impact our business. Further, our continuing efforts to research, establish, accomplish and accurately report on these targets may create additional operational risks and expenses and expose us to reputational, legal and other risks. \nESG expectations, including both the matters in focus and the management of such matters, as well as perspectives on the efficacy of ESG considerations, continue to evolve, and we cannot currently predict how regulators’, investors’ and other stakeholders’ views on ESG matters may affect the regulatory and investment landscape and affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, in response to the evolving regulatory environment and investor expectations, or due to our acquisitions of other companies or assets, we may, periodically, make adjustments to our environmental targets or goals. If we do not, or are perceived to not, adapt or comply with investor or stakeholder expectations and standards on ESG matters, we may suffer from reputational damage and our business, financial condition \n26\nTable of Contents\nand results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any reputational damage associated with ESG factors may also adversely impact our ability to recruit and retain employees and customers.\nThe SEC published final rules on March 28, 2024, relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks and other information. Several lawsuits have been filed challenging the rules. In April 2024, the SEC agreed to pause the rules to facilitate an orderly judicial resolution. To the extent the rules are implemented, we and/or our customers could incur increased costs related to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related information.\nIt is unclear what effect recent executive orders by President Trump will have on investor and other stakeholders’ near-term and long-term ESG expectations for companies involved in fossil fuel exploration and production.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income. \nA significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. In addition, many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and to maintain the production in paying quantities, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells and maintaining such production, we could lose our rights under such leases. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage. \nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production in paying quantities is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any reduction in our current drilling program, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations. Any non-renewal or other loss of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves. \nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. In 2024, our total capital expenditures, including expenditures for drilling, completion, infrastructure and additions to midstream assets, were approximately $2.9 billion. Our 2025 capital budget, which gives effect to the pending Double Eagle Acquisition, for drilling, completion, infrastructure and midstream, including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects, is currently estimated to be approximately $3.80 billion to $4.20 billion, representing an increase of 40% from our 2024 capital expenditures. Since completing our initial public offering in October 2012, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash generated by operations, the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and our senior notes and sales of non-core assets.\nWe intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, while future acquisitions may also be funded from operations as well as proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including our proved reserves; the volume of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells; the prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold; our ability to acquire, locate and produce economically new reserves; and our ability to borrow under our credit facility.\nWe cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. Further, our actual capital expenditures in 2025 could exceed our \n27\nTable of Contents\ncapital expenditure budget. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include traditional reserve base borrowings, debt financing, joint venture partnerships, sales of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. \nIf we are unable to fund our capital requirements or our costs of capital increase, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan, complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. In addition, a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings. \nOur success depends on finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves. \nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. To increase reserves and production, we undertake development, exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities. If we are unable to replace our current production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Furthermore, although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly, our finding and development costs for additional reserves could also increase.\nOur failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth.\nThere is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves, future oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials, operating costs, and potential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain, and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, including title defects or environmental issues, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Environmental or other regulatory issues may arise with respect to acquired entities or operations years after the acquisitions. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.\nCompetition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. If these acquisitions include geographic regions in which we do not currently operate, we could be subject to unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities. In addition, if we enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such additional legal requirements. Further, the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our financial position and results of operations may also fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOur identified potential drilling locations, which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans, are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have approximately 9,188 gross (7,130 net) identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately $50.00 per Bbl WTI. As of December 31, 2024, only 1,381 of our gross identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in which we have a working interest were attributed to proved reserves. These drilling locations, including those without proved undeveloped reserves, represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, construction of infrastructure, unusual or unexpected geological formations, title problems, facility or equipment malfunctions, unexpected operational events, inclement weather, environmental and other regulatory requirements and approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs, drilling results and the availability of water. Further, our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we have identified approximately 1,657 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells, which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours. We cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. Through December 31, 2024, we are the operator of, have participated in, or have acquired working interest in a total of 6,590 horizontal producing wells completed on our acreage. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations. Further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the Permian Basin may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf production from our Permian Basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities, production related difficulties or otherwise, we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contracts, which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are a party to long-term crude oil agreements under which, subject to certain terms and conditions, we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to our counterparties. Our maximum delivery obligation under these agreements varies for different periods and depends in some cases upon certain conditions beyond our control. If production from our Permian Basin acreage decreases due to reduced developmental activities, as a result of the low commodity price environment, production related difficulties or otherwise, we may be unable to meet our obligations under our oil purchase agreements, which may result in deficiency payments to certain counterparties or a default under such agreements and may have an adverse effect on our company.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production. Joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill. We are generally unable to control which co-owners participate in our wells.\nWe are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. See \nItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties\n—Marketing and Customers of this report for additional information regarding these customers. This concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by any adverse changes in economic and other conditions. We do not require our customers \n29\nTable of Contents\nto post collateral. Under certain circumstances, the revenue due to them can be offset by any unpaid receivables. The inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results.\nOur method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value.\nWe account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting. Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. We also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment.\nThe net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. We use the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12-month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues.\nNo impairments were recorded on our proved oil and natural gas properties for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. See \nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates\n—Oil and Natural Gas Accounting and Reserves of this report. If the prices of oil and natural gas decline, we may be required to further write-down the value of our oil and natural gas properties in the future, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur estimated reserves and EURs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nOil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves, projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. The EURs for our horizontal wells are based on management’s internal estimates. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. Also, certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices, production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows. A substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves.\nThe standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves, or standardized measure may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board Codification 932, “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas,” may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate.\nApproximately 33% of our total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2024, were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling and completion operations. The reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves.\nOur producing properties are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks (including weather-related risks) associated with operating in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area.\nOur producing properties are currently geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids, and extreme weather conditions and their adverse impact on production volumes, availability of electrical power, road accessibility and transportation facilities. \nExtreme regional weather events may occur that can affect our suppliers or customers, which could adversely affect us. For example, a significant hurricane or similar weather event could damage refining and other oil and natural gas-related facilities on the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, which (if significant enough) could limit the availability of gathering and transportation facilities across Texas and could then cause production in the Permian Basin (including potentially our production) to be curtailed or shut in or (in the case of natural gas) flared. Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of significant weather events over time. Further, any increase in flaring of our natural gas production due to weather-related events or otherwise could make it difficult for us to achieve our publicly-announced sustainability and emissions reduction targets, which could expose us to reputational risks and adversely impact our contractual and other business relationships. Any of the above-referenced events could have a material adverse effect on us and our production volumes (and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations).\nIn addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the Permian Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above, as of December 31, 2024, most of our proved reserves are concentrated in the Wolfberry play in the Midland Basin. This concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.\nWe depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. The loss of one or more of these purchasers could, among other factors, limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nThe availability of a ready market for any oil and/or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including those discussed. We cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production. In addition, we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. See \nItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties\n—Marketing and Customers of this report for additional information regarding these customers. The loss of one or more of these customers, and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe unavailability, high cost or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies, oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations. \nThe oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. When shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies increase and demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. In accordance with customary industry practice, we rely on independent third-party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells. If we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire. In addition, we do not have long-term contracts securing the use of our existing rigs, and the operators of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us. Shortages of any of the items referenced above could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations, which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations. Over the past several years, Texas has experienced extreme drought conditions. As a result of this severe drought, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. Also, in 2021, the Texas Legislature directed the Texas Railroad Commission to adopt rules encouraging fluid oil and gas waste recycling. On January 3, 2025, the Commission published final amendments to its water protection rules to, among other things, encourage waste recycling. The revised rules will go into effect on July 1, 2025. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water, we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecent regulatory restrictions on the disposal of produced water and additional monitoring and reporting requirements related to existing and new produced water disposal wells in the Permian Basin to stem rising seismic activity and earthquakes could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn September 2021, the Texas Railroad Commission curtailed the amount of produced water companies were permitted to inject into some wells near Midland and Odessa in the Permian Basin, and has since indefinitely suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas. These actions were taken in an effort to control induced seismic activity and recent increases in earthquakes in the Permian Basin, which have been linked by the U.S. and local seismologists to wastewater disposal in oil fields. The Texas Railroad Commission has since adopted rules governing the permitting or re-permitting of wells used to dispose of produced water and other fluids resulting from the production of oil and gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the state to modify, suspend or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. These restrictions and additional monitoring and reporting requirements related to existing and new produced water and produced water disposal wells could result in increased operating costs, requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or dispose of it by other means, all of which could be costly. We or our service providers may also need to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates and pressures or locations, or require us or our service providers to shut down or curtail the injection of produced water into disposal wells. These factors may make drilling activity in the affected parts of the Permian Basin less economical and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques; therefore, the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.\nOur operations involve developing and utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, spacing of wells to maximize economic return; landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone; staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation; running our casing the entire length of the well bore; and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages; run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations; successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage; and prevent unintentional communication with other wells.\nFurthermore, certain of the new techniques we are adopting, such as infill drilling and multi-well pad drilling, may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to, in the case of infill drilling, offset wells being shut in and, in the case of multi-well pad drilling, the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. The results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, and/or declines in natural gas and oil prices, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which we do not control. If these facilities are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties. We do not control third-party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied. Insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third-party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. For example, on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the Permian Basin. If, in the future, we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties, we may be required to shut in or curtail production. In addition, the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control, such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance, excessive pressure, ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we are provided with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any such shut in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. In addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation, remediation, emission and disposal of oil and natural gas, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. Further, these laws and regulations imposed strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us. In addition, federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. Even if federal regulatory burdens temporarily ease, the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations may continue in the long-term, and at the state and local levels. See \nItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties\n—Regulation of this report for a detailed description of certain laws and regulations that affect us.\n33\nTable of Contents\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered, such as the recent designation of lesser prairie chickens in southwestern Texas and the dunes sagebrush lizard in southeast New Mexico and west Texas as endangered, could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nDerivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the SEC, and certain federal regulators of financial institutions (Prudential Regulators), to adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act established margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities. Although some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued a number of rules, including rules requiring clearing of certain swaps through registered clearing facilities (Mandatory Clearing Rule), requiring the posting of collateral for uncleared swaps (Margin Rule) and imposing position limits (Position Limit Rule). There are exceptions, subject to meeting certain filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, to the Mandatory Clearing Rule, the Margin Rule and the Position Limit Rule.\nWe qualify for the “end user” exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule and the “non-financial end user” exception to the Margin Rule and we believe that the majority, if not all, of our hedging activities qualify for the “bona fide hedging transaction or position” exception to the Position Limit Rule. We intend to satisfy the applicable filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements to use these exceptions, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules. However, most if not all of our swap counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing and collateral requirements in connection with their hedging activities with other counterparties that do not qualify for exceptions to these rules, which could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts or reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations (collectively, Foreign Regulations), which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations (Foreign Counterparties). The Foreign Regulations, the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated and other regulations could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Foreign Regulations or other regulations, our results of operations and cash flows may become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nU.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our\n \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nFrom time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting the oil and natural gas industry, including (i) eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, \n34\nTable of Contents\nwhat the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. These proposed changes in the U.S. tax law, if adopted, or other similar changes that would impose additional tax on our activities or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration, development or similar activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which, among other changes, imposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on the “adjusted financial statement income” of certain large corporations (generally, corporations reporting more than $1 billion average adjusted pre-tax net income on their consolidated financial statements) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. While we are subject to CAMT, we did not incur a CAMT liability for 2024.\nThe IRA also imposes an excise tax of 1% on the fair market value of certain public company stock repurchases occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation, and the amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the aggregate fair market value of the stock repurchased during the taxable year. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. To the extent the 1% excise tax applies to repurchases of shares under our common stock repurchase program, the number of shares we repurchase and our cash flow may be affected.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies are expected to issue additional guidance on how CAMT, stock buyback excise tax and other provisions of the IRA will be applied or otherwise administered that may differ from our interpretations. We continue to evaluate the IRA and its effect on our financial results and operating cash flow.\nWe operate in areas of high industry activity, which may affect our ability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets.\nOur operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the Permian Basin in West Texas, an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly. As a result, demand for qualified personnel in this area, and the cost to attract and retain such personnel, has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. Moreover, our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer.\nAny delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes. Any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team could disrupt our operations. We do not have employment agreements with our executives and may not be able to assure their retention. Further, we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nOperating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits.\nOur operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. In addition, our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWe endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods, which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing, drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface, intermediate and production casing. Under our agreements with our vendors, to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties, (i) our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and (ii) we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations, including pre-existing pollution and pollution which may result from fire, blowout, cratering, seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil, gas or other substances, as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids. In addition, we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendor-owned property that occurs in the well hole (except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage, rather than day work, basis) or as a result of the use of equipment, certain corrosive fluids, additives, chemicals or proppants. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice, we historically have maintained insurance against some, but not all, of our business risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer. Also, insurance may no longer be available to us or, if it is, its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. We may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance.\nSince hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, we maintain insurance to protect against claims made for bodily injury and property damage, and that insurance includes coverage for clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. However, we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. We have limited coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events. In addition, these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities, and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.\nWe own interests in certain pipeline projects and other joint ventures, and we may in the future enter into additional joint ventures, and our control of such entities is limited by provisions of the governing documents of such entities and by our percentage ownership in such entities.\nWe have ownership interests in several joint ventures, and we may enter into other similar arrangements in the future. While we own equity interests and have certain voting rights with respect to our ownership interest, we do not control our joint ventures. We have limited ability to influence the business decisions of these entities, and it may therefore be difficult or impossible for us to cause the joint venture to take actions that we believe would be in our or the relevant joint venture’s best interests. Moreover, joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties, such as committing us to fund operating and/or capital expenditures, the timing and amount of which we may not control. In addition, our joint venture partners may not satisfy their financial obligations to the joint venture and may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, or those of the joint venture.\nWe are also unable to control the amount of cash we receive from the operation of these entities. Further, certain of these joint ventures have incurred substantial debt and servicing such debt or complying with debt covenants may limit the \n36\nTable of Contents\nability of the joint ventures to make distributions to us and the other joint venture partners. These joint ventures also have internal control environments independent of our oversight and review. If our joint venture partners have control deficiencies in their accounting or financial reporting environments, it may result in inaccuracies in the reporting for our percentage of the financial results of the joint venture.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nOur operations depend heavily on electrical power, internet and telecommunication infrastructure and information and computer systems. If any of these systems are compromised or unavailable, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are heavily dependent on electrical power, internet and telecommunications infrastructure and our information systems and computer-based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such infrastructure, systems or programs were to fail or become unavailable or compromised, or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, our ability to safely and effectively operate our business will be limited and any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nAs an exploration and production company, we rely extensively on information technology systems, including internally developed software, data hosting platforms, real-time data acquisition systems, third-party software, cloud services and other internally or externally hosted hardware and software platforms, to (i) estimate our oil and natural gas reserves, (ii) process and record financial and operating data, (iii) process and analyze all stages of our business operations, including exploration, drilling, completions, production, transportation, pipelines and other related activities and (iv) communicate with our employees and vendors, suppliers and other third parties. Further, our reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of personal devices, remote communications and work-from-home or hybrid work practices that evolved in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and became a common business practice thereafter.\nRisks from cybersecurity threats have not materially affected, and are not currently anticipated to materially affect our company, including our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition. However, our systems and networks, and those of our vendors, service providers and other third-party providers, may become the target of cybersecurity attacks, including, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks; malicious software; data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. Security incidents can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, such as physical theft. More recently, advancements in artificial intelligence (“AI”) may pose serious risks for many of the traditional tools used to identify individuals, including voice recognition (whether by machine or the human ear), facial recognition or screening questions to confirm identities. In addition, generative AI systems may also be used by malicious actors to create more sophisticated cyber-attacks (i.e., more realistic phishing or other attacks). The advancements in AI could lead to an increase in the frequency of identity fraud or cyberattacks (whether successful or unsuccessful), which could cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel, protection technologies and policies and procedures, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. If any of these security breaches were to occur, \n37\nTable of Contents\nwe could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, including our exploration, completion, production and corporate functions, which could materially and adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, unauthorized access to, and release of, our business data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information, which could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources, or reduce our competitive advantage over other companies; data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions during our drilling activities, which could result in our failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident; data corruption or operational disruptions of our production-related infrastructure, which could result in loss of production or accidental discharges; unauthorized access to, and release of, personal information of our employees, vendors, service providers, royalty and working interest owners, or other third parties, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect such information; a cybersecurity attack on a vendor, service provider or other business partner, which could result in supply chain disruptions and could delay or halt our operations; a cybersecurity attack on third-party gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining or other facilities, which could result in reduced demand for our production or delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production, in either case resulting in a loss of revenues; a cybersecurity attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues; a deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could then lead to regulatory enforcement actions, fines or penalties; a cybersecurity attack on a communications network or power grid, which could cause operational disruptions resulting in a loss of revenues; and a cybersecurity attack on our automated and surveillance systems, which could cause a loss of production and potential environmental hazards.\nWe have implemented and invested in, and will continue to implement and invest in, controls, procedures and protections (including internal and external personnel) that are designed to protect our systems, identify and remediate on a regular basis vulnerabilities in our systems and related infrastructure and monitor and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity threat. We have engaged third-party consultants to conduct penetration testing and risk assessments. Our cybersecurity governance program is informed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework and measured by the Maturity and Risk Assessment Ratings associated with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the Capability Maturity Model Integration. Such measures, however, cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats and the controls, procedures and protections we have implemented and invested in may prove to be ineffective. We maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets, however, we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nEvolving privacy-related laws could give rise to liabilities, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA variety of U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of personal data. All 50 states have enacted legislation on data breach notification requirements and many states continue to enact laws on matters of privacy, data protection and cybersecurity. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. In addition, various U.S. federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies continue to enact new laws regarding privacy and data protection, as well as expand the scope of existing laws. For example, Texas recently passed the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, which establishes new laws for collecting, storing, processing, and selling consumer information. Several other states, such as California, Utah, Colorado, Virginia, Connecticut, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, among others, have proposed or passed legislation regarding data privacy and use. We cannot predict the impact of any such evolving privacy-related laws on our business, operations or financial condition, but may find it necessary to enhance our existing systems and procedures, which may involve substantial expense or distraction from other aspects of our business. In addition, any violations of applicable privacy-related laws or regulations may require us to address legal claims, sustain monetary penalties or incur other liabilities, as well as cause reputational damage, any of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFollowing the closing of the Endeavor Acquisition, the Endeavor equityholders have the ability to significantly influence our business, and their interest in our business may be different from that of other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Endeavor’s equityholders held approximately 36% of our common stock. Pursuant to an agreement with the Endeavor equityholders (the “Stockholders Agreement), the Company appointed three additional directors to our board of directors of the Company at closing of the Endeavor Acquisition. We will not be permitted to take certain actions without the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock held by the Endeavor equityholders. The Endeavor equityholders’ level of ownership and influence may make some transactions (such as those involving mergers, material share issuances or changes in control) more difficult or impossible, which in turn could adversely \n38\nTable of Contents\naffect the market price of our shares of common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock. The interests of the Endeavor equityholders may conflict with the interests of other stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nReferences in this section to “us, “we” or “our” shall mean Diamondback Energy, Inc. and Diamondback E&P LLC, collectively, unless otherwise specified.\nServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including our senior notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. However, we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations. In the absence of such cash flows, we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe significant additional indebtedness incurred in connection with the Endeavor Acquisition, as well as additional indebtedness that may be incurred in connection with future acquisitions, may limit our operating or financial flexibility and make it difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our other indebtedness.\nWe incurred a substantial amount of debt to finance the cash consideration of the Endeavor Acquisition and to repay certain existing indebtedness of Endeavor. Additionally, from time to time we may incur additional indebtedness in connection with other acquisitions in the future. Our increased level of debt could have negative consequences on us, including, among other things, (i) requiring us to dedicate a larger portion of cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of the debt, (ii) reducing funds available for strategic initiatives and opportunities, working capital and other general corporate needs, (iii) limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which could restrict our flexibility to react to changes in our business, our industry and economic conditions and (iv) placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nWe and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our and our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities and the indentures restrict, but in each case do not completely prohibit, us from doing so. Further, the indentures governing our and our subsidiaries’ notes allow us to issue additional notes, incur certain other additional debt and to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt, which would be structurally senior to the senior notes. In addition, the indentures governing the senior notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. If we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes (or with the guarantees thereof), including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables, the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of us or a guarantor. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nImplementing our capital programs may require, under some circumstances, an increase in our total leverage through additional debt issuances, and any significant reduction in availability under our revolving credit facility or inability to otherwise obtain financing for our capital programs could require us to curtail our capital expenditures.\nWe have historically relied on availability under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. We expect that we will continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures with borrowings under the revolving credit facility, cash flow from operations and the proceeds from debt and equity offerings. In the past, we have \n39\nTable of Contents\ncreated availability under the revolving credit facility by repaying outstanding borrowings with the proceeds from debt or equity offerings. We cannot assure you that we will choose to or be able to access the capital markets to repay any such future borrowings. Instead, we may be required or choose to finance our capital expenditures through additional debt issuances, which would increase our total amount of debt outstanding. If the availability under the revolving credit facility were reduced, and we were otherwise unable to secure other sources of financing, we may be required to curtail our capital expenditures, which could limit our ability to fund our drilling activities and acquisitions or otherwise finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves.\nRestrictive covenants in certain of our existing and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.\nCertain of our debt instruments contain, and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; make certain investments; create liens; sell or transfer assets; issue preferred stock; merge or consolidate with another entity; pay dividends or make other distributions; create unrestricted subsidiaries; and engage in transactions with affiliates. A breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under the applicable debt instrument.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants and financial covenants contained in our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments. As an example, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a total net debt to capitalization ratio. The requirement that we and our subsidiaries comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our and our subsidiaries ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.\nIf a default occurs under our revolving credit facility, the lenders thereunder may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes. The lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness.\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for dividends and other payments.\nAs a holding company, we depend on our subsidiaries for dividends and other payments. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness.\nIf we experience liquidity concerns, we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nOur ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs.\nBorrowings under our and Viper LLC’s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our and Viper LLC’s revolving credit facilities. The terms of our and Viper LLC’s revolving credit facilities provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternate base rate tied to the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”). SOFR tends to fluctuate based on multiple factors, including general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks and general economic conditions. From time to time, we use interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate exposure with respect to our fixed and/or floating rate debt. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 6.33% during the year ended December 31, 2024. Viper LLC’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its \n40\nTable of Contents\nrevolving credit facility was 7.34% during the year ended December 31, 2024. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe declaration of base and variable dividends and any repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations, and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders.\nThe decision to pay any future base and variable dividends is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors. Our board of directors’ determination with respect to any such dividends, including the record date, the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend, will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination. Based on its evaluation of these factors, the board of directors may determine not to declare a dividend, whether base or variable, or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated, either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders.\nIn September 2024, our board of directors approved an increase in our common stock repurchase program to acquire up to $6.0 billion. We may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock by various governmental laws, rules and regulations which prevent us from purchasing our common stock during periods when we are in possession of material non-public information. Through December 31, 2024, approximately $3.3 billion has been repurchased through the repurchase program. Even though this program is in place, we may not repurchase any shares through the program and any such repurchases are completely within the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, the stock repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued by the board of directors at any time. Any elimination of, or reduction in, the Company’s base or variable dividend or common stock repurchase program could adversely affect the total return of an investment in and have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, our board of directors approved a reduction to our return of capital commitment to at least 50% (down from 75%) of free cash flow to be distributed quarterly to our stockholders in the primary form of a base dividend with additional return of capital expected to be in the form of a variable dividend and through our stock repurchase program. The amount of cash available to return to our stockholders, if any, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter for a number of reasons, including commodity prices, liquidity, debt levels, capital resources and other factors. The price of our common stock may deteriorate if we are unable to meet investor expectations with respect to the timing and amount of our return of capital commitment to our shareholders, and such deterioration may be material.\nThe market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the Endeavor Acquisition and the pending Double Eagle Acquisition.\nAt closing, we entered into the Stockholders Agreement with the Endeavor equityholders that, among other things, provided the Endeavor equityholders with certain shelf, demand and piggyback registration rights. While the Endeavor equityholders are subject to a lock-up with respect to 90% of the shares of our common stock issued in the Endeavor Acquisition, the lock-up will apply to 66.6% and 33.3% of the shares issued in the Endeavor Acquisition following March 10, 2025 and September 10, 2025, respectively, and will terminate following March 10, 2026. Additionally, if the pending Double Eagle Acquisition is consummated, we will issue approximately 6.9 million shares of our common stock to the seller. Endeavor equityholders and Double Eagle equityholders may decide not to hold shares of our common stock that they received in the Endeavor Acquisition and Double Eagle Acquisitions, respectively, and may decide to reduce their investment in us. Such sales of our common stock or the perception that these sales may occur, could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock. \nA change of control could limit our use of net operating losses and certain other tax attributes.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a corporation that experiences an “ownership change” (as defined in the Code) may be subject to limitations on its ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with net operating losses (“NOLs”) or tax credits generated prior to the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase in the ownership of a corporation’s stock totaling more than 50 percentage points by one or more “5% shareholders” (as defined in the Code) at any time during a rolling three-year period. An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of a corporation’s pre-change NOLs or tax credits that could be utilized to offset taxable income in any future taxable year. The amount of the limitation is generally equal to the value of the corporation’s stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by an interest rate, referred \n41\nTable of Contents\nto as the long-term tax-exempt rate, periodically promulgated by the IRS. This limitation, however, may be significantly increased if there is “net unrealized built-in gain” in the assets of the corporation undergoing the ownership change.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had an NOL carryforward of approximately $538 million and tax credits of $4 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes, principally consisting of tax attributes acquired from QEP Resources, Inc. (“QEP”) and Rattler. As a result of ownership changes for Diamondback Energy, Inc., QEP and Rattler, which occurred in connection with the acquisition of QEP and the Rattler Merger, our NOLs and other carryforwards, including those acquired from QEP and Rattler, are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code. However, we have determined that our fair market value and our net unrealized built-in gain position resulted in a significant increase in our Section 382 limits. Accordingly, we believe that the application of Section 382 of the Code as a result of these ownership changes will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to utilize our NOLs and credits.\nFuture changes in our stock ownership, however, could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Any such ownership change may limit our ability to offset taxable income arising after such an ownership change with NOLs or other tax attributes generated prior to such an ownership change, possibly substantially.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders; limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent; the ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our bylaws; the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors; the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to amend our certificate of incorporation; and the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.",

CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity Risk Management Strategy\nWe have implemented and invested in, and will continue to implement and invest in, controls, procedures and protections (including internal and external personnel) that are designed to protect our systems, identify and remediate on a regular basis vulnerabilities in our systems and related infrastructure and monitor and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity threats. \nWe have engaged third-party consultants to conduct penetration testing and risk assessments.\n Our cybersecurity program is informed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity \n42\nTable of Contents\nFramework and measured by the Maturity and Risk Assessment Ratings associated with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the Capability Maturity Model Integration.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n•\nrisk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT and operational technology, or OT, environments;\n•\na security team principally responsible for managing (i) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (ii) our security controls, and (iii) our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n•\nthe use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test, train or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;\n•\nsecurity tools deployed in the IT and OT environments for protection against and monitoring for suspicious activity;\n•\ncybersecurity awareness training of our employees, including incident response personnel and senior management; \n•\ncybersecurity tabletop exercises for members of our cybersecurity incident response team and legal department;\n•\na cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and\n•\na third-party risk management process for service providers, suppliers and vendors.\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur cybersecurity governance program is led by the \nSenior Vice President and Chief Information Officer\n, with support from the internal information technology department.\n \nThe Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer has over 20 years of technological leadership experience in the oil and gas industry, providing oversight of all information technology disciplines, including cybersecurity, networking, infrastructure, applications, and data management and protection. The Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer and his team, which consists of individuals who hold designations as Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), CompTIASecurity+, and Department of Defense (DoD)-Cybersecurity General, are responsible for leading enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, architecture and processes.\n In addition, our cybersecurity incident response team is responsible for responding to cybersecurity incidents in accordance with our Computer Security Incident Response Plan. \nProgress and developments in our cybersecurity governance program are communicated to members of the executive team. Our management team takes steps to remain informed about and monitor efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including third-party consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT and OT environments.\n While our board of directors is ultimately responsible for enterprise-wide risk oversight, the board’s committees assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. \nIn particular, the board’s audit committee is responsible, among other things, for risk management relating to legal and regulatory requirements, including cybersecurity, which plays an integral role in our risk management strategy and continues to be an area of increasing focus for our board, the audit committee and our management team.\nThe audit committee of the \nboard of directors\n receives quarterly updates on the status of our cybersecurity governance program, including as related to new or developing initiatives and any security incidents that may occur. \nBoard members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from the Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer as part of the board’s continuing education on topics that impact public companies.\n Further, our code of business conduct and ethics expects all employees to safeguard our electronic communications systems and related technologies from theft, fraud, unauthorized access, alteration or other damage and requires them to report any cyberattacks or incidents, improper access or theft to our Chief Legal and Administrative Officer and the Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer. Our cybersecurity governance program also includes processes to assess cybersecurity risks related to third-party service providers, suppliers and vendors. Our vendor management process may include reviewing the cybersecurity practices of such provider, contractually imposing obligations on the provider, conducting security assessments and conducting periodic reassessments during their engagement.\nRisks from cybersecurity threats have not materially affected, and are not currently anticipated to materially affect, our Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\n See, however,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n of this report above. In order to mitigate this volatility, we enter into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions, all of which are participants in our credit facility, to economically hedge a portion of our estimated future crude oil and natural gas production as discussed further in Note 13—\nDerivatives\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and \nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n—Commodity Price Risk\n \nof this report. The level of our hedging activity and duration of the financial instruments employed depend on our desired cash flow protection, available hedge prices, the magnitude of our capital program and our operating strategy.\nCash Flow \nOur cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented below: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n6,413 \n$\n5,920 \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n(11,221)\n(3,323)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n4,387 \n(2,176)\nNet change in cash\n$\n(421)\n$\n421 \nOperating Activities \nOur operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce. \nThe increase in operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily resulted from (i) an increase of $1.8 billion in total revenue, excluding sales of purchased oil, (ii) an additional $138 million in interest income, and (iii) a reduction of $59 million in cash paid on settlements of derivatives. These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in our cash operating expenses, excluding purchased oil expense, of \n57\nTable of Contents\napproximately $903 million related primarily to merger and integration costs incurred in connection with the Endeavor Acquisition and additional lease operating expenses, (ii) an increase of $253 million in cash paid for taxes, (iii) an increase of $123 million in cash paid for interest, net of capitalized amounts, and (iv) fluctuations in other working capital balances due primarily to the timing of when collections were made on accounts receivable and payments were made on accounts payable. See “\n—\nResults of Operations\n” for discussion of significant changes in our revenues and expenses.\nInvesting Activities \nThe majority of our net cash used for investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was for drilling and completion costs in conjunction with our development program as well as the purchase of oil and gas properties including the Endeavor Acquisition and Viper’s Tumbleweed Acquisitions in 2024 and the Lario Acquisition and Viper’s GRP Acquisition in 2023. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds received from the divestitures of various oil and gas properties and other assets, which are discussed further in Note 4—\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. \nCapital Expenditure Activities\nOur capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and equity method investments (on a cash basis) were as follows for the specified period:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nDrilling, completions and non-operated additions to oil and natural gas properties\n$\n2,632 \n$\n2,429 \nInfrastructure additions to oil and natural gas properties\n221 \n153 \nAdditions to midstream assets\n14 \n119 \nTotal\n$\n2,867 \n$\n2,701 \nFor further discussion regarding our development program, please see \nItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties\n—Oil and Natural Gas Data—Wells Drilled and Completed in 2024 of this report.\nFinancing Activities \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $5.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the April 2024 Notes, $900 million in borrowings on our Tranche A Loans, net of repayments, $476 million in proceeds from the Viper 2024 Equity Offering, $451 million in proceeds from the sale of our shares of Viper’s Class A common stock and $2 million in borrowings on our credit facilities, net of repayments. These cash inflows were partially offset by (i) $1.6 billion of dividends paid to stockholders, (ii) $959 million of repurchases as part of the share repurchase program, (iii) $227 million in dividends to non-controlling interest, (iv) $99 million of debt issuance costs primarily associated with the April 2024 Notes, Term Loan Agreement and Bridge Facility, and (vi) $39 million in cash paid for tax withholdings on vested employee stock awards.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to (i) $1.4 billion of dividends paid to stockholders, (ii) $935 million of repurchases as part of the Diamondback and Viper share repurchase programs, (iii) $134 million paid for the retirement of outstanding principal on certain senior notes, and (iv) $129 million in distributions to non-controlling interest. The cash outflows were partially offset by (i) $394 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the Viper 2031 Notes and an additional $111 million in borrowings under credit facilities, net of repayments.\nCapital Resources\nOur working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We may draw on our revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program and to finance the pending Double Eagle Acquisition. Because of the alternatives available to us, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term capital requirements.\n58\nTable of Contents\nAs we pursue our business and financial strategy, we regularly consider which capital resources, including cash flow and/or equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. Our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. Any prolonged volatility in the capital, financial and/or credit markets and/or adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit our access to, or increase our cost of, capital or make capital unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. \nRevolving Credit Facilities and Other Debt Instruments \nAs of December 31, 2024, our debt, including the debt of Viper, consisted of approximately $12.0 billion in aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior notes, $900 million in aggregate outstanding short-term borrowings under the Tranche A Loans and $261 million in aggregate outstanding borrowings under revolving credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the maximum credit amount available under our credit agreement was $2.5 billion, which may be increased to a total maximum commitment amount of $2.6 billion, with no outstanding borrowings and $2.5 billion available for future borrowings. Our credit agreement matures on June 2, 2029. \nViper LLC’s Credit Agreement\nThe Viper LLC credit agreement, as amended to date, matures on September 22, 2028 and provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of $2.0 billion, with a borrowing base and elected commitment amount of $1.3 billion. At December 31, 2024, there were $261 million of outstanding borrowings and $1.0 billion available for future borrowings under the Viper LLC credit agreement. \nFor additional discussion of our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2024, see Note 9—\nDebt\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nDebt Ratings\nWe receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the U.S which impact the interest rates we receive on our variable rate debt and interest rate swaps. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and production growth opportunities.  In September, we received an upgrade from two of the three major ratings agencies in the U.S., Standard and Poor’s Global Ratings Services and Fitch Investor Services. Currently, our credit ratings from the three main credit rating agencies are as follows:\n•\nStandard and Poor’s Global Ratings Services (BBB);\n•\nFitch Investor Services (BBB+); and\n•\nMoody’s Investor Services (Baa2). \nAny rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements.\nCapital Requirements\nIn addition to future operating expenses and working capital commitments discussed in “—\nOutlook\n”,\n our primary short and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of (i) capital expenditures, (ii) payments of principal and interest on our revolving credit agreements, Tranche A Loans and senior notes, (iii) payments of other contractual obligations, (iv) cash commitments for dividends and repurchases of securities, and the pending Double Eagle Acquisition.\n2025 Capital Spending Plan\n    We currently estimate that our 2025 capital budget, which gives effect to the pending Double Eagle Acquisition, will be $3.80 billion to $4.20 billion, including $3.13 billion to $3.44 billion for horizontal drilling and completions, $280 million to $320 million for non-operated activity and capital workovers and $390 million to $440 million spent on infrastructure, midstream and environmental capital expenditures. We currently expect to drill approximately 446 to 471 gross (406 to 428 net) horizontal wells and complete approximately 557 to 592 gross (526 to 560 net) horizontal wells across our operated and non-operated leasehold acreage in the Northern Midland and Southern Delaware Basins, with an average lateral length of approximately 11,500 feet.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control. We could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners. We will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence and our capital expenditure budget up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions.\nPayments of Principal and Interest on Senior Notes and Tranche A Loans\nAt December 31, 2024, we have total principal payments due on our outstanding senior notes, including those of Viper, of $764 million in 2026, $1.3 billion in 2027, $73 million in 2028, $915 million in 2029 and $9.0 billion thereafter. Additionally, we expect to incur future cash interest costs on these senior notes of approximately $612 million in 2025, $1.2 billion cumulatively in the years from 2026 through 2027, $1.0 billion cumulatively in the years from 2028 and 2029, and $7.1 billion cumulatively between 2030 and 2064.\nIn addition to the senior notes, we have $900 million in aggregate outstanding borrowings under the Tranche A Loans due in 2025. See Note 9—\nDebt\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for further discussion on the Tranche A Loans.\nOther Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2024, our other significant contractual obligations consist primarily of (i) minimum transportation commitments totaling $2.8 billion, (ii) electrical power purchase commitments totaling $365 million (iii) asset retirement obligations totaling $592 million, (iv) electric fracturing fleet and related power generation services commitments totaling $199 million and (v) minimum purchase commitments for quantities of sand used in our drilling operations totaling $66 million. We expect to make aggregate payments of approximately $442 million for these commitments during 2025. See Note 7—\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n and Note 16—\nCommitments and Contingencies\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for further discussion of these and other contractual obligations and commitments.\nWe and Five Point Energy LLC currently anticipate collectively contributing $500 million in follow-on capital to fund future growth in our Deep Blue Midland Basin LLC joint venture projects and acquisitions.\nReturn of Capital Commitment\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, our board of directors approved a return of capital commitment of at least 50% (down from 75%) of our quarterly free cash flow to our stockholders through repurchases under our share repurchase program, base dividends and variable dividends. The remainder of our free cash flow will be used primarily to reduce debt. On February 21, 2025, our board of directors declared a base cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2024 of $1.00 per share of common stock. \nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. As used by us, free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital in excess of cash capital expenditures and other adjustments as determined by us. We believe that free cash flow is useful to investors as it provides a measure to compare both cash flow from operating activities and additions to oil and natural gas properties across periods on a consistent basis.\nFuture base and variable dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors, and the board of directors may change the dividend amount from time to time based on our outlook for commodity prices, liquidity, debt levels, capital resources, free cash flow and other factors. We can provide no assurance that dividends will be authorized or declared in the future or as to the amount and type of any future dividends. Any future dividends, whether base or variable, if declared and paid, will by their nature fluctuate based on our free cash flow, which will depend on a number of factors beyond our control, including commodity prices.\nOn September 18, 2024, our board of directors approved an increase in our common stock repurchase program from $4.0 billion to $6.0 billion, excluding excise tax. Since the inception of the stock repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate 25.84 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $3.5 billion, excluding excise tax, as of February 21, 2025. Subject to regulatory restrictions and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, we intend to continue opportunistically purchasing shares under this repurchase program primarily with funds from cash flow from operations and liquidity events such as the sale of assets while maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund our capital expenditure \n60\nTable of Contents\nprograms. See Note 10—\nStockholders' Equity and Earnings (Loss) Per Share\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for further discussion of the repurchase program.\nGuarantor Financial Information\nDiamondback E&P is the sole guarantor under the indentures governing the outstanding Guaranteed Senior Notes. \nGuarantees are “full and unconditional,” as that term is used in Regulation S-X, Rule 3-10(b)(3), except that such guarantees will be released or terminated in certain circumstances set forth in the indentures governing the Guaranteed Senior Notes, such as, with certain exceptions, (i) in the event Diamondback E&P (or all or substantially all of its assets) is sold or disposed of, (ii) in the event Diamondback E&P ceases to be a guarantor of or otherwise be an obligor under certain other indebtedness, and (iii) in connection with any covenant defeasance, legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the relevant indenture. \nDiamondback E&P’s guarantees of the Guaranteed Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of its future subordinated indebtedness, equal in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness, including its obligations under its revolving credit facility, and effectively subordinated to any of its existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.\nThe rights of holders of the Guaranteed Senior Notes against Diamondback E&P may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit Diamondback E&P’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of Diamondback E&P. Moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for Diamondback Energy, Inc., as the parent, and Diamondback E&P, as the guarantor subsidiary, on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between the parent and the guarantor subsidiary, and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor. The information is presented in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13-01 under the SEC’s Regulation S-X. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the guarantor subsidiary operated as an independent entity.\nDecember 31, 2024\nSummarized Balance Sheets:\n(In millions)\nAssets:\nCurrent assets\n$\n933 \nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n21,795 \nOther noncurrent assets\n$\n32 \nLiabilities:\nCurrent liabilities\n$\n2,943 \nIntercompany accounts payable, non-guarantor subsidiary\n$\n3,381 \nLong-term debt\n$\n10,978 \nOther noncurrent liabilities\n$\n2,979 \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nSummarized Statement of Operations:\n(In millions)\nRevenues\n$\n7,022 \nIncome (loss) from operations\n$\n2,319 \nNet income (loss)\n$\n1,631 \n61\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. \nCertain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. \nWe consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.\nOil and Natural Gas Accounting and Reserves\nWe account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting, which is dependent on the estimation of proved reserves to determine the rate at which we record depletion on our oil and natural gas properties and whether the value of our evaluated oil and natural gas properties is permanently impaired based on the quarterly full cost ceiling impairment test. Further, we utilize estimated proved reserves to assign fair value to acquired proved oil and natural gas properties including mineral and royalty interests. As such, we consider the estimation of proved reserves to be a critical accounting estimate. \nOil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Proved oil and natural gas reserve estimates and their associated future net cash flows were prepared by our internal reservoir engineers and audited by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., independent petroleum engineers as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. Significant inputs included in the calculation of future net cash flows include our estimate of operating and development costs, anticipated production of proved reserves and other relevant data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time, and reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. If such changes are material, they could significantly affect future depletion of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material. Revisions of previous reserve estimates accounted for approximately $2.0 billion, or 16% of the change in the standardized measure of our total reserves from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. No impairments were recorded for our proved oil and gas properties during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Based on the historical 12-month average trailing SEC prices for oil and natural gas throughout 2024 and into 2025, we are not currently projecting a full cost ceiling impairment in the first quarter of 2025. \nAdditionally, costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. We assess all items classified as unevaluated property (on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant) at least annually for possible impairment. This assessment is subjective and includes consideration of the following factors, among others: (i) intent to drill, (ii) remaining lease term, (iii) geological and geophysical evaluations, (iv) drilling results and activity, (v) the assignment of proved reserves, and (vi) the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. At December 31, 2024, our unevaluated properties totaled $22.7 billion, which consisted of 433,335 net undeveloped leasehold acres with approximately 4,290 net acres set to expire in 2025. We did not record any impairment on our unevaluated properties during the year ended December 31, 2024, but any such future impairment could potentially be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n62\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations in which it has been determined we are the acquirer using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values.\nWe make various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Fair value estimates are determined based on information that existed at the time of the acquisition, utilizing expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant. When market-observable prices are not available to value assets and liabilities, the Company may use the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management’s assumptions.\nThe most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. The assumptions made in performing these valuations include future production volumes, future commodity prices and costs, future operating and development activities, projections of oil and gas reserves and a weighted average cost of capital rate. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. In addition, when appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of natural gas and oil properties within the same regions, and use that data as a proxy for fair market value; for example, the amount a willing buyer and seller would enter into in exchange for such properties. Changes in key assumptions may cause the acquisition accounting to be revised, including the recognition of goodwill or discount on an acquisition. There is no assurance the underlying assumptions or estimates associated with the valuation will occur as initially expected. See Note 4—\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n and Note 5—\nEndeavor Energy Resources, LP Acquisition\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for further discussion of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations including any significant changes in these estimates from the date of acquisition.\nEstimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. In addition, differences between the future commodity prices when acquiring assets and the historical 12-month average trailing price to calculate ceiling test impairments of upstream assets may impact net earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nThe amount of income taxes we record requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, and local tax jurisdictions. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized after considering all positive and negative evidence available concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Positive evidence may include forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and any applicable tax planning strategies available to the Company. Negative evidence may include losses in recent years, if any, or the projection of losses in future periods. The assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required, entails that we make estimates of, and assumptions about, future events, including the pattern of reversal of taxable temporary differences and our future income from operations. Estimating future taxable income requires numerous judgments and assumptions, including projections of future operating conditions which may be impacted by volatile future prices for our oil, natural gas and natural gas production, the expected timing and quantity of future production volumes, and the impact of our commodity derivative instruments on our income.\nIn 2024, management’s assessment of all available evidence, both positive and negative, supporting realizability of Viper’s deferred tax assets as required by applicable accounting standards, resulted in the full release of Viper’s remaining valuation allowance of $156 million. The positive evidence assessed included recent cumulative income due in part to commodity prices remaining consistently high, acquisitions of additional oil and gas properties, and an expectation of future taxable income based upon recent actual and forecasted production volumes and prices. As of December 31, 2024, Viper had a deferred tax asset of $185 million. Any changes in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if Viper’s deferred tax assets will be realized, including projected future income, could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2024, our balance of taxable temporary differences anticipated to reverse within the carryforward period provides significant positive evidence for the determination that our remaining deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized.\n63\nTable of Contents\nThe accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on unclear tax positions and assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. These assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. At December 31, 2024, we had no uncertain tax positions, however, material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2—\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n in Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for a discussion of our significant commitments and contingencies, some of which are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets under GAAP.\nITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nCommodity Price Risk \nOur major market risk exposure in our exploration and production business is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production. Pricing for oil and natural gas production can be volatile and unpredictable. We cannot predict events, including the outcome of the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, along with other conflicts in the Middle East, changes in interest rates and inflation and global supply chain disruptions, that may lead to future price volatility. We cannot predict events that may lead to future price volatility and the near-term energy outlook remains subject to heightened levels of uncertainty. Further, the prices we receive for production depend on many other factors outside of our control.\nWe use derivatives, including swaps, basis swaps, roll swaps, costless collars, puts and basis puts, to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales. At December 31, 2024, we had a net asset of $145 million related to our commodity price risk derivatives. Utilizing actual contractual volumes under our commodity price derivatives as of December 31, 2024, a 10% increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net asset position by $15 million to $130 million, while a 10% decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net asset derivative position by $36 million to $181 million. However, any cash derivative gain or loss may be substantially offset by a decrease or increase, respectively, in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument.\nFor additional information on our open commodity derivative instruments at December 31, 2024, see Note 13—\nDerivatives\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nCounterparty and Customer Credit Risk \nOur principal exposures to credit risk are due to the concentration of receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production (approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024), and to a lesser extent, receivables resulting from joint interest receivables (approximately $188 million at December 31, 2024). Joint interest receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill. We have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells. We do not require our customers to post collateral, and the failure or inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us due to their liquidity issues, bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.\n64\nTable of Contents\nInterest Rate Risk \nWe are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities, Tranche A Loans and changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt. Outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a per annum rate elected by Diamondback E&P. At December 31, 2024, the applicable margin ranges from 0.125% to 1.000% per annum in the case of the alternate base rate, and from 1.125% to 2.000% per annum in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case based on the pricing level for both our revolving credit facilities and Tranche A Loans. The pricing level depends on certain rating agencies’ ratings of our long-term senior unsecured debt. We are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.325% per year on the unused portion of the commitment for our revolving credit facilities. For our Tranche A Loans, we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee equal to 0.125% per year on the aggregate principal amount of the commitments. We believe significant interest rate changes would not have a material near-term impact on our future earnings or cash flows. For additional information on our variable interest rate debt at December 31, 2024, see Note 9—\nDebt\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nHistorically, we have at times used interest rates swaps to manage our exposure to (i) interest rate changes on our floating-rate date, and (ii) fair value changes on our fixed rate debt. At December 31, 2024, we have interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $900 million to manage the impact of changes to the fair value of our fixed rate senior notes due to changes in market interest rates through December 2029. We pay an average variable rate of interest for these swaps based on three-month SOFR plus 2.1865% and receive a fixed interest rate of 3.50% from our counterparties. At December 31, 2024, our receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps were in a net liability position of $124 million, and the weighted average variable rate was 6.43%. For additional information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 13—\nDerivatives\n in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n65\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.

(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \nEstimation of proved reserves as it relates to the calculation and recognition of depletion expense and the valuation of acquired reserves in connection with the acquisition of Endeavor’s oil and natural gas properties and proved reserves in connection with the Viper Tumbleweed Acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests\nAs described further in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for its oil and natural gas properties using the full cost method of accounting, which requires management to make estimates of proved reserve volumes and future revenues to record depletion expense. Additionally, as described in Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired significant oil and natural gas properties and mineral and royalty interests during the year through the Endeavor and Viper Tumbleweed Acquisitions, respectively. To estimate the volume of reserves and future revenues, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasting the timing and volumetric amounts of production and corresponding decline rate of producing properties associated with the Company’s development plan. In addition, the estimation of reserves is impacted by management’s judgments and estimates regarding the financial performance of wells to determine if wells are expected, with reasonable certainty, to be economical under the appropriate pricing assumptions.  For acquired reserves, management utilizes an estimated fair value pricing model in determining the corresponding value of reserves. We identified the estimation of reserves attributable to oil and natural gas properties, \n67\nTable of Contents\nincluding acquired proved and unproved reserves in the Endeavor Acquisition and acquired proved reserves in the Viper Tumbleweed Acquisitions, due to its impact on depletion expense and acquisition accounting, as a critical audit matter. \nThe principal consideration for our determination that the estimation of reserves is a critical audit matter is that changes in certain inputs and assumptions, which require a high degree of subjectivity, necessary to estimate the volume and future revenues of the Company’s reserves, could have a significant impact on the measurement of depletion expense and the fair value of acquired oil and natural gas properties including mineral and royalty interests. In turn, auditing those inputs and assumptions required subjective and complex auditor judgment.\nOur audit procedures related to the estimation of reserves included the following, among others.\n•\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls relating to management’s estimation of reserves for the purpose of calculating depletion expense and management’s estimation of the fair value of the acquired oil and natural gas properties in the Endeavor and Viper Tumbleweed Acquisitions.\n•\nWe evaluated the level of knowledge, skill, and ability of the Company’s reservoir engineering specialists and independent petroleum engineering specialists, made inquiries of those reservoir engineers regarding the process followed and judgments made to estimate the Company’s reserve volumes, and read the report of the Company’s independent petroleum engineering specialists. \n•\nIdentified inputs and assumptions that were significant to the period end determination of proved reserve volumes and tested management’s process of determining the significant inputs and assumptions, as follows:\n◦\nCompared the estimated pricing and pricing differentials used in the reserve report to realized prices related to revenue transactions recorded in the current year for the pricing differentials;\n◦\nAssessed the reasonableness of forecasted capital expenditures by comparing drilling forecasts applied in the reserve report to recent drilling costs;\n◦\nVouched, on a sample basis, the working and net revenue interests used in the reserve report to underlying land and division order records;\n◦\nAssessed forecasted production estimates by (i) comparing prior year forecasted production amounts to current year actual results and (ii) comparing forecasted production amounts in the current year reserve report to the actual historical production amounts in the current year, in total and for a sample of individual wells;\n◦\nObtained evidence supporting the amount of development of proved undeveloped properties reflected in the reserve report and compared future development plans to historical conversion rates to evaluate the likelihood of development related to the proved undeveloped properties; and\n◦\nApplied analytical procedures on inputs to the reserve report by comparing to historical actual results and to the prior year reserve report.\n•\nIdentified inputs and assumptions that were significant to the estimated fair value of the acquired oil and natural gas properties in the Endeavor and Viper Tumbleweed Acquisitions and tested management’s process of determining the significant inputs and assumptions, as follows:\n◦\nEvaluated the appropriateness of fair value pricing, including pricing differentials, used in the fair value reserve reports by comparing the pricing forecast to published product pricing as of the acquisition closing dates and pricing differentials to actual historical realized pricing of the acquired properties; \n◦\nEvaluated the level of knowledge, skill and ability of specialists utilized by the Company to assist in the preparation of the estimates of fair value of oil and natural gas properties acquired;\n◦\nUtilized a valuation specialist to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company’s valuation methodology of the Endeavor Acquisition, including testing key inputs and assumptions by understanding and assessing the process used to develop the estimate or through development of an independent expectation;\n68\nTable of Contents\n◦\nEvaluated the appropriateness of the discount rate used in the Tumbleweed Acquisitions fair value reserve reports of proved reserves by comparing to Viper’s actual weighted average cost of capital;\n◦\nEvaluated the appropriateness of the future operating cost and capital expenditure assumptions used in the Endeavor Acquisition fair value reserve report by comparing forecasted amounts to historical operating costs and to recent drilling costs;\n◦\nCompared, on a sample basis, the working interest, as applicable, and net revenue interests used in the fair value reserve reports to the purchase and sale agreements or historical reserve reports;\n◦\nTested the accuracy of forecasted production estimates in the fair value reserve reports by comparing forecasted production amounts to the actual historical production amounts and to the forecasted production in the year-end reserve report for a sample of individual wells;\n◦\nApplied analytical procedures on the fair value reserve reports’ forecasted production by comparing to the prior year reserve reports’ forecasted production and to the year-end reserve reports’ forecasted production of the acquired proved properties; and\n◦\nCompared the unproved acreage value allocated to other recent acquisitions in the same or similar locations.\n/s/ \nGRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma\nFebruary 26, 2025 \n69\nTable of

Diamondback include Diamondback E&P LLC (“Diamondback E&P”), a Delaware limited liability company, Rattler Midstream GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Rattler’s GP”), Rattler Midstream LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Rattler”), QEP Resources, Inc. (“QEP”), a Delaware corporation and Eclipse Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.\nRattler Merger\nOn August 24, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), the Company completed a merger with Rattler pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the approximately \n38.51\n million publicly held outstanding common units of Rattler in exchange for approximately \n4.35\n million shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Rattler Merger”). Rattler continued as the surviving entity. Following the Rattler Merger, the Company owns all of Rattler’s outstanding common units and Class B units, and Rattler’s GP remains the general partner of Rattler. Following the closing of the Rattler Merger, Rattler’s common units were delisted from Nasdaq and Rattler filed a certification on Form 15 with the SEC requesting the deregistration of its common units and suspension of Rattler’s reporting obligations under the Exchange Act.\nThe Rattler Merger was accounted for as a non-cash equity transaction resulting in increases to common stock of $\n44\n thousand, additional paid-in-capital of $\n344\n million, merger and integration expense of $\n11\n million and a decrease in noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries of $\n344\n million. For periods prior to the Effective Date, the results of operations attributable to the non-controlling interest in Rattler are presented within equity and net income and are shown separately from the equity and net income attributable to the Company.\nViper Conversion to Corporate Structure\nOn November 13, 2023, the Company’s publicly traded subsidiary, Viper Energy Partners LP, completed its conversion from a Delaware limited partnership into a Delaware corporation, Viper Energy, Inc. (“Viper”) (the “Viper Conversion”). At the time of the Viper Conversion, each of the Company’s common units representing limited partnership interest in Viper Energy Partners, LP was converted, on a unit-for-unit basis, into \none\n issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common stock of Viper, and each of the Company’s Class B units representing a limited partnership interest in Viper Energy Partners, LP was converted, on a unit-for-unit basis, into \none\n issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable share of Class B common stock of Viper. At the time of the Viper Conversion, Viper was a “controlled company” under the Nasdaq rules because the Company owned more than 50% of the voting power of Viper’s common stock.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. \nViper is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. On October 31, 2023, pursuant to a common unit purchase and sale agreement entered into on September 4, 2023, Viper issued approximately \n7.22\n million of its common units, which were converted to shares of Viper Class A common stock at the time of the Viper Conversion, to the Company at a price of $\n27.72\n per unit for total consideration to Viper of approximately $\n200\n million. On March 5, 2024, the Company exercised certain of its demand rights, pursuant to a registration rights agreement initially entered into on June 23, 2014, as amended and restated on May 9, 2018 and November 10, 2023, and on March 8, 2024, completed a public offering of approximately \n13.23\n million of Viper’s Class A common stock at a price of $\n35.00\n per share for proceeds, net of underwriters’ discount, of approximately $\n451\n million. After this offering, the Company owned less than \n50\n% of Viper’s combined outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, resulting in Viper no longer being a controlled \n74\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\ncompany under the Nasdaq rules. Following the completion of the \nViper 2024 Equity Offering\n (as defined and discussed in Note 10—\nStockholders' Equity and Earnings (Loss) Per Share\n) the Company’s ownership of Viper’s voting securities was further reduced to approximately \n45\n%. However, the Company determined, in each case, that it still controls the activities of Viper in accordance with the guidance for variable interest entities in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810— “Consolidation” and therefore continues to consolidate Viper in the Company’s financial statements at December 31, 2024. See further discussion of the Company’s determination that Viper is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) in Note 2—\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company owned approximately \n45\n% of Viper’s combined outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The results of operations attributable to the non-controlling interest in Viper are presented within equity and net income and are shown separately from the equity and net income attributable to the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company is managed as \none\n operating and reportable segment, the upstream segment, which is engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas and includes the activities of Viper as well as the Company’s remaining midstream operations. Prior to the Rattler Merger, both the upstream operations segment and the midstream operations segment were considered reportable segments. Following the Rattler Merger, the midstream operations segment no longer met the quantitative threshold for a reportable segment, but was considered an operating segment. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) no longer receives separate financial information for Rattler due to its insignificance to the Company after further midstream asset divestitures, and Rattler is no longer considered to be an operating segment. As of December 31, 2024, the Company determined only the upstream segment met the quantitative requirements of a reportable segment and an operating segment.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had an immaterial effect on the previously reported total assets, total liabilities, stockholders’ equity, results of operations or cash flows.\n2.    \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates \nCertain amounts included in or affecting the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts the Company reports for assets and liabilities and the Company’s disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMaking accurate estimates and assumptions is particularly difficult in the oil and natural gas industry, given the challenges resulting from volatility in oil and natural gas prices. For instance, the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war and other conflicts in the Middle East, global supply chain disruptions, recent measures to combat persistent inflation and instability in the financial sector have contributed to recent economic and pricing volatility. The financial results of companies in the oil and natural gas industry have been impacted materially as a result of these events and changing market conditions. Such circumstances generally increase the uncertainty in the Company’s accounting estimates, particularly those involving financial forecasts.\nThe Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Any effects on the Company’s business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom, the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties, fair value estimates of derivative instruments, the fair value determination of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and estimates of income taxes, including deferred tax valuation allowances.\n75\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and money market funds to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any significant losses from such investments.\n \nAccounts Receivable \nAccounts receivable consist of receivables from joint interest owners on properties the Company operates and from sales of oil and natural gas production delivered to purchasers. The purchasers remit payment for production directly to the Company. Most payments for production are received within \nthree months\n after the production date. \nAccounts receivable are stated at amounts due from joint interest owners or purchasers, net of an allowance for expected losses as estimated by the Company when collection is doubtful. For receivables from joint interest owners, the Company typically has the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings. Accounts receivable from joint interest owners or purchasers outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance for each type of receivable utilizing the loss-rate method, which considers a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the debtor’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off specific accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for expected losses.\n At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s allowances for credit losses related to joint interest receivables and credit losses related to sales of oil and natural gas production were not material.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company is required to recognize its derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value with such amounts classified as current or long-term based on their anticipated settlement dates. The accounting for the changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. For commodity derivative instruments and interest rate swaps which have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes, the Company marks its derivative instruments to fair value and recognizes the cash and non-cash change in fair value on derivative instruments for each period in the consolidated statements of operations. To the extent that contracts with the same counterparty are allowed to be netted upon payment subject to a master netting arrangement, these amounts are reported on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheets. From the second quarter of 2021 through the second quarter of 2022, the Company had certain interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges under the “shortcut” method of accounting. As such, gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps during those periods completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company elected to fully dedesignate these interest rate swaps and hedge accounting was discontinued.\n For additional information regarding the Company’s derivative instruments, see Note 13—\nDerivatives\n.\nOil and Natural Gas Properties \nThe Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all acquisition, exploration and development costs, including certain internal costs, are capitalized and amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves. Internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other internal costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities. Costs, including related employee costs, associated with production and operation of the properties are charged to expense as incurred. All other internal costs not directly associated with exploration and development activities are charged to expense as they are incurred. Sales of oil and natural gas properties, whether or not being amortized currently, are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil, natural gas and natural liquids. Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method, whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves. The average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was $\n12.60\n, $\n10.21\n and $\n8.87\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Depletion \n76\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nexpense for oil and natural gas properties was $\n2.8\n billion, $\n1.7\n billion and $\n1.3\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, the Company is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of the proved oil and natural gas properties. Net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized oil and natural gas properties net of deferred income taxes, or the cost center ceiling. The cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of (a) estimated future net revenues, discounted at \n10\n% per annum, from proved reserves, based on the trailing 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month price, adjusted for any contract provisions, and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet, (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, if any, and (c) the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized, including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties. If the net book value, including related deferred taxes, exceeds the ceiling, an impairment or non-cash write-down is required. For additional information on proved oil and natural gas properties, see Note 6—\nProperty and Equipment\n.\nCosts associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until the Company has made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. The Company assesses all items classified as unevaluated property on at least an annual basis for possible impairment. The Company assesses properties on a group basis, as a majority of properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization.\nOther Property, Equipment and Land \nOther property, equipment and land is recorded at cost. The Company expenses maintenance and repairs in the period incurred. Upon retirements or disposition of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet with the resulting gains or losses, if any, reflected in operations. Depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets\n, which range from \nthree years\n to \n30\n years.\nEquity Method Investments \nThe Company accounts for its corporate joint ventures and equity investments under the equity method of accounting in accordance with  Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 323 “Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures.” The Company applies the equity method of accounting to investments of less than 50% in an investee over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have control, and investments of greater than 50% in an investee over which the Company does not exercise significant influence or have control. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company’s share of the investee’s earnings or loss is recognized in the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a one or two-month lag for its equity method investments. \nJudgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as, but not limited to, ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions, material intercompany transactions and extent of ownership by an investor in relation to the concentration of other shareholdings. Additionally, an \ninvestment in a limited liability company that maintains a specific ownership account for each investor shall be viewed as similar to an investment in a limited partnership for purposes of determining whether a non-controlling investment shall be accounted for using the equity method or as an investment over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence. \nThe Company reviews its investments to determine if a loss in value which is other than a temporary decline has occurred. If such a loss has occurred, the Company recognizes an impairment provision. There were \nno\n significant impairments of the Company’s equity investments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n See Note 8—\nEquity Method Investments and Related Party Transactions\n for further details.\n77\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company measures the future cost to retire its tangible long-lived assets and recognizes such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a long-lived asset.\nAsset retirement obligations represent the future abandonment costs of tangible assets, namely wells. The fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its then present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount or if there is a change in the estimated liability, the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties. \nThe initial measurement of asset retirement obligations at fair value is calculated using discounted cash flow techniques and based on internal estimates of future retirement costs associated with the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities.\n For additional information regarding the Company’s asset retirement obligations, see Note 7—\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \nOther property and equipment used in operations and midstream assets are reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset.\n The Company had \nno\n significant impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nCapitalized Interest\nThe Company capitalizes interest on expenditures made in connection with exploration and development projects that are not subject to current amortization. Interest is capitalized only for the period that activities are in progress to bring these unevaluated properties to their intended use. Capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense.\n See Note 9—\nDebt\n for further details.\nInventories \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and primarily consist of tubular goods and equipment at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company’s tubular goods and equipment are primarily comprised of oil and natural gas drilling or repair items such as tubing, casing and pumping units.\n \nDebt Issuance Costs\nLong-term debt includes capitalized costs related to the senior notes, net of accumulated amortization. The costs associated with the senior notes are netted against the senior notes balances and are amortized over the term of the senior notes using the effective interest method. See Note 9—\nDebt\n for further details. The costs associated with the Company’s credit facilities are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the term of the facility.\n78\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nOther Accrued Liabilities\nThe Company’s accrued liabilities are financial instruments for which the carrying value approximates fair value. \nOther accrued liabilities consist of the following at December 31, 2024, and 2023:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nDerivative liability payable\n$\n16\n \n$\n13\n \nLease operating expenses payable\n354\n \n160\n \nAd valorem taxes payable\n242\n \n129\n \nAccrued compensation\n79\n \n38\n \nInterest payable\n145\n \n73\n \nMidstream operating expenses payable\n20\n \n8\n \nOther\n164\n \n54\n \nTotal other accrued liabilities\n$\n1,020\n \n$\n475\n \nRevenue and Royalties Payable\nFor certain oil and natural gas properties, where the Company serves as operator, the Company receives production proceeds from the purchaser and further distributes such amounts to other revenue and royalty owners. Production proceeds that the Company has not yet distributed to other revenue and royalty owners are reflected as revenue and royalties payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes revenue for only its net revenue interest in oil and natural gas properties.\n \nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements represent the public’s ownership  interest in Viper as well as Rattler prior to the Rattler Merger, and are presented as a component of equity. When the Company’s relative ownership interests change, adjustments to non-controlling interest and additional paid-in-capital, tax effected, occur. Because these changes in the ownership interests do not result in a change of control, the transactions are accounted for as equity transactions under ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation,” which requires that any differences between the\n \ncarrying value of the Company’s basis in Viper (and Rattler prior to the Rattler Merger) and the fair value of the consideration received are recognized directly in equity and attributed to the controlling interest.\n See Note 10—\nStockholders' Equity and Earnings (Loss) Per Share\n for a discussion of changes in the Company’s\n ownership interest in consolidated subsidiaries\n during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nSales of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are recognized at the point control of the product is transferred to the customer. Virtually all of the pricing provisions in the Company’s contracts are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments to account for various factors depending on the points of sale. As a result, the price of the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids fluctuates to remain competitive with other available oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids supplies.\nOil sales\nThe Company’s oil sales contracts are generally structured where it delivers oil to the purchaser at a contractually agreed-upon delivery point at which the purchaser takes custody, title and risk of loss of the product. The Company recognizes revenue when control transfers to the purchaser at the delivery point based on the price received from the purchaser. Oil revenues are recorded net of any third-party transportation fees and other applicable differentials in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\n79\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nNatural gas and natural gas liquids sales\nUnder the Company’s natural gas processing contracts, it delivers natural gas to a midstream processing entity at the wellhead, battery facilities or the inlet of the midstream processing entity’s system. Generally, the midstream processing entity gathers and processes the natural gas and remits proceeds to the Company for the resulting sales of natural gas liquids and residue gas. In these scenarios, the Company evaluates whether it is the principal or the agent in the transaction. For those contracts where the Company has concluded it is the principal and the ultimate third party is its customer, the Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis, with transportation, gathering, processing, treating and compression fees presented as an expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Under contracts where the Company has concluded that it is the agent, the Company recognizes revenue on a net basis, with transportation, gathering, processing, treating and compression fees as a reduction to revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn certain natural gas processing agreements, the Company may elect to take its residue gas and/or natural gas liquids in-kind at the tailgate of the midstream entity’s processing plant and subsequently market the product. Through the marketing process, the Company delivers product to the ultimate third-party purchaser at a contractually agreed-upon delivery point and receives a specified index price from the purchaser. In this scenario, the Company recognizes revenue when control transfers to the purchaser at the delivery point based on the index price received from the purchaser. The gathering, processing, treating and compression fees attributable to the gas processing contract, as well as any transportation fees incurred to deliver the product to the purchaser, are presented as gathering, processing and transportation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nSales of purchased oil and purchased oil expense\nThe Company enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure available transportation capacity from the Company's areas of production for its commodities. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, the Company has also entered into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to satisfy certain of its unused oil pipeline capacity commitments. Revenues and expenses from these transactions are generally presented on a gross basis in the captions “Sales of purchased oil” and “Purchased oil expense” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as the Company acts as a principal in the transaction by assuming both the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, of the oil volumes purchased and the responsibility to deliver the oil volumes sold. \nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations \nThe Company’s upstream product sales contracts do not originate until production occurs and, therefore, are not considered to exist beyond each days’ production. Therefore, there are \nno\n remaining performance obligations under any of its product sales contracts.\nUnder the Company’s revenue agreements, each delivery generally represents a separate performance obligation; therefore, future volumes delivered are wholly unsatisfied and disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not required. \nContract balances \nUnder the Company’s product sales contracts, it has the right to invoice its customers once the performance obligations have been satisfied, at which point payment is unconditional. Accordingly, the Company’s product sales contracts do not give rise to contract assets or liabilities.\nPrior-period performance obligations\nThe Company records revenue in the month production is delivered to the purchaser. However, purchaser and settlement statements for natural gas and natural gas liquids sales may not be received for \n30\n to \n90\n days after the date production is delivered, and as a result, the Company is required to estimate the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price that will be received for the sale of the product. The Company records the differences between its estimates and the actual amounts received for product sales in the month that payment is received from the purchaser. The Company has existing internal controls for its revenue estimation process and related accruals, and any identified differences between its revenue estimates and actual revenue received historically have not been significant. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 revenue recognized in the reporting period related to performance obligations satisfied in \n80\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nprior reporting periods was not material. The Company believes that the pricing provisions of its oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids contracts are customary in the industry. To the extent actual volumes and prices of oil and natural gas sales are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties, the revenue related to expected sales volumes and prices for those properties are estimated and recorded.\nSee Note 3—\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n for additional discussion of the Company’s revenues.\nAccounting for Equity-Based Compensation\nThe Company has granted various types of stock-based awards including stock options and restricted stock units. Viper and Rattler, prior to the Rattler Merger, have granted various unit-based awards including unit options and phantom units to employees, officers and directors who perform services for the respective entities. These plans and related accounting policies for material awards are defined and described more fully in Note 11—\nEquity-Based Compensation\n. Equity compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed over the required service period. Forfeitures for these awards are recognized as they occur.\nEnvironmental Compliance and Remediation \nEnvironmental compliance and remediation costs, including ongoing maintenance and monitoring, are expensed as incurred. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments and remediation are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (i) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized. \nThe Company records uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process: (i) determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. For additional information regarding income taxes,\n see Note 12—\nIncome Taxes\n.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe following table provides changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related income tax effects related to insignificant pension and postretirement benefit plans the Company acquired from Energen Corporation (“Energen”) and QEP (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of the period\n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n—\n \nNet actuarial gain (loss) on pension and postretirement benefit plans\n2\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n9\n)\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \nBalance at end of the period\n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n(\n7\n)\n81\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nVariable Interest Entity\nViper is a publicly traded corporation formed by the Company in 2014 to provide an attractive return to its stockholders (the largest of which is Diamondback) by focusing on business results, maximizing dividends through organic growth and pursuing accretive growth opportunities through acquisitions of mineral, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits and similar interests from the Company and from third parties. Viper has no employees and the Company provides management, operating and administrative services to Viper under a services and secondment agreement, including the services of the executive officers and other employees.\nIn connection with the reduction of the Company’s ownership percentage in Viper to below \n50\n% in March 2024, the Company re-evaluated whether Viper should continue to be consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. Through December 31, 2024, Viper has continued to meet the definition of a VIE under ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation,” and the Company continued to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE through its ability, via existing contractual agreements, to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of Viper. The Company also has the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could be significant to Viper. As such, the Company will continue to consolidate the activity of Viper.\nViper maintains its own capital structure that is separate from the Company. The Company is not under any obligation to provide additional financial support or investment to Viper. Viper’s assets cannot be used by the Company for general corporate purposes, and the creditors of Viper’s liabilities do not have recourse to the Company’s assets. The assets and liabilities of Viper are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and disclosed parenthetically, if material.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Pronouncements\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, “Leases (Topic 842) – Common Control Arrangements.” This update (i) requires all lessees that are a party to a lease between entities under common control in which there are leasehold improvements to record amortization over the useful life of the leasehold improvements to the common control group, regardless of the lease term, and (ii) requires leasehold improvements to be accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity if, and when, the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset. The Company adopted this update effective January 1, 2024 by electing to apply the guidance in ASU 2023-01 prospectively to all new leasehold improvements recognized on or after January 1, 2024. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance.

The TRP Exchange is expected to expand our operating footprint and enhance our inventory of near-term drilling locations, and was valued at approximately $\n1.4\n billion. The Company funded the cash portion of the exchange with cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. \nThe following table presents the acquisition consideration transferred in the TRP Exchange (in millions):\nConsideration:\nOil and natural gas properties\n$\n989\n \nMidstream assets\n53\n \nSuspense liabilities relieved\n(\n16\n)\nCash consideration\n325\n \nTotal consideration\n$\n1,351\n \nAcquisition Date Fair Value of Consideration Transferred\nThe acquisition date fair value of oil and natural gas properties transferred was determined using an income approach utilizing the discounted cash flow method, which takes into account production forecasts, projected commodity prices and pricing differentials, and estimates of future capital and operating costs which were then discounted utilizing an \n84\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nestimated weighted-average cost of capital for industry market participants.

The oil and natural gas properties transferred did not significantly impact the Company’s capitalized costs or proved reserves as of December 31, 2024.\nThe acquisition date fair value of midstream assets transferred was determined based on the cost approach, which utilized asset listings and cost records with consideration for the age, condition, utilization and economic support of the assets.\nAllocation of Consideration Transferred\nThe TRP Exchange has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations.” The following table represents the allocation of the total consideration transferred in the TRP Exchange to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair values at the acquisition date. Although the allocation of consideration transferred is substantially complete as of the date of this filing, title to properties exchanged remain subject to change as the details of the transaction are finalized subsequent to closing. As such, there may be further adjustments to the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of consideration transferred will be finalized within twelve months of the closing date of the transaction.\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s purchase price allocation (in millions):\nTotal consideration\n$\n1,351\n \nFair value of liabilities assumed:\nSuspense liabilities \n(\n3\n)\nFair value of assets acquired:\nOil and natural gas properties\n1,354\n \nNet assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n$\n1,351\n \nOil and natural gas properties acquired were valued using an income approach utilizing the discounted cash flow method, which takes into account production forecasts, projected commodity prices and pricing differentials, and estimates of future capital and operating costs which were then discounted utilizing an estimated weighted-average cost of capital for industry market participants.

On July 15, 2024, the WTG joint venture sold its subsidiary, WTG Midstream LLC (the “WTG Midstream Transaction”), for which the Company received as its portion of the consideration \n10.1\n million common units issued by Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) and $\n190\n million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The common unit consideration was also subject to preferred distributions to incentive members of the WTG joint venture which reduced the proceeds attributable to the Company. At the closing of the WTG Midstream Transaction, the value attributable to the Company of the \n10.1\n million common units was approximately $\n135\n million, of which approximately $\n81\n million was received by the Company and $\n54\n million remains in an escrow account pursuant to an escrow agreement entered into by the WTG joint venture in connection with the initial transaction. The total value of distributions received by the Company through December 31, 2024 of $\n271\n million (excluding amounts held in escrow) exceeded the carrying value of the Company’s investment balance in the WTG joint venture, resulting in a gain of approximately $\n74\n million, which is included \n85\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nin the caption “Other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nViper Acquisitions \nViper Tumbleweed Acquisitions\nIn September and October of 2024, Viper completed a series of related acquisitions including the Viper TWR Acquisition, the Viper Q Acquisition and the Viper M Acquisition, collectively the (“Viper Tumbleweed Acquisitions”) as defined and discussed below.\nOn October 1, 2024, Viper acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in TWR IV, LLC and TWR IV SellCo, LLC from Tumbleweed Royalty IV, LLC (“TWR IV”) and TWR IV SellCo Parent, LLC (the “Viper TWR Acquisition”), pursuant to a definitive purchase and sale agreement for consideration consisting of approximately (i) $\n464\n million in cash, including transaction costs and certain customary post-closing adjustments, (ii) \n10.09\n million Viper LLC units to TWR IV, (iii) an option for TWR IV to acquire up to \n10.09\n million shares of Viper’s Class B Common Stock (the “TWR Class B Option”), and (iv) contingent cash consideration of up to $\n41\n million, payable in January of 2026, based on the average price of WTI sweet crude oil prompt month futures contracts for the calendar year 2025 (the “WTI 2025 Average”). \nTWR IV can exchange some or all of the Viper LLC units received for an equal number of shares of Viper’s Class A common stock upon expiration of the \nsix month\n lockup period. The mineral and royalty interests acquired in the Viper TWR Acquisition represent approximately \n3,067\n net royalty acres located primarily in the Permian Basin. Viper funded the cash consideration through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under the Viper LLC credit agreement and proceeds from the \nViper 2024 Equity Offering \n(as defined and discussed in Note 10—\nStockholders' Equity and Earnings (Loss) Per Share\n).\nOn September 3, 2024, Viper acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Tumbleweed-Q Royalties, LLC (the “Viper Q Acquisition”), pursuant to a definitive purchase and sale agreement for consideration consisting of (i) approximately $\n114\n million in cash, including transaction costs and certain customary post-closing adjustments, and (ii) contingent cash consideration of up to $\n5\n million, payable in January of 2026, based on the WTI 2025 Average. \nAdditionally, on September 3, 2024, Viper acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in MC TWR Royalties, LP and MC TWR Intermediate, LLC (the “Viper M Acquisition” and together with the Viper Q Acquisition, the “Viper Q & M Acquisitions”), pursuant to a definitive purchase and sale agreement for consideration consisting of (i) approximately $\n76\n million in cash, including transaction costs and certain customary post-closing adjustments, and (ii) contingent cash consideration of up to $\n4\n million, payable in January of 2026, based on the WTI 2025 Average. The mineral and royalty interests acquired in the Viper Q & M Acquisitions,  represent approximately \n406\n and \n267\n net royalty acres located primarily in the Permian Basin, respectively.

The acquisition included approximately \n25,000\n gross (\n16,000\n net) acres in the Midland Basin and certain related oil and gas assets (the “Lario Acquisition”), in exchange for consideration of \n4.33\n million shares of the Company’s common stock and $\n814\n million in cash, including customary post-closing adjustments. Approximately $\n113\n million of the cash consideration was deposited in an indemnity holdback escrow account at closing and was distributed upon satisfactory settlement of any potential title defects on the acquired properties during the first quarter of 2024. The cash consideration for \n86\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nthe Lario Acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand, a portion of the net proceeds from the Company’s offering of \n6.250\n% Senior Notes due 2053 and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. \nThe following table presents the acquisition consideration paid in the Lario Acquisition (in millions, except per share data, shares in thousands):\nConsideration:\nShares of Diamondback common stock issued at closing\n4,330\nClosing price per share of Diamondback common stock on the closing date\n$\n146.12\n \nFair value of Diamondback common stock issued\n$\n633\n \nCash consideration\n814\n \nTotal consideration (including fair value of Diamondback common stock issued)\n$\n1,447\n \nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe Lario Acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method.

The results of operations attributable to the Lario Acquisition since the acquisition date have been included in the consolidated statements of operations and include $\n488\n million of total revenue and $\n200\n million of net income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n87\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nDivestiture of Deep Blue Water Assets and Deep Blue Formation\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company closed on a joint venture agreement with Five Point Energy LLC (“Five Point”) to form Deep Blue Midland Basin LLC (“Deep Blue”). At closing, the Company contributed certain treated water, fresh water and saltwater disposal assets (the “Deep Blue Water Assets”) with a net carrying value of $\n703\n million, including certain post-closing adjustments, and Five Point contributed $\n251\n million in cash to Deep Blue. In exchange for these contributions, Deep Blue issued the Company a one-time cash distribution of approximately $\n516\n million and a \n30\n% equity ownership and voting interest, and issued to Five Point a \n70\n% equity ownership and voting interest. Five Point is not considered a related party of the Company.\nAdditionally, under a separate agreement with Deep Blue, the Company continued to operate the Deep Blue Water Assets on a short-term basis. Five Point agreed to pay the Company approximately $\n47\n million upon the successful transfer of operations to Deep Blue and the Company recorded approximately $\n43\n million as a contingent consideration receivable on the closing date based on the assessed probability of earning the additional consideration. Upon the successful transfer of operations in June 2024, the Company received the full contingent consideration amount of $\n47\n million.\nThe Company recorded its \n30\n% equity interest in Deep Blue at fair value based on the cash consideration and contingent consideration contributed by Five Point to Deep Blue in exchange for its \n70\n% equity ownership. The Company’s equity method investment in Deep Blue had an initial fair value of $\n126\n million. The Company’s proportionate share of the income or loss from Deep Blue is recognized on a \ntwo-month\n lag. The Company has recognized an aggregate $\n13\n million loss on the sale of its Deep Blue Water Assets, of which approximately $\n1\n million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024. The loss on the sale of Deep Blue Water Assets is included in the caption “Other operating expenses” in the consolidated statement of operations. The majority of measurements utilized to determine the fair value amounts reported above relating to this transaction are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and are therefore considered Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company and Five Point currently anticipate collectively contributing $\n500\n million in follow-on capital to fund future growth projects and acquisitions.\nAs part of the transaction, the Company also entered into a \n15-year\n dedication with Deep Blue for its produced water and supply water within a \n12\n-county area of mutual interest in the Midland Basin.

Following the \n90\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nEndeavor Acquisition, the Company believes its inventory has industry-leading depth and quality that will be converted into cash flow with the industry’s lowest cost structure, creating a differentiated value proposition for Diamondback stockholders. \nThe cash consideration for the Endeavor Acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand, the net proceeds from the Company’s April 2024 Notes offering and borrowings under the Tranche A Loans (as defined and discussed in Note 9—\nDebt\n). Immediately following the close of the Endeavor Acquisition, Endeavor equityholders held approximately \n39.8\n% of Diamondback’s common stock. As of December 31, 2024, Endeavor’s equityholders held approximately \n36\n% of the Company’s common stock.\nFollowing the closing of the Endeavor Acquisition, the Company filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement, which became immediately effective upon filing, registering for resale the shares of common stock issued in the Endeavor Acquisition, as required by the terms of the related registration rights agreement.\nThe following table presents the acquisition consideration paid to Endeavor equityholders in the Endeavor Acquisition (in millions, except per share data, shares in thousands):\nConsideration:\nShares of Diamondback common stock issued at closing\n117,267\nClosing price per share of Diamondback common stock on the closing date\n$\n171.49\n \nFair value of Diamondback common stock issued\n$\n20,110\n \nBase cash amount\n$\n8,000\n \nPreliminary closing adjustments\n(\n928\n)\nCash consideration to Endeavor equityholders\n7,072\n \nCash payment of net debt position and make-whole amount\n238\n \nTotal cash consideration\n7,310\n \nTotal consideration (including fair value of Diamondback common stock issued)\n$\n27,420\n \nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe Endeavor Acquisition has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations.” The following table represents the preliminary allocation of the total purchase price for the acquisition of Endeavor to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair values at the acquisition date. Although the purchase price allocation is substantially complete as of the date of this filing, certain data necessary to complete the purchase price allocation is not yet available, including, but not limited to, final tax returns that provide the underlying tax basis of Endeavor’s assets and liabilities. As such, there may be further adjustments to the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including Endeavor’s deferred tax liability, oil and natural gas properties, which include mineral and royalty interests acquired, and other property and equipment. The Company expects to complete the purchase price allocation during the 12-month period following the acquisition date. \n91\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s preliminary purchase price allocation (in millions):\nTotal consideration\n$\n27,420\n \nFair value of liabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable - trade\n$\n18\n \nAccrued capital expenditures\n173\n \nOther accrued liabilities\n613\n \nRevenues and royalties payable\n567\n \nDerivative instruments\n5\n \nIncome taxes payable\n261\n \nOther current liabilities\n21\n \nAsset retirement obligations\n259\n \nDeferred income taxes\n7,211\n \nOther long-term liabilities\n5\n \nAmount attributable to liabilities acquired\n$\n9,133\n \nFair value of assets acquired:\nAccounts receivable - joint interest and other, net\n$\n69\n \nAccounts receivable - oil and natural gas sales, net\n659\n \nInventories\n77\n \nDerivative instruments\n25\n \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n20\n \nOil and natural gas properties\n34,824\n \nOther property, equipment and land\n849\n \nOther assets\n30\n \nAmount attributable to assets acquired\n36,553\n \nNet assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n$\n27,420\n \nThe purchase price allocation above is based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities of Endeavor as of the closing date of the Endeavor Acquisition. The majority of the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was measured based on inputs that are not observable in the market and are therefore considered Level 3 inputs. The fair value of acquired property and equipment is based on the cost approach, which utilized asset listings and cost records with consideration for the reported age, condition, utilization and economic support of the assets. Oil and natural gas properties were valued using an income approach utilizing the discounted cash flow method, which takes into account production and mineral interest forecasts, projected commodity prices and pricing differentials, and estimates of future capital and operating costs which were then discounted utilizing an estimated weighted-average cost of capital for industry market participants. The value of derivative instruments was based on observable inputs including forward commodity-price curves which are considered Level 2 inputs. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences in the tax basis and acquisition-date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values of asset retirement obligations and inventories were calculated in accordance with the Company’s internal policies as described in Note 2—\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n. The fair values of various current assets and liabilities including accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values on the closing date of the Endeavor Acquisition because of the short-term nature of the instruments.\nWith the completion of the Endeavor Acquisition, the Company acquired proved properties of $\n20.6\n billion and unproved properties of $\n14.2\n billion, primarily in the Midland Basin. \nThe results of operations attributable to the Endeavor Acquisition since the acquisition date have been included in the consolidated statements of operations and include $\n1.8\n billion of total revenue and $\n459\n million of net income for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n92\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nPro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited)\nThe following unaudited summary pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 has been prepared to give effect to (i) the Endeavor Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2023, (ii) the TRP Exchange as if it had occurred on January 1, 2023, (iii) the Lario Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2022, and (iv) the FireBird Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of what the combined company’s results of operations would have been if the transaction had occurred on the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of the future financial position or results of operations of the combined company.\nThe below information reflects pro forma adjustments for the issuance of the Company’s common stock as consideration for the Endeavor Acquisition, the Lario Acquisition and the Firebird Acquisition as well as pro forma adjustments based on available information and certain assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, including adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization based on the full cost method of accounting.\nAdditionally, pro forma earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024 include historical acquisition-related costs incurred by Endeavor of $\n415\n million, which consist primarily of incentive compensation, investment banking and legal costs. The Company incurred acquisition related costs of $\n303\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024 which consist primarily of $\n197\n million in severance and accelerated incentive compensation payments to former Endeavor employees, $\n78\n million in investment banking and legal costs incurred upon the closing of the Endeavor Acquisition, $\n14\n million related to regulatory reviews under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other individually insignificant items including SEC filing fees and other professional fees. The pro forma results of operations do not include any cost savings or other synergies that may result from the Endeavor Acquisition or any estimated costs that have been or will be incurred by the Company to integrate the acquired assets. \nThe pro forma financial data does not include the results of operations for any other acquisitions made during the periods presented, as they were primarily acreage acquisitions, and their results were not deemed material.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenues\n$\n15,706\n \n$\n14,618\n \n$\n10,542\n \nIncome (loss) from operations\n$\n6,448\n \n$\n7,787\n \n$\n7,071\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to Diamondback Energy, Inc.\n$\n3,315\n \n$\n5,668\n \n$\n4,834\n \nBasic earnings (loss) per common share\n$\n11.19\n \n$\n18.95\n \n$\n25.74\n \nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share\n$\n11.19\n \n$\n18.95\n \n$\n25.74\n \n93\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n6.    \nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment includes the following:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nOil and natural gas properties:\nSubject to depletion\n$\n59,574\n \n$\n33,771\n \nNot subject to depletion\n22,666\n \n8,659\n \nGross oil and natural gas properties\n82,240\n \n42,430\n \nAccumulated depletion\n(\n11,083\n)\n(\n8,333\n)\nAccumulated impairment\n(\n7,954\n)\n(\n7,954\n)\nOil and natural gas properties, net\n63,203\n \n26,143\n \nOther property, equipment and land\n1,440\n \n673\n \nAccumulated depreciation, amortization, accretion and impairment\n(\n171\n)\n(\n142\n)\nTotal property and equipment, net \n$\n64,472\n \n$\n26,674\n \nBalance of costs not subject to depletion:\nIncurred in 2024\n$\n15,793\n \nIncurred in 2023\n1,205\n \nIncurred in 2022\n660\n \nPrior\n5,008\n \nTotal not subject to depletion\n$\n22,666\n \nCapitalized internal costs were approximately $\n90\n million, $\n66\n million and $\n58\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until the Company has made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. Although the evaluation process has not been completed on our unevaluated properties, the Company currently estimates these costs will be added to the amortization base within \nfifteen years\n.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, the Company is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter which determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of proved oil and natural gas properties. \nNo\n impairment expense was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nIn addition to commodity prices, the Company’s production rates, levels of proved reserves, future development costs, transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine its actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods. If the trailing \n12\n-month commodity prices decline as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters, the Company may have material write downs in subsequent quarters. Given the rate of change impacting the oil and natural gas industry described above, it is possible that circumstances requiring additional impairment testing will occur in future interim periods, which could result in potentially material impairment charges being recorded.\nAt December 31, 2024, there were $\n60\n million in exploration and development costs and $\n473\n million in capitalized interest that are not subject to depletion. At December 31, 2023, there were $\n77\n million in exploration and development costs and $\n337\n million in capitalized interest costs that were not subject to depletion.\n94\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n7.    \nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table describes the changes to the Company’s asset retirement obligations liability for the following periods:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nAsset retirement obligations, beginning of period\n$\n245\n \n$\n347\n \nAdditional liabilities incurred\n8\n \n4\n \nLiabilities acquired\n278\n \n8\n \nLiabilities settled and divested\n(\n37\n)\n(\n88\n)\nAccretion expense\n22\n \n16\n \nRevisions in estimated liabilities\n(1)\n76\n \n(\n42\n)\nAsset retirement obligations, end of period\n592\n \n245\n \nLess: current portion\n(2)\n19\n \n6\n \nAsset retirement obligations - long-term\n$\n573\n \n$\n239\n \n(1)  Revisions in estimated liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 are primarily the result of changes in estimated future plugging and abandonment costs due to increases in current cost estimates and other factors.\n(2) The current portion of the asset retirement obligation is included in the caption “Other accrued liabilities” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company’s asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities. The Company estimates the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells, the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance.\n8.    \nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company considers its equity method investees to be related parties. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had the following significant equity method investments:\nOwnership Interest\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions)\nEPIC Crude Holdings, LP\n(1)\n27.5\n \n%\n$\n204\n \n$\n93\n \nWink to Webster Pipeline LLC\n4\n \n%\n—\n \n92\n \nBANGL LLC\n10\n \n%\n29\n \n29\n \nWTG joint venture\n(2)\n25\n \n%\n—\n \n182\n \nDeep Blue Midland Basin LLC \n30\n \n%\n137\n \n128\n \nOther\nvarious\n5\n \n5\n \nTotal\n$\n375\n \n$\n529\n \n(1)  On July 26, 2024, the Company acquired an additional \n17.5\n% ownership interest in EPIC Crude Holdings, LP (“EPIC”), bringing the Company’s aggregate ownership interest to \n27.5\n%.\n(2)  The WTG joint venture divested its subsidiary during the WTG Midstream Transaction in July 2024 as further discussed in Note 4—\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n.\nIncome (loss) and distributions from the Company’s equity method investees were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. \n95\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe Company reviews its equity method investments to determine if a loss in value which is other than temporary has occurred when events indicate the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable. If such a loss has occurred, the Company recognizes an impairment provision. \nNo\n significant impairments were recorded for the Company’s equity method investments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. If  economic challenges occur in future periods, it could result in circumstances requiring the Company to record potentially material impairment charges on its equity method investments. \nRelated Party Transactions—Deep Blue\nIn addition to the equity method investee activity reported above, the Company had other significant related party transactions with Deep Blue which at December 31, 2024 and 2023, include (i) contingent consideration and other post-close adjustments receivable from Deep Blue, (ii) accrued capital expenditures and other accrued payables related to a commitment to fund certain capital expenditures on projects that were in process at the time of the Deep Blue transaction, and (iii) lease operating expenses and capitalized expenses related to fees paid to Deep Blue under a \n15-year\n dedication for its produced water and supply water within a \n12\n-county area of mutual interest in the Midland Basin. \nThe following table presents the significant related party balances included in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCurrent assets - Accounts receivable\n$\n5\n \n$\n61\n \nCurrent liabilities - Accrued capital expenditures\n$\n(\n31\n)\n$\n(\n21\n)\nCurrent liabilities - Other accrued liabilities\n$\n(\n22\n)\n$\n(\n18\n)\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company also paid Deep Blue approximately $\n135\n million and $\n35\n million, respectively, for water services provided during the completion phase of wells.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had \nno\n outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and $\n2.5\n billion available for future borrowings. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement was \n6.33\n%, \n6.31\n% and \n3.91\n% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company exercised an election to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement by \none year\n to June 2, 2029.\nOutstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a per annum rate elected by Diamondback E&P that is equal to (i) term SOFR plus \n0.10\n% (“Adjusted Term SOFR”) or (ii) an alternate base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the Federal Funds effective rate plus \n0.50\n%, and 1-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus \n1.0\n%), in each case plus the applicable margin. After giving effect to the amendment, (i) the applicable margin ranges from \n0.125\n% to \n1.000\n% per annum in the case of the alternate base rate, and from \n1.125\n% to \n2.000\n% per annum in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case based on the pricing level, and (ii) the commitment fee ranges from \n0.125\n% to \n0.325\n% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the commitments, based on the pricing level. The pricing level depends on the Company’s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings.\nThe credit agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a Total Net Debt to Capitalization Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no more than \n65\n%. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial maintenance covenants under the revolving credit facility, as then in effect.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nIn connection with the Endeavor Acquisition, Diamondback Energy, Inc., as guarantor, entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Diamondback E&P LLC, as borrower, and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Term Loan Agreement”) on February 29, 2024.\nThe Term Loan Agreement provided the Company with the ability to borrow up to $\n1.5\n billion, which was comprised of $\n1.0\n billion of Tranche A Loans (the “Tranche A Loans”) and $\n500\n million of Tranche B Loans on an unsecured basis to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Endeavor Acquisition, repay certain debt of Endeavor or pay fees, costs and expenses related to the acquisition. The undrawn Tranche B Loans were terminated on August 2, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $\n900\n million in outstanding borrowings under the Tranche A Loans. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement was \n6.13\n%.\nThe initial Tranche A Loans were made in a single borrowing on the date of closing of the Endeavor Acquisition (the “Closing Date”) and any remaining outstanding amounts will mature and be payable in full on the first anniversary of the Closing Date.\nOutstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at a per annum rate elected by the Company that is equal to (i) term SOFR plus \n0.10\n% (“Adjusted Term SOFR”) or (ii) an alternate base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus \n0.50\n%, and 1-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus \n1.0\n%), in each case plus the applicable margin. After giving effect to the amendment, (i) the applicable margin ranges from \n0.125\n% to \n1.000\n% per annum in the case of the alternate base rate, and from \n1.125\n% to \n2.000\n% per annum in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case based on the pricing level, and (ii) the commitment fee is equal to \n0.125\n% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of the commitments. The pricing level depends on the Company’s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings.\n98\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nBridge Facility\nOn February 11, 2024, in connection with the Endeavor Acquisition, Diamondback Energy, Inc., as guarantor, obtained commitments of $\n8.0\n billion to a \n364\n-day senior unsecured term loan facility with Diamondback E&P LLC, as borrower, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as administrative agent (the “Bridge Facility”). The Bridge Facility was reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of the Term Loan Agreement to $\n6.5\n billion on February 29, 2024 and was further reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of the April 2024 Notes (as defined below) to $\n1.0\n billion. The undrawn Bridge Facility was terminated on June 4, 2024. The Company recorded additional interest expense of $\n28\n million during the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively, related to the amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs incurred for the Bridge Facility.\n2024 Issuance of Notes\nOn April 18, 2024, Diamondback Energy, Inc., as borrower, and Diamondback E&P LLC, as guarantor, issued an aggregate of $\n5.5\n billion in senior notes, consisting of (i) $\n850\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.200\n% Senior Notes due April 18, 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), (ii) $\n850\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.150\n% Senior Notes due January 30, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), (iii) $\n1.3\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.400\n% Senior Notes due April 18, 2034 (the “2034 Notes”), (iv) $\n1.5\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.750\n% Senior Notes due April 18, 2054 (the “2054 Notes”), and (v) $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.900\n% Senior Notes due April 18, 2064 (the “2064 Notes” and together with the 2027 Notes, the 2030 Notes the 2034 Notes and the 2054 Notes, the “April 2024 Notes”). The April 2024 Notes are included in the Guaranteed Senior Notes for the Company. The Company received net proceeds of $\n5.5\n billion, after underwriters’ discounts and transaction costs. Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semi-annually on January 30 and July 30 of each year, beginning on July 30, 2024. Interest on each other series of notes will be payable semi-annually on April 18 and October 18 of each year. The Company used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Endeavor \n2023 Issuance of Notes\nOn October 19, 2023, Viper completed an offering of $\n400\n million in aggregate principal amount of its \n7.375\n% Senior Notes maturing on November 1, 2031 (the “Viper 2031 Notes”). Viper received net proceeds of approximately $\n394\n million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and transaction costs, from the Viper 2031 Notes. Viper loaned the gross proceeds to Viper LLC, which used the proceeds to partially fund the cash portion of the GRP Acquisition.\nRetirement of Notes\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company opportunistically repurchased principal amounts of $\n22\n million of its \n3.125\n% Senior Notes due 2031 and $\n6\n million of its \n3.500\n% Senior Notes due 2029 for total cash consideration, including accrued interest paid of $\n25\n million. These repurchases resulted in an immaterial gain on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased principal amounts of $\n30\n million of its \n3.250\n% Senior Notes due 2026 and $\n100\n million of its \n3.500\n% Senior Notes due 2029 for total cash consideration, including accrued interest paid, of $\n124\n million. These repurchases resulted in an immaterial loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company redeemed the principal amount of its $\n10\n million \n5.250\n% Senior Notes due 2023 at maturity on May 1, 2023.    \nGuaranteed Senior Notes\nThe Guaranteed Senior Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Diamondback E&P, are senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s future subordinated indebtedness and rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness.\nThe Viper Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Viper, initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Viper LLC, and will pay interest semi-annually.

The weighted average interest rates on borrowings under Viper LLC’s credit agreement were \n7.34\n%, \n7.41\n%, and \n4.22\n% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Viper LLC’s  credit agreement will mature on September 22, 2028.\nThe outstanding borrowings under Viper LLC’s credit agreement bear interest at a rate elected by Viper LLC that is equal to (i) term SOFR plus \n0.10\n% (“Adjusted Term SOFR”), or (ii) an alternate base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the Federal Funds effective rate plus \n0.50\n% and 1-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus \n1.0\n%), in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from \n1.00\n% to \n2.00\n% per annum in the case of the alternative base rate and from \n2.00\n% to \n3.00\n% per annum in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case depending on the amount of the loans outstanding in relation to the commitment, which is calculated using the least of the maximum credit amount, the aggregate elected commitment amount and the borrowing base. Viper LLC is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from \n0.375\n% to \n0.500\n% per year on the unused portion of the commitment. The credit agreement is secured by substantially all the assets of Viper and Viper LLC. \nThe Viper LLC credit agreement contains various affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants. These covenants, among other things, limit additional indebtedness, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates, excess cash and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below.\nFinancial Covenant\nRequired Ratio\nRatio of total net debt to EBITDAX, as defined in the Viper LLC credit agreement\nNot greater than \n4.0\n  to 1.0\nRatio of current assets to liabilities, as defined in the Viper LLC credit agreement\nNot less than \n1.0\n to 1.0\nRatio of secured debt to EBITDAX, as defined in the Viper LLC credit agreement\nNot greater than \n2.5\n to 1.0\nAs of December 31, 2024, Viper LLC was in compliance with all financial maintenance covenants under the Viper LLC credit agreement.\nInterest Expense\nThe following amounts have been incurred and charged to interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nInterest expense\n$\n624\n \n$\n346\n \n$\n272\n \nOther fees and expenses\n3\n \n2\n \n12\n \nLess: interest income\n156\n \n18\n \n6\n \nLess: capitalized interest\n336\n \n171\n \n124\n \nInterest expense, net\n$\n135\n \n$\n159\n \n$\n154\n \n100\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n10.    \nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nThe Company’s board of directors has approved a common stock repurchase program to acquire up to $\n6.0\n billion of the Company’s outstanding common stock, excluding excise tax. Purchases under the repurchase program may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, and are subject to market conditions, applicable regulatory and legal requirements, contractual obligations and other factors. The repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. This repurchase program may be suspended from time to time, modified, extended or discontinued by the board of directors at any time. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased approximately $\n959\n million, $\n838\n million and $\n1.1\n billion of common stock under the respective repurchase programs, respectively, in each case excluding excise tax. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $\n2.7\n billion remained available for future repurchases under the Company’s common stock repurchase program, excluding excise tax.\nViper 2024 Equity Offering\nOn September 13, 2024, Viper completed an underwritten public offering of approximately \n11.5\n million\n shares of its Class A common stock, which included \n1.5\n million\n shares issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock granted to the under\nwriters, at a price to the public of $\n42.50\n per share fo\nr total net proceeds to Viper of approximately \n$\n476\n million\n, \nafter underwriters’ discounts and \ntransaction costs (the “Viper 2024 Equity Offering”).

During the year ended December 31, 2024 Viper had \nno\n repurchases under its repurchase program. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Viper repurchased approximately $\n95\n million, and $\n151\n million under its repurchase program.

Prior to the Rattler Merger, Rattler made $\n35\n million of distributions to its common unitholders during the year ended December 31, 2022 in accordance with the distribution policy approved by its board of directors. These dividends are reflected under the caption “Dividends/distributions to non-controlling interest” on the Company’s consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and consolidated statements of cash flows.\n102\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe Company’s basic earnings (loss) per share amounts have been computed using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation proportional to the respective ownership among holders of common stock and participating securities. Basic earnings (loss) per share amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share include the effect of potentially dilutive shares outstanding for the period. Additionally, the per share earnings of Viper and Rattler prior to the Effective Date of the Rattler Merger are included in the consolidated earnings per share computation based on the consolidated group’s holdings of  the subsidiaries. \nA reconciliation of the components of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share is presented below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shares\n$\n3,338\n \n$\n3,143\n \n$\n4,386\n \nLess: distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities\n(1)\n21\n \n22\n \n42\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\n$\n3,317\n \n$\n3,121\n \n$\n4,344\n \nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding\n213,545\n \n179,999\n \n176,539\n \nEffect of dilutive securities:\nWeighted-average potential common shares issuable\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n213,545\n \n179,999\n \n176,539\n \nBasic net income (loss) attributable to common shares\n$\n15.53\n \n$\n17.34\n \n$\n24.61\n \nDiluted net income (loss) attributable to common shares\n$\n15.53\n \n$\n17.34\n \n$\n24.61\n \n(1)    Unvested restricted stock awards and performance stock awards that contain nonforfeitable distribution equivalent rights are considered participating securities and therefore are included in the earnings per share calculation pursuant to the two-class method.\n11.    \nEQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION\nUnder the equity incentive plan (the “Equity Plan”), approved by the board of directors, the Company is authorized to issue up to \n11.80\n million shares of incentive and non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, performance awards and stock appreciation rights to eligible employees. The Company currently has outstanding restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units under the Equity Plan. At December 31, 2024, approximately \n4.65\n million shares of common stock remain available for future grants under the Equity Plan. The Company classifies its restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units as equity-based awards and estimates the fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date of the award, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period.\nIn addition to the Equity Plan, Viper maintains its own long-term incentive plan, which is not significant to the Company.\nThe following table presents the financial statement impacts of equity compensation plans and related costs on the Company’s financial statements:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$\n65\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n55\n \nEquity-based compensation capitalized pursuant to full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties\n$\n30\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n21\n \n103\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following table presents the Company’s restricted stock unit activity during the year ended December 31, 2024 under the Equity Plan:\nRestricted Stock\n Units\nWeighted Average Grant-Date\nFair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2023\n751,196\n \n$\n132.29\n \nGranted\n368,390\n \n$\n179.64\n \nVested\n(\n436,343\n)\n$\n129.85\n \nForfeited\n(\n37,835\n)\n$\n151.39\n \nUnvested at December 31, 2024\n645,408\n \n$\n159.84\n \nThe aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n57\n million, $\n48\n million and $\n41\n million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units was $\n78\n million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n2.0\n years. \nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nTo provide long-term incentives for executive officers to deliver competitive returns to the Company’s stockholders, the Company has granted performance-based restricted stock units to eligible employees. The ultimate number of shares awarded from these conditional restricted stock units is based upon measurement of total stockholder return of the Company’s common stock (“TSR”) as compared to a designated peer group during a \nthree-year\n performance period. \nIn March 2024, eligible employees received performance restricted stock unit awards totaling \n110,989\n units from which a minimum of \n0\n% and a maximum of \n200\n% of the units could be awarded based upon the measurement of total stockholder return of the Company’s common stock as compared to a designated peer group during the \nthree-year\n performance period of January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026 and cliff vest at December 31, 2026 subject to continued employment. The initial payout of the March 2024 awards will be further adjusted by a TSR modifier that may reduce the payout or increase the payout up to a maximum of \n250\n%.

The initial payout of the March 2023 awards will be further adjusted by a TSR modifier that may reduce the payout or increase the payout up to a maximum of \n250\n%. Additionally, in July 2023 the Company granted \n1,858\n units under substantially the same terms as the March 2023 performance restricted stock unit awards.\nIn March 2022, eligible employees received performance restricted stock unit awards totaling \n126,905\n units from which a minimum of \n0\n% and a maximum of \n200\n% units could be awarded based upon the TSR during the \nthree-year\n performance period of January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. These awards cliff vested at \n250\n% on December 31, 2024 based upon the results of the TSR during the performance period, which was further adjusted by a TSR modifier.\nThe fair value of each performance restricted stock unit issuance is estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, which results in an expected percentage of units to be earned during the performance period. \n104\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe following table presents a summary of the grant-date fair values of performance restricted stock units granted and the related assumptions for the awards granted during the periods presented:\nMarch 2024\nSeptember 2024\nMarch 2023\nJuly 2023\n2022\nGrant-date fair value\n$\n341.38\n \n$\n337.23\n \n$\n259.52\n \n$\n222.09\n \n$\n237.13\n \nRisk-free rate\n4.38\n \n%\n3.54\n \n%\n4.64\n \n%\n4.70\n \n%\n1.44\n \n%\nCompany volatility\n41.40\n \n%\n34.40\n \n%\n46.90\n \n%\n47.20\n \n%\n72.10\n \n%\nThe following table presents the Company’s performance restricted stock unit activity under the Equity Plan for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nPerformance Restricted Stock Units\nWeighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2023\n278,056\n \n$\n234.80\n \nGranted\n293,081\n \n$\n341.14\n \nVested\n(\n292,235\n)\n$\n114.12\n \nUnvested at December 31, 2024\n(1)\n278,902\n \n$\n278.72\n \n(1)\nA maximum of \n647,818\n units could be awarded based upon the Company’s final TSR ranking.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company’s unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance based restricted stock awards and units was $\n41\n million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n1.8\n years.\n12.    \nINCOME TAXES\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company is subject to corporate income taxes and the Texas margin tax. The Company and its subsidiaries, other than Viper, Viper LLC and other certain subsidiaries classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, file a U.S. federal corporate income tax return on a consolidated basis. Viper’s provision for income taxes is included in the Company’s consolidated income tax provision and, to the extent applicable, in net income attributable to the non-controlling interest.\nSubsequent to the Effective Date of the Rattler Merger, Rattler is a member of the group filing consolidated income tax returns with Diamondback Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries. As such, Rattler’s current and deferred income taxes continue to be included in the Company’s consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations. \nThe Company’s effective income tax rates were \n17.8\n%, \n21.5\n% and \n20.5\n% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 differed from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to pre-tax income primarily due to (i) the impact of removing the valuation allowance against Viper, (ii) state income taxes, net of federal benefit, and (iii) other permanent differences between book and taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2024. Total income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 differed from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to pre-tax income for the period primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit, partially offset by the impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income and tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the valuation allowance on Viper’s deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 2023. Total income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 differed from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to pre-tax income for the period primarily due to (i) state income taxes, net of federal benefit, partially offset by (ii) the impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income and (iii) tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the valuation allowance on Viper’s and QEP’s deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn connection with the closing of the Endeavor Acquisition, the Company assumed approximately $\n261\n million of taxes payable and recognized a $\n7.2\n billion deferred tax liability. \n105\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nIn connection with the Company’s public offering of Viper’s Class A common stock and resulting decrease in its ownership of Viper in March 2024, the Company recorded a $\n36\n million increase in tax payable and a $\n3\n million increase in deferred tax liability through paid in capital and an $\n18\n million increase in the deferred tax asset, net of valuation allowance, through non-controlling interest on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nThe components of the Company’s consolidated provision for income taxes from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nCurrent income tax provision (benefit):\nFederal\n$\n752\n \n$\n505\n \n$\n421\n \nState\n33\n \n29\n \n33\n \nTotal current income tax provision (benefit)\n785\n \n534\n \n454\n \nDeferred income tax provision (benefit):\nFederal\n10\n \n370\n \n706\n \nState\n5\n \n8\n \n14\n \nTotal deferred income tax provision (benefit)\n15\n \n378\n \n720\n \nTotal provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n$\n800\n \n$\n912\n \n$\n1,174\n \nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax amount from continuing operations to the recorded expense is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) at the federal statutory rate (21%)\n$\n945\n \n$\n892\n \n$\n1,205\n \nState income tax expense, net of federal tax effect\n30\n \n31\n \n42\n \nNon-deductible compensation\n9\n \n8\n \n10\n \nChange in valuation allowance\n(\n156\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n71\n)\nOther, net\n(\n28\n)\n(\n12\n)\n(\n12\n)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n$\n800\n \n$\n912\n \n$\n1,174\n \n106\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss and other carryforwards\n$\n225\n \n$\n236\n \nDerivative instruments\n—\n \n22\n \nViper's investment in Viper LLC\n185\n \n170\n \nOther\n75\n \n28\n \nDeferred tax assets\n485\n \n456\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n119\n)\n(\n233\n)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n366\n \n223\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nOil and natural gas properties and equipment\n9,850\n \n2,463\n \nMidstream investments\n140\n \n162\n \nOther\n29\n \n2\n \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n10,019\n \n2,627\n \nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$\n9,653\n \n$\n2,404\n \nThe Company had net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $\n9.7\n billion and $\n2.4\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $\n332\n million of federal NOLs and $\n4\n million of federal tax credits expiring in 2037 and $\n206\n million of federal NOLs with an indefinite carryforward life, including NOLs acquired from QEP.

The Company’s federal tax attributes, including those acquired from QEP and Rattler, are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which relates to tax attribute limitations upon the 50% or greater change of ownership of an entity during any three-year look back period. Other than as described below regarding realization of tax attributes acquired from QEP, the Company believes that the application of Section 382 of the Code will not have an adverse effect on future usage of the Company’s NOLs and credits.\nOn August 24, 2022, the Company completed the Rattler Merger. Management assessed the likelihood that the federal net operating losses and other tax attributes acquired from Rattler will be utilized, taking into consideration Rattler’s inclusion in consolidated income tax returns with Diamondback, and the annual limitation on utilization of tax attributes following Rattler’s ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the Code. As a result of the assessment, including consideration of all available positive and negative evidence, management determined that it continues to be more likely than not that Rattler will realize its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a valuation allowance of $\n11\n million related to federal NOL and credit carryforwards acquired from QEP which are estimated not more likely than not to be realized prior to expiration.\n \nIn addition, the Company had a valuation allowance of $\n108\n million primarily related to certain state NOL carryforwards which the Company does not believe are realizable as it does not anticipate significant future operations in those states and fully released Viper’s remaining valuation allowance, as discussed further below. Management’s assessment at each balance sheet date included consideration of all available positive and negative evidence including the anticipated timing of reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the limitations imposed by Section 382 of the Code on certain of the Company’s NOLs and other carryforwards. Management believes that the balance of the Company’s NOLs is realizable to the extent of future taxable income primarily related to the excess of book carrying value of properties over their respective tax bases. As of December 31, 2024, management determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its remaining deferred tax assets. \n107\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities include deferred tax assets of approximately $\n185\n million related to Viper’s investment in Viper LLC. Deferred taxes are provided on the difference between Viper’s basis for financial accounting purposes and basis for federal income tax purposes in its investment in Viper LLC. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Viper released its remaining valuation allowance of approximately $\n156\n million as a result of management’s assessment of the realizability of future taxable income. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Viper recognized deferred income tax benefits of $\n7\n million and $\n50\n million, respectively, related to a partial release in its beginning-of-the year valuation allowance, based on a change in judgment about the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Management’s assessment of all available evidence, both positive and negative, supporting realizability of Viper’s deferred tax assets as required by applicable accounting standards, resulted in recognition of tax benefit for the portion of Viper’s deferred tax assets considered more likely than not to be realized. The positive evidence assessed included recent cumulative income due in part to higher commodity prices remaining consistently high, acquisitions of additional oil and natural gas properties and an expectation of future taxable income based upon recent actual and forecasted production volumes and prices. \nThe following table sets forth changes in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n7\n \nDecrease resulting from expiration of statute\n—\n \n(\n7\n)\n—\n \nBalance at end of year\n—\n \n—\n \n7\n \nLess: Effects of temporary items\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n4\n)\nTotal that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate as of the end of the year\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3\n \nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The Company’s federal and state income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2021 through December 31, 2023 remain open for all purposes of examination by the IRS and major state taxing jurisdictions. However, certain earlier tax years remain open for adjustment to the extent of their NOL carryforwards available for future utilization. It is reasonably possible that significant changes to the reserve for uncertain tax positions may occur as a result of various audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations. Although the timing and outcome of tax examinations is highly uncertain, the Company does not expect the change in unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months would have a material impact to the financial statements.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as interest expense and general and administrative expenses, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, there was no interest associated with uncertain tax positions recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was an insignificant amount of interest associated with uncertain tax positions recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were \nno\n penalties related to each period associated with uncertain tax positions recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n \n13.    \nDERIVATIVES\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company has commodity derivative contracts and interest rate swaps outstanding. All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value.\nCommodity Contracts\nThe Company has entered into multiple crude oil and natural gas derivatives, indexed to the respective indices as noted in the table below, to reduce price volatility associated with certain of its oil and natural gas sales. As part of the Endeavor Acquisition, the Company acquired a number of derivative financial instruments that were added to its hedging program during the third quarter of 2024. The Company has not designated its commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, marks its commodity derivative instruments to fair value and recognizes the cash and \n108\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nnon-cash changes in fair value in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption “Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net.”\nBy using derivative instruments to economically hedge exposure to changes in commodity prices, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, which creates credit risk. The Company has entered into commodity derivative instruments only with counterparties that are also lenders under its credit facility and have been deemed an acceptable credit risk. As such, collateral is not required from either the counterparties or the Company on its outstanding commodity derivative contracts.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had the following outstanding commodity derivative contracts.

During the third quarter of 2024, the Company terminated and settled $\n300\n million of the notional amount of \none\n interest rate swap for a loss of $\n37\n million recognized in the caption “Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net” on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. As a result of the partial termination, the Company has remaining interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $\n900\n million at December 31, 2024. The Company receives a fixed \n3.50\n% rate of interest on these swaps. Effective on May 28, 2023, the variable rate of interest the Company pays on these swaps was reset from three month LIBOR to three month SOFR plus \n2.1865\n%.\nThe interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges at inception. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company elected to fully dedesignate these interest rate swaps and hedge accounting was discontinued. The cumulative fair value basis adjustment recorded on the 2029 Notes at the time of dedesignation totaled $\n135\n million. This basis adjustment is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the 2029 Notes utilizing the effective interest method. See Note 9—\nDebt\n for further details. The dedesignated interest rate swaps are considered economic hedges of the Company’s fixed-rate debt. As such, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps after the date of dedesignation have been recorded in earnings under the caption “Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net” in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTreasury Locks\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into certain treasury lock contracts to reduce the forecasted interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the April 2024 Notes. The treasury locks were terminated and settled upon issuance of the April 2024 Notes with a loss of $\n25\n million recognized in the caption “Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net” on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nBalance Sheet Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nThe fair value of derivative instruments is generally determined using established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other things, futures prices and time to maturity. These fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions, including any deferred premiums, that are with the same counterparty and are subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement. See Note 14—\nFair Value Measurements\n for further details.\nGains and Losses on Derivative Instruments\nThe following table summarizes the gains and losses on derivative instruments included in the consolidated statements of operations: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments, net:\nCommodity contracts\n$\n210\n \n$\n(\n239\n)\n$\n(\n528\n)\nInterest rate swaps\n(\n45\n)\n(\n20\n)\n(\n58\n)\n2026 WTI Contingent Liability\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nTreasury locks\n(\n25\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n137\n \n$\n(\n259\n)\n$\n(\n586\n)\nNet cash received (paid) on settlements:\nCommodity contracts\n(2)\n$\n57\n \n$\n(\n61\n)\n$\n(\n849\n)\nInterest rate swaps\n(1)\n(\n83\n)\n(\n49\n)\n(\n1\n)\nTreasury locks\n(\n25\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n(\n51\n)\n$\n(\n110\n)\n$\n(\n850\n)\n110\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n(1)\nThe year ended December 31, 2024 includes cash paid on interest rate swaps terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $\n37\n million.\n(2)\nThe year ended December 31, 2022 includes cash paid on commodity contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $\n138\n million.\n14.    \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. \nThe fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses appropriate valuation techniques based on available inputs to measure the fair values of its assets and liabilities. \nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date. \nLevel 2 - Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value. \nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nSee Note 4—\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n and Note 5—\nEndeavor Energy Resources, LP Acquisition\n for discussion of the fair values of proved oil and natural gas properties assumed in business combinations.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nCertain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis, including the Company’s commodity derivative instruments, interest rate swaps, and investments in the common stock of other entities. The fair values of the Company’s commodity derivative contracts are measured internally using established commodity futures price strips for the underlying commodity provided by a reputable third party, the contracted notional volumes, and time to maturity. The fair values of the Company’s interest rate swaps are determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets, are determined based on inputs readily available in public markets, can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets, or are provided by financial institutions that trade these contracts. These valuations are Level 2 inputs. The fair value of interest rate swaps is recorded as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The net amounts of derivative instruments are classified as current or noncurrent based on their anticipated settlement dates. The Company has an immaterial investment in the Class A common stock of Verde Clean Fuels, Inc. The Company elected the fair value option for measuring the fair value of this equity investment. The investment is reported at fair value using observable, quoted stock prices and is included in “Other assets” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024. \nViper LLC has an immaterial contingent liability that is reported at fair value using observable market data inputs and a Monte Carlo pricing model, which are considered Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. The 2026 WTI Contingent Liability is recorded in “Other long-term liabilities” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024, with the change in fair value being recognized in “Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net” on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. \n111\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe following table provides \n(i) fair value measurement information for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, (ii) \nthe gross amounts of recognized derivative assets and liabilities, (iii) the amounts offset under master netting arrangements with counterparties, and (iv) the resulting net amounts presented under the captions “Derivative instruments” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets \nas of \nDecember 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nAs of December 31, 2024\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal Gross Fair Value\nGross Amounts Offset in Balance Sheet\nNet Fair Value Presented in Balance Sheet\n(In millions)\nAssets:\nCurrent assets- Derivative instruments:\nCommodity derivative instruments\n$\n—\n \n$\n274\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n274\n \n$\n(\n106\n)\n$\n168\n \nNon-current assets- Derivative instruments:\nCommodity derivative instruments\n$\n—\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n2\n \nNon-current assets- Other assets:\nInvestment\n$\n8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n8\n \nLiabilities:\nCurrent liabilities- Derivative instruments:\nCommodity derivative instruments\n$\n—\n \n$\n121\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n121\n \n$\n(\n106\n)\n$\n15\n \nInterest rate swaps\n$\n—\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n28\n \nNon-current liabilities- Derivative instruments:\nCommodity derivative instruments\n$\n—\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n10\n \nInterest rate swaps\n$\n—\n \n$\n96\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n96\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n96\n \nNon-current liabilities- Other long-term liabilities:\n2026 WTI Contingent Liability\n$\n—\n \n$\n30\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n30\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n30\n \n112\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal Gross Fair Value\nGross Amounts Offset in Balance Sheet\nNet Fair Value Presented in Balance Sheet\n(In millions)\nAssets:\nCurrent assets- Derivative instruments:\nCommodity derivative instruments\n$\n—\n \n$\n88\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n88\n \n$\n(\n71\n)\n$\n17\n \nNon-current assets- Derivative instruments:\nCommodity derivative instruments\n$\n—\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n1\n \nNon-current assets- Other assets:\nInvestment\n$\n5\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \nLiabilities:\nCurrent liabilities- Derivative instruments:\nCommodity derivative instruments\n$\n—\n \n$\n111\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n111\n \n$\n(\n71\n)\n$\n40\n \nInterest rate swaps\n$\n—\n \n$\n46\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n46\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n46\n \nNon-current liabilities- Derivative instruments:\nCommodity derivative instruments\n$\n—\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n5\n \nInterest rate swaps\n$\n—\n \n$\n117\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n117\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n117\n \nAssets and Liabilities Not Recorded at Fair Value\nThe following table provides the fair value of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCarrying\nCarrying\nValue\nFair Value\nValue\nFair Value\n(In millions)\nDebt\n$\n12,975\n \n$\n12,564\n \n$\n6,641\n \n$\n6,507\n \nThe fair values of the Company’s credit agreement and Viper LLC’s credit agreement approximate their carrying values based on borrowing rates available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

While the ultimate outcome of the pending proceedings, disputes or claims and any resulting impact on the Company, cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company’s management believes that none of these matters, if ultimately decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company’s assessment is based on information known about the pending matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Actual outcomes could differ materially from the Company’s assessment. The Company records accrued liabilities for contingencies related to outstanding legal proceedings, disputes or claims when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nCommitments\nThe following is a schedule of minimum future payments with commitments that have initial or remaining noncancellable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2024:\nYear Ending December 31,\nTransportation Commitments\n(1)(2)\nElectrical Fracturing  Fleet\n(3)\nSand Supply Agreement\n(4)\nProduced Water Disposal Commitments\n(5)\nElectrical Power Agreements\n(6)\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n209\n \n$\n74\n \n$\n41\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n99\n \n2026\n232\n \n50\n \n23\n \n4\n \n77\n \n2027\n278\n \n50\n \n2\n \n3\n \n67\n \n2028\n268\n \n25\n \n—\n \n4\n \n37\n \n2029\n267\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n35\n \nThereafter\n1,585\n \n—\n \n—\n \n18\n \n50\n \nTotal\n$\n2,839\n \n$\n199\n \n$\n66\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n365\n \n114\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n(1)\nTotal costs incurred under take-or-pay and throughput obligations were approximately $\n337\n million, $\n266\n million and $\n249\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(2)\nThe Company has committed to transport gross quantities of crude oil and natural gas on various pipelines under a variety of contracts including throughput and take-or-pay agreements. The Company’s failure to purchase the minimum level of quantities would require it to pay shortfall fees up to the amount of the original monthly commitment amounts included in the table above. \n(3)\nIn 2022, the Company entered into commitments for \nthree years\n for the Company’s electric fracturing fleet and related power generating services. Subsequently, certain commitments have been extended.\n(4)\nThe Company has committed to purchase minimum quantities of sand for use in its drilling operations.

In response to the insolvency of the operator of record, the government ordered the former operators and/or alleged former lease record title owners to decommission the platform and related facilities. The Company has agreed to an arrangement with other operators to contribute to a trust to fund the decommissioning costs, however, the Company’s portion of such costs are not expected to be material.\nSeveral coastal Louisiana parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed numerous lawsuits under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (“SLCRMA”) against numerous oil and gas producers seeking damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within Louisiana’s coastal zone. The Company is a defendant in \nfive\n of these cases. The Company has exercised contractual indemnification rights where applicable. Plaintiffs’ SLCRMA theories are unprecedented, and there remains significant uncertainty about the claims (both as to scope and damages). Although the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company believes the claims lack merit and intends to continue vigorously defending these lawsuits.\n115\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n17.    \nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nFourth Quarter 2024 Dividend Declaration\nOn February 21, 2025, the board of directors of the Company approved an increase in the Company’s annual base dividend to $\n4.00\n per share of common stock and declared a cash base dividend for the fourth quarter of 2024 of $\n1.00\n per share of common stock, payable on March 13, 2025 to its stockholders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2025. Future base and variable dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors of the Company.\nPending Double Eagle Acquisition\nOn February 14, 2025, the Company entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with Double Eagle IV Midco, LCC (“Double Eagle”), to acquire all of the issued and outstanding interests of DE Permian, LLC, DE IV Combo, LLC, and DE IV Operating, LLC, each of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Double Eagle (the “Double Eagle Acquisition”) for consideration of $\n3.0\n billion in cash and approximately \n6.9\n million shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to customary adjustments. The pending Double Eagle Acquisition consists of approximately \n67,700\n gross (\n40,000\n net) acres, which are primarily located in the Midland Basin, and approximately \n407\n gross (\n342\n net) horizontal locations in primary development targets. The Company intends to fund the cash portion of the pending Double Eagle Acquisition through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under the Company’s credit facility or proceeds from term loans and senior notes offerings. The pending Double Eagle Acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approval.\nViper 2025 Equity Offering\nOn February 3, 2025, Viper completed an underwritten public offering of approximately \n28.34\n million shares of Viper’s Class A common stock, which included \n3.70\n million shares issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares of Viper’s Class A common stock granted to the underwriters, at a price to the public of $\n44.50\n per share for total net proceeds of approximately $\n1.2\n billion, after the underwriters’ discount and transaction costs (the “Viper 2025 Equity Offering”). \nThe net proceeds will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the \npending 2025 Drop Down\n (defined below), if it closes\n.\nPending 2025 Drop Down Transaction\nOn January 30, 2025, Endeavor Energy Resources, LP (“EER LP”) and 1979 Royalties, LP and 1979 Royalties GP, LLC (collectively, the “Endeavor Subsidiaries”), each of which is a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a definitive equity purchase agreement with Viper and Viper LLC to divest the Endeavor Subsidiaries from EER LP to Viper in exchange for consideration consisting of (i) $\n1.0\n billion in cash and (ii) the issuance of \n69.63\n million Viper LLC units and an equivalent number of shares of Viper’s Class B common stock (collectively, the “Equity Issuance”), in each case subject to customary closing adjustments, including, among other things, for net title benefits (such transaction, the “2025 Drop Down”). The pending 2025 Drop Down is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to (i) the approval of the pending 2025 Drop Down by Viper’s stockholders at the special meeting of Viper’s stockholders during the second quarter of 2025, excluding the shares beneficially owned by the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) regulatory clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and (iii) the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions. Additionally, the Equity Issuance is subject to the approval by a majority of the total votes cast at the special meeting on such proposal, as required by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Viper expects to fund the cash consideration for the pending 2025 Drop Down with the net proceeds from the Viper 2025 Equity Offering. The pending 2025 Drop Down will be accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control.\nEER LP can exchange some or all of the Viper LLC units received together with \none\n share of Viper’s Class B common stock for an equal number of shares of Viper’s Class A common stock. The mineral and royalty interests owned by Endeavor Subsidiaries being divested in the pending 2025 Drop Down represent approximately \n22,847\n net royalty acres in the Permian Basin, \n69\n% of which are operated by the Company, and have an average net royalty interest of approximately \n2.8\n% and current oil production of approximately \n17,097\n BO/d (the “Endeavor Mineral and Royalty Interests”). The Endeavor Mineral and Royalty Interests include interests in horizontal wells comprised of \n6,055\n gross proved developed production wells (of which approximately \n29\n% are operated by the Company), \n116\n gross completed wells and \n394\n gross drilled but uncompleted wells, all of which are principally concentrated in the Midland Basin, with the balance located primarily in the Delaware and Williston Basins.\n116\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n18.    \nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company is managed on a consolidated basis as \none\n operating segment and \none\n reportable segment: the upstream segment, which is engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas. This singular operating and reportable segment is comprised of (i) the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and (ii) Viper and its consolidated subsidiaries, which have been aggregated due to the similarity in their economic characteristics, products and services, processes, type of customers, method of distribution for their products and the regulatory environment in which they operate. The upstream segment derives its revenue from customers through the sale of oil and natural gas products as well as other immaterial service contracts. See Note 3—\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n for further discussion of the Company’s sources of revenue.\nThe Company’s CODM is a senior executive committee that is comprised of the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses the Company’s consolidated financial results to make key operating decisions, assess performance and to allocate resources. The measures of segment profit or loss and total assets utilized by the CODM are net income and total assets as reported on the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. The significant expense categories, their amounts and other segment items that are regularly provided to the CODM are those that are reported in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations as well as interest income and interest expense in Note 9—\nDebt\n.\nThe CODM uses consolidated net income as a measure of profitability to evaluate segment performance and to make capital allocation decisions such as reinvestment in the business or return of capital through the payment of base and variable dividends or repurchases under the share repurchase program.\n19.    \nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)\nThe Company’s oil and natural gas reserves are attributable solely to properties within the United States.\nCapitalized oil and natural gas costs\nAggregate capitalized costs related to oil and natural gas production activities with applicable accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nOil and natural gas properties:\nProved properties\n$\n59,574\n \n$\n33,771\n \nUnproved properties\n22,666\n \n8,659\n \nTotal oil and natural gas properties\n82,240\n \n42,430\n \nAccumulated depletion\n(\n11,083\n)\n(\n8,333\n)\nAccumulated impairment\n(\n7,954\n)\n(\n7,954\n)\nNet oil and natural gas properties capitalized\n$\n63,203\n \n$\n26,143\n \n117\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nCosts incurred in oil and natural gas activities\nCosts incurred in oil and natural gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nAcquisition costs:\nProved properties\n$\n21,275\n \n$\n1,314\n \n$\n778\n \nUnproved properties\n15,568\n \n1,701\n \n1,536\n \nDevelopment costs\n2,992\n \n1,962\n \n566\n \nExploration costs\n194\n \n768\n \n1,698\n \nTotal\n$\n40,029\n \n$\n5,745\n \n$\n4,578\n \nResults of Operations from Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities\nThe following schedule sets forth the revenues and expenses related to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It does not include any interest costs or general and administrative costs. Income tax expense has been calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to oil, gas and natural gas liquids sales after deducting production costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization and accretion and impairment. Therefore, the following schedule is not necessarily indicative of the contribution to the net operating results of the Company’s oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids operations.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquid sales\n$\n10,100\n \n$\n8,228\n \n$\n9,566\n \nProduction costs\n(\n2,280\n)\n(\n1,684\n)\n(\n1,521\n)\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion\n(\n2,781\n)\n(\n1,684\n)\n(\n1,264\n)\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\n(\n1,025\n)\n(\n1,000\n)\n(\n1,437\n)\nResults of operations\n$\n4,014\n \n$\n3,860\n \n$\n5,344\n \nOil and Natural Gas Reserves\nProved oil and natural gas reserve estimates and their associated future net cash flows were prepared by the Company’s internal reservoir engineers and audited by Ryder Scott, independent petroleum engineers, as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Proved reserves were estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions based upon SEC Prices for the periods ending December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent the net revenue interest in the Company’s properties, all of which are located within the continental United States. Although the Company believes these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.\n118\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe following table presents changes in the Company’s estimated proved reserves (including those attributable to Viper).

Divestitures of \n10,882\n MBOE related primarily to non-core Delaware Basin assets and the Eagle Ford Basin Divestiture.\nProved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs) \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company’s estimated PUD reserves were approximately \n1,172,618\n MBOE, a \n491,387\n MBOE increase over the reserve estimate at December 31, 2023 of \n681,231\n MBOE. \nThe following table includes the changes in PUD reserves for 2024 (MBOE):\nBeginning proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2023\n681,231\n \nUndeveloped reserves transferred to developed\n(\n305,616\n)\nRevisions\n(\n50,767\n)\nPurchases\n633,382\n \nDivestitures\n(\n11,017\n)\nExtensions and discoveries\n225,405\n \nEnding proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2024\n1,172,618\n \nThe increase in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to extensions of \n215,557\n MBOE from \n445\n gross (\n409\n net) wells in which the Company has a working interest and \n9,848\n MBOE from \n447\n gross wells in which Viper owns royalty interests. Of the \n445\n gross working interest wells, \n426\n were in the Midland Basin and \n19\n were in the Delaware Basin. Transfers of \n305,616\n MBOE from undeveloped to developed reserves were the result of drilling or participating in \n290\n gross (\n270\n net) horizontal wells in which the Company has a working interest and \n222\n gross wells in which the Company also has a royalty interest or mineral interest through Viper. Downward revisions of \n50,767\n MBOE were primarily the result of negative revisions of \n37,218\n MBOE due to downgrades related to changes in the corporate development plan, and negative revisions of \n13,549\n MBOE attributable to lower commodity prices. Purchases of \n633,382\n MBOE consisted of \n628,469\n MBOE primarily from the Endeavor Acquisition and \n4,913\n MBOE from the Viper Tumbleweed Acquisitions and other insignificant royalty interest purchases.\nDuring 2024, approximately $\n3.0\n billion in capital expenditures went toward the development of proved undeveloped reserves, which includes drilling, completion and other facility costs associated with developing proved undeveloped wells. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUDs are projected to be approximately $\n2.1\n billion in 2025, $\n2.3\n billion in 2026, $\n1.3\n billion in 2027 and $\n1.2\n billion in 2028. Since our formation in \n120\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n2011, our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced, and we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert PUDs into proved developed reserves in upcoming years.\nWith our current development plan, we expect to continue our strong PUD conversion ratio in 2025 by converting an estimated \n33\n% of our PUDs to a proved developed category and developing approximately \n78\n% of the consolidated 2024 year-end PUD reserves by the end of 2027. As of December 31, 2024, all of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be developed within \nfive years\n from the date they were initially recorded. \nStandardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is based on the unweighted arithmetic average, first-day-of-the-month price for the rolling 12-month period. The projections should not be viewed as realistic estimates of future cash flows, nor should the “standardized measure” be interpreted as representing current value to the Company. Material revisions to estimates of proved reserves may occur in the future; development and production of the reserves may not occur in the periods assumed; actual prices realized are expected to vary significantly from those used; and actual costs may vary. \nThe following table sets forth the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows attributable to the Company’s proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nFuture cash inflows\n$\n157,944\n \n$\n106,418\n \n$\n137,051\n \nFuture development costs\n(1)\n(\n9,992\n)\n(\n6,400\n)\n(\n6,176\n)\nFuture production costs\n(\n44,097\n)\n(\n25,656\n)\n(\n25,295\n)\nFuture production taxes\n(\n10,975\n)\n(\n7,434\n)\n(\n9,927\n)\nFuture income tax expenses\n(\n16,115\n)\n(\n11,067\n)\n(\n17,563\n)\nFuture net cash flows\n76,765\n \n55,861\n \n78,090\n \n10% discount to reflect timing of cash flows\n(\n36,932\n)\n(\n28,803\n)\n(\n42,391\n)\nStandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows\n(2)\n$\n39,833\n \n$\n27,058\n \n$\n35,699\n \n(1)  Includes approximately $\n1.3\n billion, $\n685\n million, and $\n756\n million of  undiscounted future asset retirement costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, based on estimates made at the end of each of the respective years,\n(2)    Includes $\n3.3\n billion, $\n3.2\n billion and $\n3.5\n billion, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, attributable to the Company’s consolidated subsidiary, Viper, in which there is a \n55\n%, \n44\n% and \n44\n% non-controlling interest at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \nThe table below presents the SEC Prices as adjusted for differentials and contractual arrangements utilized in the computation of future cash inflows:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOil (per Bbl)\n$\n76.15\n \n$\n77.62\n \n$\n95.26\n \nNatural gas (per Mcf)\n$\n0.54\n \n$\n1.53\n \n$\n5.59\n \nNatural gas liquids (per Bbl)\n$\n22.02\n \n$\n24.40\n \n$\n39.40\n \n121\nTable of Contents\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nPrincipal changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows attributable to the Company’s proved reserves are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nStandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the beginning of the period\n$\n27,058\n \n$\n35,699\n \n$\n18,717\n \nSales of oil and natural gas, net of production costs\n(\n7,820\n)\n(\n6,544\n)\n(\n8,045\n)\nAcquisitions of reserves\n21,639\n \n1,854\n \n1,473\n \nDivestitures of reserves\n(\n1,318\n)\n(\n938\n)\n(\n119\n)\nExtensions and discoveries, net of future development costs\n4,124\n \n5,771\n \n7,674\n \nPreviously estimated development costs incurred during the period\n1,447\n \n1,180\n \n823\n \nNet changes in prices and production costs\n(\n4,969\n)\n(\n17,276\n)\n17,785\n \nChanges in estimated future development costs\n1,066\n \n518\n \n(\n317\n)\nRevisions of previous quantity estimates\n(\n2,035\n)\n(\n1,268\n)\n102\n \nAccretion of discount\n3,921\n \n4,533\n \n2,183\n \nNet change in income taxes\n(\n3,156\n)\n2,506\n \n(\n4,904\n)\nNet changes in timing of production and other\n(\n124\n)\n1,023\n \n327\n \nStandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the end of the period\n$\n39,833\n \n$\n27,058\n \n$\n35,699\n \n122\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n. Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have established disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nAs of December 31, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n. Management’s assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities acquired in the Endeavor Acquisition on September 10, 2024. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. The Company is in the process of integrating Endeavor’s and our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result of these integration activities, certain controls will be evaluated and may be changed. Except as noted above, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.\n123\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of our Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework, management did not identify any material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management’s assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities acquired in the Endeavor Acquisition on September 10, 2024.  The total assets and revenues of Endeavor represent approximately 54% and 16% of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nGrant Thornton LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2024. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2024, is included in this Item under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”\n124\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nDiamondback Energy, Inc.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting \nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Diamondback Energy, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nOur audit of, and opinion on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of Endeavor Energy Resources, LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 54 and 16 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. As indicated in Management’s Report, Endeavor Energy Resources, LP was acquired during 2024. Management’s assertion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of Endeavor Energy Resources, LP.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma \nFebruary 26, 2025 \n125\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.
