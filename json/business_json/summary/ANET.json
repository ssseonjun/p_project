Customers include large cloud customers or Cloud and AI Titans, other internet and service providers, including financial services and government agencies . We continue to diversify the types of customers we serve to and have continued to expand our presence across a wide spectrum of industries .\n Public cloud leaders pioneered the development of large-scale cloud data centers to meet these growing demands from their users . Enterprises now have the option to move applications to the cloud as cloud services are generally easier and more cost effective to deploy, scale and operate than traditional applications . The expansion of generative AI computing and distributed applications is further pushing the boundary of predictable scale and performance in the network .\n Arista provides network switching products intended to provide a robust interconnect that seamlessly links GPUs, compute and storage to deliver fast job completion time for training and generative AI workloads . Arista also offers customers the Arista Autonomous Virtual Assist which uses natural processing language to provide AI-assisted outcomes for network operations, security and observability .\n Arista offers a full suite of security solutions built on the foundations of our unified operating system in EOS and the common management plane in CloudVision™ . These solutions map to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s Zero Trust Maturity Model and help organizations accelerate their journey toward optimal zero trust maturity . The introduction of large scale, highly complex, public cloud environments and the digital transformation of customer business models meant .\n Historically, most common network designs were rigidly hierarchical, based on a 3-tiered model developed in the early days of the internet for sparse north/south traffic patterns . This model was limited in the number of devices that could be connected to a network and introduced many points of congestion as customers tried to scale the solution . As demand for scale and performance increased, the end-user experience was degraded .\n In post-pandemic world, enterprise campus networks must cope with an increasing number of endpoint IoT devices and remote work locations that require users to be connected from virtually anywhere . Campus administrators have sought to address the resulting increased network complexities and bottlenecks . Legacy networking has long suffered from limitations in network visibility largely due to inefficient polling mechanisms that only provide a limited subset of data .\n Our cloud networking innovations started with pioneering Arista EOS, which provides switching, routing, state-streaming and telemetry functions across all Arista platforms . EOS established a new standard in networking for large-scale cloud operators, opened the door to the widespread adoption of merchant silicon hardware in networks . The key benefits of our cloud networking solutions are as follows: Capacity, Performance and Scale .\n Arista’s strategic commitment to using merchant silicon is also a key competitive differentiator for Arista in addressing capacity demands . EOS publish-subscribe architecture provides self-healing resiliency through live patching, upgrades, fault isolation and containment . Customers demand open, standards-based networking that avoids vendor lock-in and enables third-party integration .\n Arista EOS and CloudVision bring a modern approach to network telemetry and a replacement for legacy polling mechanisms . EOS natively supports Ansible, CFEngine, Chef, Puppet, virtual network orchestration applications and third-party management tools . Arista's integrated security toolset uses the underlying network infrastructure from switches to WAN routers to deliver key security capabilities .\n Cognitive Campus is based on a data driven architecture and offers consistent, unified management across the campus edge for wired and wireless networks . Customers want a network that minimizes planned and unplanned downtime . Arista’s standards-based offerings minimize the learning curve for operators both in the wired and the wireless space .\n The company has developed a highly scalable cloud networking platform that uses software to address the needs of large-scale cloud companies, cloud service providers, and large enterprises, including AI, virtualization, big data and low-latency applications . Arista also provides identity-based micro segmentation (\"Arista MSS\") to ensure the zero trust posture extends to every critical asset within the organization .\n EOS software has allowed us to rapidly deliver new features and applications while preserving the structural integrity and quality of our network operating system . We believe our ability to deliver new capabilities more quickly than legacy switch/router operators provides us with a strategic advantage given that the requirements in cloud and next-generation data center and campus networking continue to evolve rapidly .\n Arista offers one of the broadest product portfolios of data-driven, high-speed, cloud and data center Ethernet switches . The Arista 7800R AI Spine, 7060 AI Leaf and the Distributed Etherlink Switch (\"DES\") are designed to address the demanding scale and performance requirements driven by large-scale AI networks .\n A-scalable, intelligent distributed system engineered to meet the demands of large-scale AI and machine learning environments .
