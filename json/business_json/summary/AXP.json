  "item1_summary": " This section highlights certain risks that could affect us and our businesses . Business and economic conditions are a major driver of our results of operations . Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business . We offer a broad array of products and services to consumers, smal .\n Slow economic growth or shifts in broader trends significantly impact consumer and business trends . The ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us, demand for fee-based products and services is dependent on the level of demand for payment and financing products . A sustained period of high inflation may erode certain of our expenses and erode consumer purchasing power .\n Our business is subject to the effects of geopolitical conditions, weather, natural disasters and other catastrophic events . The consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the economic environment generally can be sudden and severe . Political and social conditions, including geopolitical instability, fiscal and monetary policies, could also negatively affect our business . Pandemics and other health emergencies can have widespread and unpredictable impacts on global society .\n A number of actions are taking place across the globe that impact geopolitical stability . Several countries are considering or have implemented tariffs or other trade barriers . There are multiple ongoing military conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts) and geopolitical tensions may result in additional conflicts or escalate existing conflicts . The broader consequences remain uncertain, but geopolitical conditions may adversely affect macroeconomic conditions and our business .\n Hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters have impacted, and may continue to impact, spending and credit performance in the areas affected . Disasters and catastrophic events could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and infrastructure, including our technology and systems . Climate-related risks may exacerbate certain of these threats, including the frequency and severity of weather-related events .\n Some of the world's largest card networks may not be able to compete as well as others . They may have greater resources to compete with each other, such as increased competition from other networks . Some of those networks may have more access to the card industry than they do to each other . This could lead to increased competition in the card market, which is growing .\n Spending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing usage of credit and debit cards issued on other networks and real-time settlement transactions, such as bank transfers, as well as adoption of alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products . The competitive value of our data and demand for our products and services may also be diminished as traditional and non-traditional payment methods are not accepted .\n Competitors have sought to create their own integrated payments platforms, and may have competitive advantages in doing so as compared to our competitors . More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at risk . We may need to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements, particularly those that are not regulated .\n In the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries . We work with partners such as Delta, Hilton, Marriott and British Airways to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses . We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements .\n We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships . We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending . Billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships .\n The loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations . The risk of reputational issues could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners .\n Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners . We also face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us . We may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in revenue levels .\n We are exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations, operational outages, cybersecurity incidents and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business . Spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 7 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024 .\n We face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment, as well as the risk of losing merchant relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business . We face pressure from competitors that primarily rely on sources of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower costs that can make their pricing for card acceptance more attractive .\n Some large merchants may be able to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as traditional and new technology platforms . Card Members may not succeed in offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates . Non-traditional players in the alternative payment space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our merchant discount rate .\n In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen an increase in merchant surcharging on American Express cards . We also encounter merchants that tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards . American Express has increasingly relied on merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of our merchant relationships .\n Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on card usage . The impact could vary depending on the type of card, product, network, acquirer or acquirer . There can be no guarantee that American Express will continue to be effective in promoting card usage, or control the costs of such investments .\n Expanding our product and service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements . Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards . Failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability .\n We may not be able to manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future . Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, and merchant acceptance . Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters — even if related to seemingly isolated incidents — could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients .\n Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information . The speed with which information spreads through social media, enhanced technology and other news sources and the ease with which customers transact may amplify the onset and negative effects from such perceptions .\n \"Risks to our reputation\" include the creation of artificial artificial intelligence technology . The risk of this type of technology is that it could be used to create false representations of the public image . The public image could be affected by the public's perception of the world's most powerful institutions, such as the U.S. government .\n In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business . We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our existing technology . Our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted by consumers, merchants or service providers than ours .\n The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has increased rapidly with the increasing sophistication and applications of the technology . The complexity of these technologies can make it difficult to assess proper operation, reduce error, or understand and explain their outputs . Adverse consequences of such technologies remain uncertain but could include flaws in the decisions, predictions, outputs or analysis such technologies produce .\n We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected . We have acquired a number of businesses and continue to evaluate potential transactions . There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment opportunities accurately .\n Expanding to new businesses, geographies or customer types through acquisitions may subject us to new risks . It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all . We have been and may in the future be involved in litigation with our joint venture partners .\n GBTG also supports certain of our strategic partnerships and our Commercial Services business . Business decisions or other actions or omissions of a joint venture partner, other shareholders or management of our joint ventures may adversely affect the value of our investment or any commercial benefit to us from the relationship . The ability to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets may be limited in certain jurisdictions .\n Failure to monitor and control access to data in our systems could result in errors . Failure to comply with laws, rules, regulations, procedures and procedures could lead to errors . As we grow in size, new products and services are introduced, we may not identify or address new risks . We need to address and enhance our control of our control system .\n A number of threats have arisen from external parties who knowingly engage in or enable malicious activities, including phishing, social engineering attacks and other attacks . These threats are likely to continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, and can lead to diminished ability to pay for damages .\n Cyber threat actors, including state-sponsored and nation state actors, have rapidly evolved their techniques and increasingly utilize advanced capabilities, including the integration of advanced forms of artificial intelligence and other new technology . Financial services providers have been the target of attacks, such as denial of service attacks, social engineering and impersonation of current or prospective employees and contractors .\n The possibility of information, operational and cybersecurity incidents, malicious social engineering, password mismanagement, corporate espionage, fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely . We are aware that certain of our third-party service providers and joint ventures have been the victims of ransomware and other cyberattacks, in some instances that affected our data or services provided to them .\n Information, operational or cybersecurity incidents, fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, availability of services and data, privacy and/or security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention . The disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources .\n The uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success . A significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations . Disruptions or degradations have had, and will likely continue to have, wide-reaching consequences, including the potential to disrup . Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements .\n Service disruptions or degradations impacting us or our partners can prevent access to online services and account information, compromise or limit access to company or customer data . Any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services . We face significantly heightened regulatory expectations and scrutiny in the U.S. and globally, which significantly affects our business .\n Political developments can result in legislative and regulatory uncertainty and changes to supervisory and enforcement priorities . Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other’s approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry . In 2024, we became a Category III firm for purposes of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ tailoring framework .\n Regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business . There is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU . Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties .\n Legislators and regulators continue to focus on consumer protection, including product design and pricing constructs, account management and security, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, marketing and debt collection practices . Any new requirements or increased enforcement of existing requirements could adversely impact revenue growth and profitability . As regulators increase their focus in these areas, new technologies such as digital currencies develop, digital currency develop, near real-time money develops .\n Our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny . Errors, failures in compliance programs can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits . Our reputation may suffer due to our customers’ association with certain countries, persons or entities .\n At any given time, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits, mass arbitrations and similar actions . The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions . We expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny .\n A violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other agencies of the same or similar practices by us . External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries . Regulatory scrutiny has continued to increase in a number of areas, and regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties .\n An adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations . We are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings, arbitrations and proposed class actions, challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements . Visa and Mastercard proposed a lawsuit settlement agreement that would have, among other things, required reductions and caps on interchange fees .\n We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses . These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business . As outsourcing, specialization of functions and technology innovation within the payments industry increase, more third parties are involved in processing card transactions .\n The management and oversight of an increasing number of third parties increases our operational complexity and governance challenges . Third parties may face similar or greater risks as us, including as a result of their relationship with us . Failure to exercise adequate oversight over third parties could result in regulatory actions, fines, litigation, sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us .\n Success is dependent on maintaining a culture of integrity and respect, and misconduct by or loss of personnel could materially adversely affect our business . The unexpected loss of key personnel could disrupt our business and have an adverse impact on future performance . Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to employ colleagues in the location(s) of our choice .\n New York City is home to a new generation of young people who want to learn how to manage their own lives . The city has been in a state of emergency called the National Institute of Public Service (NPS) for more than two decades . The state of New York is in the process of developing a new state of mind for the first time in a decade .\n In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, data management, artificial intelligence and machine learning and information security and cybersecurity . Failure to comply with such laws or to maintain sufficient governance and control structures could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations .\n The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions . Competitors or other third parties may allege that our products, systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property . Tax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition .\n We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) We believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions . New guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will impact how multinational enterprises are taxed on their global profits .\n Our operations, business, customers and partners could be adversely affected by climate-related risks . We face physical risks related to climate, including rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters . Changes in consumer preferences, travel patterns and legal requirements could impact revenues or expenses .\n Models may not be accurate predictors of future outcomes . Models that leverage artificial intelligence are subject to additional risks such as biased or inaccurate results . Models for credit loss accounting under Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) and Membership Rewards require us to make difficult decisions about how to use our models to manage our finances .\n We are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us . Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons . A customer’s ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic, market, political and social conditions .\n RBCP: Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs . Default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud . Higher write-off rates and resulting increase in reserves for credit losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds .\n Interest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings . Increased credit risk could require us to increase provisions for losses . We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change as benchmark interest rates change . We are subject to capital adequa. s on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations and re-age guidance . For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see “Risk Management .\n Failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, or the OCC with respect to AENB . Some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions .\n Regulators have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice . We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and such dividends may be limited by law, regulation or supervisory policy . If we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, including the stress capital buffer, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted .\n The future reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our stock . Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business . Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements .\n Any reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets . Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions . We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls .\n Political and economic conditions could continue to cause changes in the values of currencies . A further strengthening of the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our net revenues . We continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances .\n The use of social media and similar channels has the potential to intensify and accelerate such a decrease in confidence in soundness . The value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions . As of December 31, 2024, we held approximately $1.2 billion of investment securities, primarily consisting of debt securities, and equity investments, including certain equity method investments .\n Defaults, threats of defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us . We define information security and cybersecurity risk as the risk that the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information and information systems are impacted by unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction .\n The TRIS program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology, employs a highly trained team of experts . The program deploys multiple layers of controls, including embedding security into our technology investments . Those controls are measured and monitored by a combination of subject matter experts and a security operations center with integrated cyber detection, response and recovery capabilities .\n Cybersecurity risks related to third parties are managed as part of our Third Party Management Policy . We do not believe that our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition have been materially adversely affected by any cybersecurity incidents . We continue to assess the risks and changes in the cyber environment, invest in enhancements to our cybersecurity capabilities, and engage in industry and government forums .\n A major information or cybersecurity incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure . The Board and Risk Committee are primarily responsible for overseeing and governing the development, implementation and maintenance of our TRIS program . The ORMC escalates risks to our Enterprise Risk Management Committee .\n Our Chief Risk Officer leads the strategy, engineering and operations of cybersecurity across the Company .
