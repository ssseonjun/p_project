    "item1": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nThe following represents a discussion of risk factors relevant to Grainger’s business that could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, along with the accuracy of forward-looking statements.  The risks included below are not exhaustive. As Grainger operates in a rapidly changing environment, it is not possible for management to predict all risks and the corresponding impact of each such risk or a combination of risks. The presented risks and any new risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which Grainger is exposed.\nIndustry and Market Risks\nInflation could cause Grainger's operating and administrative expenses to grow more rapidly than net sales, which could result in lower gross margins and lower net earnings\n.\nMarket variables, such as inflation of product costs, labor rates, fuel, freight and energy costs, as well as geopolitical events, could negatively impact Grainger's ability to effectively manage its operating and administrative expenses. For example, geopolitical conflicts and related international responses have and may continue to exacerbate inflationary pressures, including increases in fuel and other energy costs. Additionally, climate-related policies, carbon pricing mechanisms, and regulations aimed at reducing emissions may increase energy and raw material costs, which could put additional pressure on Grainger’s margins. Inflation may also reduce demand for products, resulting in lower sales volumes. In addition, Grainger's inability to pass on increases in costs to customers in a timely manner, or at all, could cause Grainger's operating and administrative expenses to grow more rapidly than net sales, which could result in lower gross profit margins and lower net earnings.\nDisruptions in Grainger’s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nGrainger’s logistics or supply chain network could be disrupted by the occurrence of: one or more natural or weather-related disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, hurricanes, floods, fires, droughts, tornados and other extreme weather events or conditions; longer-term climate shifts that affect transportation infrastructure or material availability; pandemic diseases or viral contagions; geopolitical events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which Grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located; disruptions to transportation infrastructure and networks, including from transport providers or third-party work stoppages related to labor strikes or lockouts; and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increases in costs associated with international trade. \nEven when Grainger is able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require Grainger to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact Grainger's profitability and financial condition. For example, disruptions to global transportation networks, such as rising sea levels impacting ports or extreme weather damaging logistics hubs, could increase delays and costs. Any of these circumstances could impair Grainger's ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, penalties or damage to Grainger's reputation. Grainger’s ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of Grainger’s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance.\nFurther escalation of geopolitical tensions across the world and potential actions taken in response to them could have a broad impact on markets where Grainger does business, adversely affect its suppliers and disrupt the sourcing, manufacturing and transportation of products. It is not possible to predict whether certain geopolitical events which could adversely affect Grainger's business will occur, or the broader consequences of these events if they did occur, which could include further instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on the global economy or possible sanctions, embargoes or other trade barriers.\nWeakness in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of Grainger’s customers could negatively impact Grainger’s sales growth and results of operations.\nEconomic, political and industry trends affect Grainger’s business environment. Grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending and demand for products and services of Grainger’s customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods \n 12\nsold, currency exchange rates, interest rate fluctuations, government spending and government shutdowns, economic downturns, recessions, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, work stoppages, natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, outbreaks of pandemic disease, inflation, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond Grainger’s control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.\nAny of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from Grainger or impair the ability of Grainger’s customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on Grainger’s pricing and terms of sale. Accordingly, a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in Canada, Japan, Mexico, the U.K., the U.S. or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact Grainger’s sales and results of operations.\nUnexpected product shortages, tariffs, product cost increases and risks associated with Grainger’s suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nGrainger's products are purchased from more than 5,000 primary suppliers located in various countries around the world, not one of which accounted for more than 5% of total purchases. \nDisruptions in procuring sources of supply could occur due to factors beyond Grainger’s control. These factors could include economic downturns, recessions, outbreaks of pandemic disease, natural or human induced disasters, cybersecurity attacks, extreme weather, geopolitical unrest, new, threatened or increased tariffs, trade issues and policies, detention orders or withhold release orders on imported products, labor problems or shortages experienced by Grainger’s suppliers or others in the supply chain, transportation availability, staffing and cost, shortage of raw materials, supplier consolidation, unilateral product cost increases by suppliers of products in short supply, inflation and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in Grainger’s product costs.\nFurther, Grainger sources products from Asia and other areas of the world. This increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required, distances involved, and the range of potential consequences of various geopolitical risks. If Grainger was unable to promptly replace sources of supply that become disrupted, there could be adverse effects on inventory levels, results of operations, customer relationships and Grainger’s reputation. In addition, Grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event Grainger was unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing arrangements which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.\nFor products sold in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, Grainger requires its suppliers and sub-suppliers, to comply with Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics, or other similar responsible sourcing standards, as a condition of doing business with Grainger. Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics focuses on four main areas of ethical sourcing: (i) human rights and labor standards (including prohibitions on child and forced labor); (ii) environment, health and safety; (iii) sanctions, trade, bribery and corruption; and (iv) privacy and information security. The Code also addresses how to report potential Code violations and related concerns. Grainger does not control its suppliers and their sub-suppliers, and neither Grainger nor its suppliers or other partners may be able to uncover all instances of noncompliance with Grainger’s Supplier Code of Ethics and ethical and lawful business practices. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations, product recalls, or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Grainger’s brand and lead to adverse effects on Grainger’s business. \nVolatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins.\nSome of Grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives, rare earth minerals, or other materials or inputs required to manufacture certain products and are subject to price changes based on fluctuations in the commodities market. Certain policies, including carbon pricing, emissions trading systems, and regulations limiting industrial emissions, may further contribute to cost fluctuations for fuel, energy, and raw materials.\nFurther changes in U.S. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs) and retaliatory actions by U.S. trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions. The level of demand for Grainger's products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of raw materials and commodities, including fuel. For example, climate-related regulations on transportation emissions could increase fuel costs, \n 13\nthereby impacting the cost of product distribution. Fluctuations in the price of fuel or increased demand for freight services could affect transportation costs. Grainger’s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions. The inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could reduce demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes. \nFluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations.\nGrainger’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the Financial Statements of Grainger’s subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, Grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of Grainger’s international subsidiaries, primarily the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, and British pound sterling, arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency exchange rate is driven by a variety of macroeconomic factors and fiscal decisions of various governments and central banks, all over which Grainger has no control. Grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales, costs and cash flows. These fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have affected and may continue to affect Grainger’s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings.\nThe facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive, and changes in competition and other risks could increase our costs, impact demand for Grainger’s products and services or impact the profitability of our business.\nGrainger competes in a variety of ways, including product assortment and availability, services offered to customers, pricing, purchasing convenience and the overall experience Grainger offers. This includes the ease of use of Grainger’s high-touch operations, eCommerce platforms and delivery of products.\nThere are several large competitors in the industry, as well as small local and regional competitors. Grainger faces competition from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to customers, wholesale distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and online businesses.\nTo remain competitive, Grainger must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. Downward pressure on sales prices, changes in the volume of orders, and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could cause Grainger’s gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline. Grainger may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. These pressures could have a material effect on Grainger’s sales and profitability. \nTo manage these potential pressures, Grainger continuously considers the adoption of new operating initiatives, including new marketing programs, productivity improvements, inventory management and loss prevention initiatives, practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and other similar strategies. If Grainger is unable to sustain or grow sales, reduce costs, and prevent loss and fraud, among other actions, Grainger's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nMoreover, Grainger expects technological advancements, innovations and the increased use of eCommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, Grainger’s ability to effectively compete requires Grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments. Developing, upgrading, managing or implementing new technologies, including AI, business applications, strategies and innovations may require significant investment of resources by Grainger, may result in unexpected costs and disruptions to operations, may take longer than expected, may increase Grainger's vulnerability to cyber breaches, attacks or intrusions, and may not provide all anticipated benefits.\nChanges in customer base or product mix could cause changes in Grainger’s revenue or gross margin, or affect Grainger’s competitive position.\nFrom time to time, Grainger experiences changes in its customer base and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions and divestitures, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, competition and the increased use of eCommerce by Grainger and its competitors.\n 14\nIn addition, Grainger has entered, and may in the future continue to enter, into contracts with group purchasing organizations (GPOs) that aggregate the buying power of their member customers in negotiating selling prices. If Grainger is unable to enter into, or sustain, contractual arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with GPOs, Grainger's results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs its customer base and product mix change over time, Grainger must identify new products, product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs. The inability to introduce new products and services and effectively integrate them into Grainger’s existing assortment could have a negative impact on future sales growth and Grainger’s competitive position. The inclusion of Grainger-branded products in the product assortment could subject Grainger to increased claims and litigation activity. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights, including against the manufacturer of such products, may be insufficient or unavailable to protect Grainger against potential loss exposures.\nGrainger’s common stock may be subject to volatility or price declines.\nThe trading prices and volumes of Grainger’s common stock may be subject to broad and unpredictable fluctuations due to changes in economic, political and market conditions, the financial results and business strategies of Grainger and its competitors, changes in expectations as to Grainger’s future financial or operating performance, including estimates by securities analysts and investors, Grainger’s failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements provided to the public, speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or investment community or by groups of individual investors, changes in capital structure, share repurchases or dividends, economic decline, political unrest or geopolitical conflict, outbreak of pandemic disease, and a number of other factors, including those discussed in this",
