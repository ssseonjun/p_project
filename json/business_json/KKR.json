    "item1": "ITEM 1.  BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are a leading global investment firm that offers alternative asset management as well as capital markets and insurance solutions. We aim to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and supporting growth in our portfolio companies and communities. We sponsor funds that invest in private equity, credit, and real assets and have strategic partners that manage hedge funds. Our insurance subsidiaries offer retirement, life, and reinsurance products under the management of Global Atlantic. \nOur asset management business offers a broad range of investment management services to fund investors around the world. Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 770 private equity investments in portfolio companies with a total transaction value in excess of $790 billion as of December 31, 2024. Since the inception of our firm in 1976, we have expanded our investment strategies and product offerings from traditional private equity to areas such as leveraged credit, alternative credit, infrastructure, energy, real estate, growth equity (including technology, health care, and impact strategies), and core private equity. We also provide capital markets services for our firm, our portfolio companies, and third parties. Our balance sheet provides a significant source of capital for the growth and expansion of our business, which has allowed us to further align our interests with those of our investment vehicle investors. Building on these efforts and leveraging our industry expertise and intellectual capital have allowed us to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source.\nOur insurance business is operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary Global Atlantic, which is a leading retirement and life insurance company that provides a broad suite of protection, legacy and savings products, and reinsurance solutions to clients across individual and institutional markets. Global Atlantic primarily offers individuals fixed-rate annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, and targeted life products through a network of banks, broker-dealers, and independent marketing organizations. Global Atlantic provides its institutional clients customized reinsurance solutions, including block, flow, and pension risk transfer reinsurance, as well as funding agreements. Global Atlantic primarily generates income by earning a spread between its investment income and the cost of policyholder benefits. As of December 31, 2024, Global Atlantic served over three and a half million policyholders.\nOur Strategic Holdings business is currently comprised of the firm’s ownership in the businesses we acquired through our participation in our core private equity strategy.  In our core private equity strategy, our objective is to acquire and manage controlling interests in operating companies, which we intend to hold over a longer period of time and that we believe have a lower anticipated risk profile than our investments in businesses acquired through our traditional private equity strategy.  As of December 31, 2024, our Strategic Holdings segment consisted of our ownership stakes in 18 companies that we acquired through our core private equity strategy. \nOur Firm\nWe seek to work proactively and collaboratively across business lines, departments, and geographies, as appropriate, to achieve what we believe are the best investment results for our clients and the firm. Through our offices around the world, we have a pre-eminent global integrated platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital, and carrying out capital markets  activities. We have multilingual and multicultural investment teams with local market knowledge and significant business, investment, and operational experience in the countries in which we invest. We believe that our global capabilities and one-firm philosophy have been critical to our success, including enabling us to raise substantial capital, capture a greater number of investment opportunities, and assist our portfolio companies in their increasing reliance on global markets and sourcing, and have also facilitated the diversification of our operations.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThough our operations span multiple continents and asset classes, our investment professionals are supported by an integrated infrastructure and operate under a common set of principles and business practices that are monitored by a variety of committees. Our investment teams operate with a single culture that rewards investment discipline, creativity, determination, and patience, and emphasizes the sharing of information, resources, expertise and best practices across offices and asset classes. When appropriate, we staff investment transactions across multiple offices and businesses in order to take advantage of the industry-specific expertise of our investment professionals, and we hold regular meetings in which investment professionals throughout our offices share their knowledge and experiences. We believe that the ability to draw on the local cultural fluency of our investment professionals while maintaining a centralized and integrated global infrastructure and strategic focus distinguishes us from other investment firms and has been a substantial contributing factor to our ability to raise funds, invest internationally, and expand our businesses.\nOur Business\nWe operate in three segments: our asset management business, our insurance business, and our strategic holdings business. \nAsset Management\nIn our asset management business, we have five business lines: (1) Private Equity, (2) Real Assets, (3) Credit and Liquid Strategies, (4) Capital Markets, and (5) Principal Activities. Information about our business lines below should be read together with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nAs an asset management firm, we earn fees, including management fees and incentive fees, and carried interest for providing investment management and other services to our investment vehicles, CLOs, managed accounts, portfolio companies, and certain operating companies, and we generate transaction fees from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income by investing our own capital alongside investors in our investment vehicles and from other assets on our balance sheet. Carried interest we receive from our funds and certain other investment vehicles entitles us to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested. Our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are able to utilize a substantial and diversified capital base; an integrated global investment platform; the expertise of operating professionals, senior advisors, and other advisors; and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. These teams invest capital, a substantial portion of which is of a long duration or not subject to predetermined redemption requirements, which provides us with significant flexibility to grow investments and select exit opportunities. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 93% of our AUM consists of capital that is either not subject to redemption for at least 8 years from inception or what we refer to as perpetual capital. For more information about the limitations of perpetual capital, please see \"—Risks Related to Our Business—AUM, referred to as perpetual capital, is subject to material reduction, including through withdrawal, redemption or dividends, and termination\" in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report. We believe that these aspects of our business help us continue to grow our asset management business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions.\nSince our inception, one of our fundamental investment philosophies has been to align the interests of the firm and our employees with the interests of our fund investors, portfolio companies, and other stakeholders. We achieve this by putting our own capital behind our ideas. As of December 31, 2024, we and our employees and other personnel have approximately $28.6 billion invested in or committed to our own funds and portfolio companies, including $12.2 billion of capital funded from our balance sheet, $11.0 billion of additional capital committed by our balance sheet to our investment funds and other investment vehicles, $4.2 billion funded from personal investments, and $1.2 billion of additional capital commitments from personal investments.  \n9\nTable of Contents\nPrivate Equity\nOverview\nThrough our Private Equity business line, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic non-controlling minority positions. In addition to our traditional private equity funds that invest in large and mid-sized companies, we sponsor funds that invest in core private equity and growth equity, which includes technology, health care, and impact strategies. Our Private Equity business line includes separately managed accounts that invest in multiple strategies, which may include our credit and real assets strategies, as well as our private equity strategies. These funds and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC-registered investment adviser. As of December 31, 2024, our Private Equity business line had $195.4 billion of AUM, consisting of $139.9 billion in traditional private equity, $37.4 billion in core private equity, and $18.1 billion in growth equity. \nWe are a world leader in private equity, having raised over 30 private equity funds. We invest in industry-leading franchises and attract world-class management teams. Our investment approach leverages our capital base, sourcing advantage, global network, and industry knowledge. It also leverages a sizable team of operating professionals, as well as senior advisors and other advisors, many of whom are former chief executive officers and leaders of the business community. \nOur Private Equity business line consists of the following strategies:\nTraditional Private Equity.\n  Our traditional private equity investment strategy typically seeks to engage in management buyouts, build-ups, or other investments with a view to acquire control or have significant influence. We believe that the combination of our industry knowledge, investment experience, and operational expertise provides KKR with the ability to identify and create value in investment opportunities. Through our portfolio company board oversight, we work closely and cooperatively with the management of our portfolio companies, which are assisted by having access to the resources of our global platform. Since 2022, we have offered a  middle market private equity strategy through our Ascendant fund.\nCore Private Equity.\n  Our core private equity strategy targets investments with a longer holding period and a lower anticipated risk profile than our traditional private equity investments. Our core private equity investments are made in companies that, among other things, we believe are more stable and less cyclical, and typically have lower average leverage over our holding period, than those in our traditional private equity funds.\nGrowth Equity.\n  Since 2016, we have offered growth equity funds that pursue growth equity investment opportunities in the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector in leading growth technology companies across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Israel. Through this strategy, we focus on emerging, high-growth companies and invest across a variety of sub-sectors including software, security, semiconductors, consumer electronics, internet of things (IoT), information services, business services, internet, digital media, content, and communications. \nSince 2016, we have offered growth equity funds to pursue growth equity investment opportunities in the health care sector, primarily in the United States and Europe. Our health care growth strategy targets opportunities across various health care sub-sectors, including biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, life science tools, health care providers, healthcare information technology, and other services. \nSince 2019, we have offered global impact funds, which are focused on identifying and investing behind opportunities across the Americas, Europe, and Asia where financial performance and societal impact are intrinsically aligned. Our global impact funds aim to generate private equity-like risk-adjusted returns by investing in small to medium-sized companies that contribute toward one or more of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. \n10\nTable of Contents\nPrivate Equity Assets Under Management and Select Fund Performance Information\nThe following chart presents the growth in the AUM of our Private Equity business line from December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2024.\nPrivate Equity\nAssets Under Management\n(1)\n($ in billions)\n(1)\nAUM of acquired businesses are included in the years in and after the completion of the respective acquisitions or transactions, as applicable. \n11\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2024, relating to our current private equity and other investment vehicles reported in our Private Equity business line for which we have the ability to earn carried interest.

For funds that initially charge management fees on the basis of committed capital, the end date is generally the date on or after which the management fees begin to be calculated instead on the basis of invested capital and may, for certain funds, begin to be calculated using a lower rate. For further information on management fee calculations, see Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in our financial statements.\n(3)\nThe commitment represents the aggregate capital commitments to the fund, including capital commitments by third-party fund investors and the general partner. Foreign currency commitments have been converted into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate that prevailed on December 31, 2024.\n(4)\nThe remaining cost represents the initial investment of the general partner and limited partners, reduced for returns of capital.\n(5)\nThe \"Invested\" and \"Realized\" columns do not include the amounts of any realized investments that restored the unused capital commitments of the fund investors, if any.\n(6)\n\"Unallocated Commitments\" represent commitments received from our strategic investor partnerships that have yet to be allocated to a particular investment strategy.\nTraditional Private Equity Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2024, our traditional private equity portfolio consisted of over 140 companies with approximately $345 billion of annual revenues. These companies are headquartered in over 30 countries and operate in a variety of industries, which take advantage of our broad and deep industry and operating expertise. Many of these companies are leading franchises with global operations, strong management teams, and attractive growth prospects, which we believe will provide benefits through a broad range of business conditions.\n12\nTable of Contents\nPrivate Equity Investment Process and Fund Characteristics \nInvestment Approach\nOur approach to making private equity investments focuses on achieving multiples of invested capital and attractive risk-adjusted IRRs by selecting high-quality investments that may be made at attractive prices, applying rigorous standards of due diligence when making investment decisions, implementing strategic and operational changes that drive growth and value creation in acquired businesses, carefully monitoring investments, and making informed decisions when developing investment exit strategies.\nWe believe that we have achieved a leading position in the private equity industry by applying a disciplined investment approach and by building strong partnerships with highly motivated management teams who put their own capital at risk. When making private equity investments, we seek out strong business franchises, attractive growth prospects, leading market positions, and the ability to generate attractive returns. In our private equity funds, we do not effect transactions that are \"hostile,\" meaning a target company's board of directors makes an unfavorable recommendation with respect to the transaction or publicly opposes the consummation of the transaction.\nSourcing and Selecting Investments\nWe have access to significant opportunities for making private equity investments as a result of our sizable capital base, global platform, and relationships with leading executives from major companies, commercial and investment banks, and other investment and advisory institutions. Members of our global network contact us with new investment opportunities, including a substantial number of exclusive investment opportunities and opportunities that are made available to only a limited number of other firms. We also proactively pursue business development strategies that are designed to generate deals internally based on the depth of our industry knowledge and our reputation as a leading financial sponsor.\nDue Diligence and the Investment Decision\nWhen an investment team determines that an investment proposal is worth consideration, the proposal is formally presented to the applicable investment committee and the due diligence process commences, if appropriate. The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances surrounding an investment and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational improvement and value creation. When conducting due diligence, investment teams evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental, social, governance, legal, and regulatory issues in order to determine whether an investment is suitable. While the due diligence process differs depending on the type of investment we make, generally, in connection with the private equity due diligence process, investment professionals spend significant amounts of time meeting with a company's management and operating personnel, visiting plants and facilities, and where appropriate, speaking with other stakeholders interested in and impacted by the investment in order to understand the opportunities and risks associated with the proposed investment. Our investment professionals may also use the services of outside accountants, consultants, lawyers, investment banks, and industry experts as appropriate to assist them in this process. Investment committees or portfolio managers, as applicable, monitor our due diligence practices and approve an investment before it is made.\nBuilding Successful and Competitive Businesses\nPortfolio management committees are responsible for working with our investment professionals from the date on which a private equity investment is made until the time it is exited in order to ensure that strategic and operational objectives are accomplished and that the performance of the investment is closely monitored. When investing in a private equity portfolio company, we partner with management teams to execute on our investment thesis, and we rigorously track performance through regular monitoring of detailed operational and financial metrics as well as appropriate environmental, social, and governance issues. We have developed a global network of experienced managers and operating professionals who assist the private equity portfolio companies in making operational improvements and achieving growth. We augment these resources with operational guidance from operating professionals at KKR Capstone, senior advisors, other advisors and investment teams, and with \"100-Day Plans\" that focus the firm's efforts and drive our strategies. We seek to emphasize efficient capital management, top-line growth, R&D spending, geographical expansion, cost optimization, and investment for the long-term. KKR has supported and expanded the implementation of broad-based employee ownership programs to its portfolio companies with the goal of improving financial performance through broad-based employee engagement and financial inclusion.\n13\nTable of Contents\nRealizing Investments\nWe have developed substantial expertise for realizing private equity investments. From our inception through December 31, 2024, the firm has generated approximately $208.1 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our Private Equity portfolio companies in initial public offerings and secondary offerings, dividends, and sales to strategic and financial buyers. When exiting private equity investments, our objective is to structure the exit in a manner that optimizes returns for fund investors and, in the case of publicly traded companies, minimizes the impact that the exit has on the trading price of the company's securities. We believe that our ability to successfully realize investments is attributable in part to the strength and discipline of our portfolio management committees and capital markets business, as well as the firm's longstanding relationships with corporate buyers and members of the investment banking and investing communities.\nPrivate Equity Fund Structures\nThe private equity funds that we sponsor and manage typically have finite lives and investment periods. Each fund is typically organized as one or more partnerships, and each partnership is controlled by a general partner. Private equity fund investors are limited partners who agree to contribute a specified amount of capital to the fund from time to time for use in qualifying investments during the investment period, which generally lasts up to six years depending on how quickly capital is deployed. The investment period for certain funds may be terminated upon supermajority vote (based on capital commitment) of the fund's limited partners or by the fund's advisory committee. The term of our private equity funds generally last for 10 to 12 years and may last up to 15 years from the date of the fund's first or last investment, subject to a limited number of extensions with the consent of the limited partners or the applicable advisory committee. Given the length of the investment periods and terms of our private equity funds and the limited conditions under which such periods can be terminated and commitments may be withdrawn, the AUM of our private equity funds provide a long-term stable capital base.\nEach private equity fund’s general partner is generally entitled to a carried interest that allocates to it 20% of the net profits realized by the limited partners from the fund’s investments. Our private equity funds since 2012 generally have a performance hurdle which requires that we return 7%, compounded annually, to limited partners in the fund prior to receiving our 20% share of net profits realized by limited partners. Such performance hurdles are subject to a catch-up allocation to the general partner after the hurdle has been reached. Our earlier private equity funds do not include a performance hurdle. The timing of receipt of carried interest in respect of investments of our private equity funds is dictated by the terms of the partnership agreements that govern such funds, and is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable, and is accruing carried interest; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a \"netting hole.\" See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity—Sources of Liquidity\" for a discussion of netting holes. Net realized profit or loss is not netted between or among funds. In addition, the agreements governing our private equity funds generally include a \"clawback\" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return or contribute amounts to the fund for distribution to fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Asset Management—Revenues—Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)\" and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The \"clawback\" provisions in the agreements governing our carry-paying funds may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require us to return or contribute amounts to our funds and fund investors.\"\nWe enter into management agreements with our private equity funds pursuant to which we receive management fees in exchange for providing the funds with management and other services. Gross management fees for our private equity funds generally range from 1% to 2% of committed capital during the fund's investment period and are generally 0.75% to 1.50% of invested capital after the expiration of the fund's investment period with subsequent reductions over time, which causes the fees to be reduced as investments are liquidated. In addition, in connection with the expiration of the investment period, a private equity fund may establish a reserve on its fund investors' capital commitments on which no fee is paid unless such capital is invested. Management fees are paid by private equity fund investors, who generally contribute capital to the fund in order to allow the fund to pay the fees to us. Our private equity funds generally require that the amount of management fees be subtracted from gains allocable to fund investors before a carried interest may be paid.\n14\nTable of Contents\nWe also enter into monitoring agreements with our portfolio companies pursuant to which we receive periodic monitoring fees in exchange for providing them with management, consulting, and other services, and we typically receive transaction fees for providing portfolio companies with financial, advisory, and other services in connection with specific transactions. Monitoring agreements may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control, if certain criteria are satisfied. In some cases, we may be entitled to other fees that are paid by an investment target upon closing of a transaction or when a potential investment is not consummated. Since 2014, our private equity fund agreements typically require us to share 100% of any monitoring, transaction, and other fees that are allocable to a fund (after reduction for expenses incurred allocable to a fund from unconsummated transactions) with fund investors.\nIn addition, the agreements governing our private equity funds enable investors in those funds to reduce their capital commitments available for further investments, on an investor-by-investor basis, in the event one or more \"key persons\" (for example, investment professionals who are named as \"key executives\" for certain geographically or product focused funds) cease to be actively involved in the management of the fund. While these provisions do not allow investors in our funds to withdraw capital that has been invested or cause a fund to terminate, the occurrence of a \"key person\" event could cause disruption in our business, reduce the amount of capital that we have available for future investments, and make it more challenging to raise additional capital in the future.\nBecause private equity fund investors typically are unwilling to invest their capital in a fund unless the fund's manager also invests its own capital in the fund's investments, our private equity fund documents generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to the funds. The amounts of these commitments, which are negotiated by fund investors, generally range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds (i) where we are pursuing newer strategies, (ii) where third party investor demand is limited, and (iii) where a larger commitment is consistent with our firm's asset allocation strategy. When investments are made, the general partner contributes capital to the fund based on its fund commitment percentage and acquires a capital interest in the investment that is not subject to a carried interest or management fees.\nReal Assets\nOverview\nThrough our Real Assets business line, we manage and sponsor a group of real assets funds and accounts that invest capital in infrastructure, real estate, or energy. These funds and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. or one of its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024, our Real Assets business line had $166.0 billion of AUM, consisting of $79.9 billion in infrastructure, $79.5 billion in real estate (of which $42.5 billion is real estate credit and $37.0 billion is real estate equity), $5.2 billion in energy, and $1.4 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic investment partnership.\nInfrastructure\nWe established a dedicated infrastructure team and strategy in 2008, focused on global investment opportunities with an emphasis on investments in assets and businesses located in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the \"OECD\"). In January 2020, we expanded our strategy to include investment opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. Our infrastructure platform seeks to achieve returns including current income through the acquisition and operational improvement of assets important to the functioning of the economy. We believe that the global infrastructure market provides an opportunity for the firm's private investment, operational improvement capabilities and stakeholder engagement. Through this platform we have made investments in sectors such as power and utilities, midstream, energy and energy transition, transportation, asset leasing, water and wastewater, telecommunications infrastructure, and social infrastructure. In 2020, we established the Diversified Core Infrastructure Fund as our first dedicated open-ended core infrastructure fund. Our diversified core infrastructure strategy seeks core infrastructure and infrastructure-related investment opportunities with a focus on investments with predominantly contracted or regulated cash flows in securities, properties, and other assets principally located in North America and Western Europe. In 2023, we established a climate-focused investment strategy, which invests in infrastructure solutions to support the global energy transition. This strategy seeks opportunities that have a combination of risk mitigation through infrastructure-like characteristics, such as hard assets and contracted cash flows. KKR Climate is a global platform that seeks to invest in companies and sectors across the entire physical economy, with a focus on OECD countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. \n15\nTable of Contents\nReal Estate\nOur real estate platform seeks to be a global solutions provider across the capital structure in the real estate industry, focusing on opportunities in the United States, Western Europe, and Asia-Pacific, including a broad range of investments such as property-level equity, debt and special situations transactions, and businesses with significant real estate holdings that can benefit from KKR’s operational expertise. We seek to partner with real estate owners, lenders, operators, and developers to provide flexible capital to respond to transaction-specific needs, including the acquisition or financing of existing assets or companies and the funding of future development or acquisition opportunities.  \nWe make real estate equity investments through opportunistic closed-end vehicles in residential and commercial assets. In addition, we have a core plus real estate strategy that seeks to pursue real estate investments through open-ended funds, primarily with the intent of having influence over the real estate assets or companies in which we make investments. We also source equity real estate investments for KKR Real Estate Select Trust Inc., a continuously offered, registered closed-end investment company, and U.S. real estate investment trust (\"KREST\"), and our Global Atlantic insurance companies. Our real estate credit platform provides capital solutions for real estate transactions with a focus on commercial mortgage-backed securities (\"CMBS\"), whole loans and subordinated debt. These strategies are deployed in a variety of ways, including through Global Atlantic, KKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc. (NYSE: KREF), a publicly listed U.S. real estate investment trust (\"KREF\"), and our real estate credit funds which focus on commercial real estate lending and the risk retention tranches of CMBS. Our global presence is strengthened by KJRM, one of the largest Japanese real estate asset managers in Japan. KJRM manages diversified real estate assets, including retail, office, and mixed used properties through two Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed real estate investment trusts: Japan Metropolitan Fund Investment Corporation and Industrial & Infrastructure Fund Investment Corporation. \nEnergy\nOur primary platform for pursuing upstream oil and natural gas opportunities is through Crescent Energy Company (“Crescent”), a publicly listed energy company (NYSE: CRGY), which we manage. Crescent is a U.S. independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition, development, and operation of oil and natural gas properties.   \n16\nTable of Contents\nReal Assets Under Management and Select Fund Performance Information\nThe following chart presents the growth in the AUM of our Real Assets business line from December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2024.\nReal Assets\nAssets Under Management \n(1)\n($ in billions)\n \n(1)\nAUM of acquired businesses are included in the years on and after the completion of the respective acquisitions or transactions, as applicable. \n17\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2024, relating to our current real asset and other investment vehicles reported in our Real Assets business line for which we have the ability to earn carried interest.

Our Real Asset strategies also typically have a portfolio management team that works with our investment professionals from the date on which an investment is made until the time it is exited in order to ensure that strategic and operational objectives are accomplished and that the performance of the investment is closely monitored. In addition to leveraging the resources of the firm, our infrastructure, real estate, and energy investment teams typically partner with technical experts and operators to manage our Real Asset investments.\nReal Asset Fund Structures\nOur traditional infrastructure and real estate funds generally have investment periods of up to 6 years and generally have a fund term of up to 13 years. Management fees for such funds generally range from 0.75% to 1.5% on committed capital, invested capital, or net asset value during the investment period and on invested capital or net asset value for investments thereafter, subject to certain adjustments. These funds generally have performance hurdles of 8% to 10% subject to a catch-up allocation to the general partner after the hurdle has been reached. Thereafter, the general partners of such funds generally share in 10% to 20% of net profits realized by limited partners.\nOur core real estate and infrastructure funds are open-ended and do not have a fixed termination date. They also do not have a specified termination date for making investments. Management fees for such funds generally range from 0.5% to 1.2% of net asset value, subject to certain adjustments. The general partners of such funds are also entitled to incentive fees ranging generally from 5% to 10% of cash flow or net asset value appreciation, subject to performance hurdles. We also provide investment management services to the publicly available entities in our real assets strategy, including KREF, KREST, and Crescent. These services are pursuant to a management agreement with specific KKR subsidiaries, which provide for the payment of management fees, generally ranging from 1.25% to 1.50% of their equity value or similar metric, as well as incentive fees.\nPrivate Equity and Real Asset Historical Performance\nWe take a long-term approach to Private Equity and Real Assets investing and measure the success of our investments over a period of years rather than months. Given the duration of these investments, the firm focuses on realized multiples of invested capital and internal rates of return (\"IRRs\") when deploying capital in these transactions. We have approximately doubled the value of capital from our inception in 1976 to December 31, 2024 that has been invested by our Private Equity and Real Assets investment funds, turning $203.4 billion of total invested capital into $381.9 billion of total value over that period. \nFrom our inception in 1976 through December 31, 2024, our Private Equity and Real Assets investment funds with at least 24 months of investment activity generated a cumulative gross IRR of 25.5%, compared to the 12.2% and 9.5% gross IRR achieved by the S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index, respectively, over the same period, despite the cyclical and sometimes challenging environments in which we have operated. The S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index are unmanaged indices and their returns assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect any fees or expenses. Our past performance, however, may not be representative of performance in any period other than the period discussed above and is not a guarantee of future results. For additional information regarding impact of market conditions on the value and performance of our investments, see our \"Risk Factors.\"\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2024, relating to the historical performance of certain of our Private Equity and Real Assets investment vehicles since inception, which we believe illustrates the benefits of our investment approach. This data does not reflect additional capital raised since December 31, 2024, or acquisitions or disposals of investments, changes in investment values, or distributions occurring after that date.

(Guernsey) L.P. (formerly known as KKR Private Equity Investors, L.P.) on October 1, 2009.\n(2)\nWhere commitments are not U.S. dollar-denominated, such amounts have been converted into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate prevailing on December 31, 2024.  \n20\nTable of Contents\n(3)\nThe gross IRR, net IRR and gross multiple of invested capital are calculated for our investment funds that made their first investment at least 24 months prior to December 31, 2024. We therefore have not calculated gross IRRs, net IRRs, and gross multiples of invested capital with respect to these funds. \n(4)\nAn investment is considered realized when it has been disposed of or has otherwise generated disposition proceeds or current income that has been distributed by the relevant fund. \n(5)\nIRRs measure the aggregate annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period. Net IRRs are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses. Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses. \nThe gross multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate value generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the fund. Such amounts do not give effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees or organizational expenses.\nKKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds may utilize third-party financing facilities to provide liquidity to such funds. The above net and gross IRRs are calculated from the time capital contributions are due from fund investors to the time fund investors receive a related distribution from the fund, and the use of such financing facilities generally decreases the amount of time that would otherwise be used to calculate IRRs, which tends to increase IRRs when fair value grows over time and decrease IRRs when fair value decreases over time. KKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds also generally provide in certain circumstances, which vary depending on the relevant fund documents, for a portion of capital returned to investors to be restored to unused commitments as recycled capital. For KKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds that have a preferred return, we take into account recycled capital in the calculation of IRRs and multiples of invested capital because the calculation of the preferred return includes the effect of recycled capital. For KKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds that do not have a preferred return, we do not take recycled capital into account in the calculation of IRRs and multiples of invested capital. The inclusion of recycled capital generally causes invested and realized amounts to be higher and IRRs and multiples of invested capital to be lower than had recycled capital not been included. The inclusion of recycled capital would reduce the composite net IRR of all Included Funds by 0.1% and the composite net IRR of all Legacy Funds by 0.5% and would reduce the composite multiple of invested capital of Included Funds by less than 0.1 and the composite multiple of invested capital of Legacy Funds by 0.4. \nFor more information, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities—Future results of our investments may be different than, and may not achieve the levels of, any of our historical returns.\"\nCredit and Liquid Strategies\nOverview\nThrough our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line, we report our credit and hedge funds platforms on a combined basis. As of December 31, 2024, our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line had $276.2 billion of AUM, comprised of $130.2 billion of assets managed in our leveraged credit strategies, $67.7 billion of assets in asset-based finance, $40.9 billion in direct lending, $7.7 billion of assets managed in our SIG strategy, and $29.7 billion of assets managed through our hedge fund platform, which we refer to as the liquid strategies component of our credit and liquid strategies business. Asset-based finance and direct lending together represent our private credit strategy. We manage $142.3 billion of credit investments for our Global Atlantic insurance companies. Our BDCs have approximately $15.5 billion in assets under management, which is reflected in the AUM of our credit strategies above. We report all of the assets under management of our BDCs in our AUM, but we report only a pro rata portion of the assets under management of our hedge fund partnerships based on our percentage ownership in them.\nCredit\nOur credit platform invests capital in a broad range of corporate debt and collateral-backed investments across asset classes and capital structures. Our credit strategies are primarily managed by KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, which is an SEC-registered investment adviser, KKR Credit Advisors (Ireland) Unlimited Company, which is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”), KKR Credit Advisors (EMEA) LLP, which is regulated by the United Kingdom (\"UK\") Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\"), and KKR Credit Advisors (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., which is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and an SEC-registered investment adviser.  We also jointly own with a third party FS/KKR Advisor, LLC, an  investment adviser registered with the SEC that provides investment advisory services to certain registered investment companies, including FS KKR Capital Corp. (NYSE: FSK), a publicly listed BDC, KKR FS Income Trust, a privately-offered BDC and KKR FS Income Trust Select, a privately-offered BDC.  \nOur hedge funds platform consists of strategic partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers in which KKR owns a minority stake. Our hedge fund partnerships offer a range of alternative investment strategies, including long/short equity, hedge fund-of-funds, and energy credit investments.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur credit business pursues a variety of investment strategies in leveraged credit and alternative credit.\nLeveraged Credit.\n Our leveraged credit strategies seek to primarily invest in assets such as leveraged loans (including revolving credit facilities), CLOs, high yield bonds, and structured credit (including CLOs and asset-backed securities). Within leveraged credit, we manage both single-asset class and multi-asset class pools of capital. Our opportunistic credit strategy seeks to deploy capital across investment themes that seek to take advantage of credit market dislocations and relative value opportunities spanning, asset types and liquidity profiles. Our multi-asset credit strategy seeks to dynamically allocate across public liquid credit asset types in a broadly diversified strategy.\nAlternative Credit.\n  Our alternative credit strategy consists of our (i) private credit strategies and (ii) investments overseen by our credit platform’s strategic investments group (“SIG”):\n•\nPrivate Credit.\n Our private credit strategies focus on privately or directly originated and negotiated transactions. These strategies include direct lending typically in the senior part of a company’s capital structure, junior mezzanine debt, and asset-based finance. Through our direct lending strategy, we seek to make investments in primarily senior debt financings for middle-market companies. Through our junior mezzanine debt strategy, investments typically consist of subordinated debt, which generates a current yield, coupled with marginal equity exposure for additional upside potential. Our asset-based finance strategy focuses on multi-sector investments secured by portfolios of financial assets, including loans backed by hard assets across the risk-return spectrum. We also own 19 captive origination platforms that are dedicated to sourcing and structuring asset-based financial assets, hard assets, and contractual cash flows.\n•\nStrategic Investments Group.\n This strategy seeks to provide strategic capital solutions to high quality, mid-to-large cap companies and assets. The strategy pursues investment capital solutions in corporate credit where we believe market volatility or other investment themes have created the opportunity to invest opportunistically across the capital structure and through market cycles to generate outsized returns, and which may include investment terms intended to offer various levels of downside-protection. These investment opportunities may include debt (senior and junior), preferred equity, convertible debt, and structured equity. These investments may include non-control-oriented opportunities, a variety of capital solutions for third-party investment vehicles, balance sheet optimization capital solutions, strategic partner capital, and other event-driven investments in debt or equity.\nHedge Fund Platform\nOur hedge fund platform consists of strategic partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers in which KKR owns a minority stake. This principally consists of a 39.6% interest in Marshall Wace LLP (together with its affiliates, \"Marshall Wace\"), a global alternative investment manager specializing in long/short equity products.  \n22\nTable of Contents\nCredit and Liquid Strategies Assets Under Management and Select Fund Performance Information\nThe following chart presents the growth in the AUM of our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line from December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2024.\nCredit and Liquid Strategies\nAssets Under Management \n(1) \n($ in billions)\n(1)\nAUM of acquired businesses and pro rata AUM of hedge fund partnerships in which KKR has made an investment are included in the years on and after the completion of the respective acquisitions or transactions, as applicable. \n23\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2024, relating to our current credit investment vehicles reported in our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line for which we have the ability to earn carried interest.

The S&P/LSTA Loan Index is a daily tradable index for the U.S. loan market that seeks to mirror the market-weighted performance of the largest institutional loans that meet certain criteria. The BoAML HY Master II Index is an index for high-yield corporate bonds. It is designed to measure the broad high-yield market, including lower-rated securities. The CS Inst West European Leveraged Loan Index contains only institutional loan facilities priced above 90, excluding TL and TLa facilities and loans rated CC, C or are in default. The S&P European Leveraged Loan Index reflects the market-weighted performance of institutional leveraged loan portfolios investing in European credits. While the returns of our leveraged credit strategies reflect the reinvestment of income and dividends, none of the indices presented in the chart above reflect such reinvestment, which has the effect of increasing the reported relative performance of these strategies as compared to the indices. Furthermore, these indices are not subject to management fees, incentive allocations, or expenses.\n(2)\nPerformance is based on a blended composite of Bank Loans, High Yield, and Structured Credit strategy accounts. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Multi-Asset Credit Composite strategy is based on 65% S&P/LSTA Loan Index and 35% BoAML HY Master II Index to May 2022, and 50% S&P/LSTA Loan Index, 50% BoAML HY Master II Index, from June 2022.\n(3)\nThe Opportunistic Credit strategy invests in high-yield securities and corporate loans with no preset allocation. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Opportunistic Credit strategy presented herein is based on 50% S&P/LSTA Loan Index and 50% BoAML HY Master II Index. Funds within this strategy may utilize third-party financing facilities to enhance investment returns. In cases where financing facilities are used, the amounts drawn on the facility are deducted from the assets of the fund in the calculation of net asset value, which tends to increase returns when net asset value grows over time and decrease returns when net asset value decreases over time.\n(4)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in leveraged loans. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Bank Loans strategy is based on the S&P/LSTA Loan Index.\n(5)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in high-yield securities. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the High Yield strategy is based on the BoAML HY Master II Index.\n(6)\nThe returns presented are calculated based on local currency. \n(7)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in higher quality leveraged loans. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the European Leveraged Loans strategy is based on the CS Inst West European Leveraged Loan Index.\n(8)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in European institutional leveraged loans. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the European Credit Opportunities strategy is based on the S&P European Leveraged Loans (All Loans) Index. \n25\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents information regarding our alternative credit investment funds where investors have capital commitments from inception to December 31, 2024.

The use of such financing facilities generally decreases the amount of invested capital that would otherwise be used to calculate IRRs, which tends to increase IRRs when fair value grows over time and decrease IRRs when fair value decreases over time. IRRs measure the aggregate annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period and are calculated taking into account recycled capital. Net IRRs presented are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses.  Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to the allocation of carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses.\n(3)\nThe multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate value generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the investors. The use of financing facilities generally decreases the amount of invested capital that would otherwise be used to calculate multiples of invested capital, which tends to increase multiples when fair value grows over time and decrease multiples when fair value decreases over time. Such amounts do not give effect to the allocation of any realized and unrealized returns on a fund's investments to the fund's general partner pursuant to a carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees and are calculated without taking into account recycled capital. \nFor additional information regarding impact of market conditions on the value and performance of our investments, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Difficult market and economic conditions can, and periodically do, materially adversely affect KKR\" and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities—Future results of our investments may be different than, and may not achieve the levels of, any of our historical returns.\"\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2024, based on the investment funds or other investment vehicles or accounts offered by our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line.

We report all of the assets under management of these BDCs in our AUM and FPAUM.\nCredit and Liquid Strategies Investment Process and Fund Characteristics\nInvestment Approach\nOur approach to making credit investments focuses on creating investment portfolios that seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by selecting investments that may be made at attractive prices, subjecting investments to regular monitoring and oversight, and, for more liquid investments, making buy and sell decisions based on relative value parameters. The firm employs both \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" analyses when making investments. Our top-down analysis involves, as appropriate, a macro analysis of relative asset valuations, long-term industry trends, business cycles, regulatory trends, interest rate expectations, credit fundamentals and technical factors to target specific industry sectors, and asset classes in which to invest. From a bottom-up perspective, our investment decision is predicated on an investment thesis that is developed using our proprietary resources and knowledge and due diligence.\nSourcing and Selecting Investments\nWe source our credit investment opportunities through a variety of channels, including internal deal generation strategies and the firm's global network of contacts at major companies, corporate executives, commercial and investment banks, financial intermediaries, other private equity sponsors, and other investment and advisory institutions. We are also provided with opportunities to invest, in certain strategies where appropriate, in the securities of KKR's private equity portfolio companies, though there are limitations across the platform on the availability and maximum size of such KKR-affiliated investments.\n27\nTable of Contents\nDue Diligence and the Investment Decision\nOnce a potential credit investment has been identified, our investment professionals screen the opportunity and make a preliminary determination concerning whether we should proceed with further diligence. When evaluating the suitability of an investment for our credit investment vehicles, we typically employ a relative value framework and subject the investment to due diligence. This review considers many factors including, as appropriate, expected returns, capital structure, credit ratings, historical and projected financial data, the issuer's competitive position, the quality and track record of the issuer's management team, margin stability, and industry and company trends. Investment professionals use the services of outside advisors and industry experts as appropriate to assist them in the due diligence process and, when relevant and permitted, leverage the knowledge and experience of our Private Equity and Real Assets investment professionals. Strategy-specific investment committees monitor our due diligence practices.\nMonitoring Investments\nWe monitor our portfolios of investments using, as applicable, daily, quarterly, and annual analyses. Daily analyses include morning market meetings, industry and company pricing runs, industry and company reports, and discussions with the firm's Private Equity, Real Assets and Capital Markets investment professionals on an as-needed basis. Quarterly analyses include the preparation of quarterly operating results, reconciliations of actual results to projections, and updates to financial models (baseline and stress cases). Annual analyses involve conducting internal audits and testing compliance with monitoring and documentation requirements.\nCredit Investment Vehicles and Fund Structures\nWe pursue leveraged credit and alternative credit investments across a range of investment vehicles, including investment funds and separately managed accounts, for which we receive a fee and in certain cases an incentive fee or carried interest.\nWe also manage structured credit investment vehicles in the form of CLOs that hold leveraged loans, high-yield bonds or a combination of both. CLOs are typically structured as special purpose investment vehicles that acquire, monitor and, to varying degrees, manage a pool of credit assets. CLOs generally serve as long-term financing for leveraged credit investments and as a way to reduce refinancing risk, reduce maturity risk and secure a fixed cost of funds over an underlying market interest rate. We typically receive a fee for managing CLOs.\nWe also serve as the investment adviser to investment companies registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \"Investment Company Act,\" and such registered investment companies, \"RICs\"), including KKR Income Opportunities Fund (NYSE: KIO), KKR Credit Opportunities Portfolio (an interval fund), as well as FS KKR Capital Corp. (NYSE: FSK), KKR FS Income Trust (a privately offered BDC), and KKR FS Income Trust Select (a privately offered BDC)  through our joint ownership of their investment adviser. We also serve as the investment adviser to other investment vehicles that are available to public investors, including KKR Credit Income Fund (an Australian listed investment trust; ASX: KKC).  The management fees we are paid for managing RICs are generally subject to contractual rights that require their board of directors to provide prior notice in order to terminate our investment management services\n. \n28\nTable of Contents\nCapital Markets\nOur Capital Markets business line is comprised of our global capital markets business, which is integrated with KKR’s asset management business line, and serves our firm, including our insurance business, our portfolio companies, and third-party customers by developing and implementing both traditional and non-traditional capital solutions for investments or companies seeking financing. These services include arranging debt and equity financing, placing and underwriting securities offerings, and providing other types of capital markets services that result in the firm receiving fees, including underwriting, placement, transaction and syndication fees, commissions, underwriting discounts, interest payments and other compensation, which may be payable in cash or securities, in respect of the activities described above. Third-party clients of our capital markets business include multi-national corporations, public and private companies, financial sponsors, mutual funds, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and hedge funds globally. Our capital markets business provides these clients with differentiated access to capital through our distribution platform.\nOur capital markets business underwrites credit facilities and arranges loan syndications and participations. When we are sole or lead arrangers of a credit facility, we may advance amounts to the borrower on behalf of other lenders, subject to repayment. When we underwrite an offering of securities on a firm commitment basis, we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities and generate revenue by purchasing the securities at a discount or for a fee. When we act in an agency capacity or best efforts basis, we generate revenue for arranging financing or placing securities with capital markets investors. We may also provide issuers with capital markets advice on capital structuring, access to markets, marketing considerations, securities pricing, and other aspects of capital markets transactions in exchange for a fee. Our capital markets business also provides syndication services in respect of co-investments in transactions participated in by KKR, our funds, Global Atlantic, and third-party clients, which may entitle the firm to receive syndication fees, management fees, and/or a carried interest.\nThe capital markets business has a global footprint, with local presence and licenses to carry out certain broker-dealer activities in various countries in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. Our flagship capital markets subsidiaries include KKR Capital Markets LLC, which is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a member of FINRA, KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, KKR Capital Markets Partners LLP, which is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, KKR Capital Markets Japan Limited, a Type I and Type II Financial Instruments Business Operator (broker dealer) under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan, KKR Capital Markets Asia Limited, a Hong Kong licensed asset manager and broker-dealer licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong to carry on dealing in securities, advising on securities and asset management regulated activities, and KKR Capital Markets Asia II Limited, a Hong Kong licensed broker-dealer licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong to carry on dealing in securities and advising on securities. \nPrincipal Activities\nThrough our Principal Activities business line, we manage the firm’s own assets on our firm’s balance sheet and deploy capital to support and grow our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines. \nTypically, the funds in our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines contractually require us, as general partner of the funds, to make sizable capital commitments. We believe making general partner commitments assists us in raising new funds from limited partners by demonstrating our conviction in a given fund’s strategy. Our commitments to fund capital also occurs where we are the holder of the subordinated notes or the equity tranche of investment vehicles that we sponsor, including structured transactions. We also use our balance sheet to bridge investment activity during fundraising and, for example, by funding investments for new funds. We also use our own capital to bridge capital selectively for our funds’ investments or finance strategic transactions, although the financial results of an acquired business may be reported in our other business lines.\nOur Principal Activities business line also provides the required capital to fund the various commitments of our Capital Markets business line when underwriting or syndicating securities, or when providing term loan commitments for transactions involving our portfolio companies and for third parties. Our Principal Activities business line also holds assets that are utilized to satisfy regulatory requirements for our Capital Markets business line and risk retention requirements for certain investment vehicles.\nWe also make opportunistic investments through our Principal Activities business line, which include co-investments alongside our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies funds, as well as Principal Activities investments that do not involve our Private Equity, Real Assets, or Credit and Liquid Strategies funds.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe endeavor to use our balance sheet strategically and opportunistically to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on equity in a manner that is consistent with our fiduciary duties, in compliance with applicable laws, and consistent with our one-firm approach.\nPrior to the creation of the Strategic Holdings segment, effective January 2, 2024, the periodic financial operating results of the firm's participation in the core private equity strategy were reported as part of this Principal Activities business line within the Asset Management segment.  Starting with the first quarter of 2024 , those financial operating results are not reflected in the Asset Management segment. See \"Strategic Holdings\" for further information regarding our participation in the core private equity strategy. \nThe chart below presents the holdings of our Principal Activities business line by asset class as of December 31, 2024, excluding our ownership of businesses reported through our Strategic Holdings segment.  \nHoldings by Asset Class \n(1)\n(1)\nGeneral partner commitments to our funds are included in the various asset classes shown above. Assets and revenues of other asset managers with which KKR has formed strategic partnerships where KKR does not hold more than 50% ownership interest are not included in our Principal Activities business line but are reported in the financial results of our other business lines. \n30\nTable of Contents\nFundraising\nWe have dedicated employees on our KKR Global Client Solutions team who are responsible for raising capital for our asset management business globally across products, expanding our investment advisory relationships across asset classes and across types of investors in our investment vehicles, developing products to meet our investors' needs, and servicing our investors and products. We also provide customized solutions for our investors seeking diversified portfolios of investment funds and direct co-investments in privately negotiated investments. \nAs of December 31, 2024 we had over 2,200 investors and platforms who invest in and support our investment vehicles, in addition to a significant underlying individual investor base across asset classes. Our institutional investor base in our investment vehicles is diversified by type, including public and corporate pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, and investment managers. Our private wealth capital comes from multiple sources, including directly from family offices, through our K-Series vehicles and, in the future, via our announced strategic partnership with Capital Group. Our institutional and private wealth capital is sourced from investors spanning over 65 countries.\nThe K-Series suite of vehicles for individual private wealth investors are distributed to the qualified investors of private banks, broker dealers, and independent investment advisors or through third-party managed vehicles sponsored by distributors or third-party feeder providers. Unlike our traditional fund structures, these investments do not have fixed termination dates and provide certain limited opportunities for liquidity. We have K-Series vehicles that operate or invest in private equity companies, infrastructure assets, credit investments, and real estate. We provide our services pursuant to management agreements with these vehicles. Such K-Series' investment vehicles' governing documents provide for management fees, fee related performance fees, and carried interest. As of December 31, 2024, total K-Series AUM was $16.4 billion.\n31\nTable of Contents\nInsurance\nOur insurance business is operated by Global Atlantic, which operates as a separate business with its existing brands and management team. KKR acquired a majority controlling interest in Global Atlantic on February 1, 2021, and the remainder of Global Atlantic on January 2, 2024. Since the first quarter of 2021, we have presented Global Atlantic's financial results as a separate reportable segment.\nGlobal Atlantic is a leading retirement and life insurance company that provides a broad suite of protection, legacy, and savings products to customers and reinsurance solutions to clients across individual and institutional markets. Global Atlantic focuses on target markets that it believes support issuing products that have attractive risk and return characteristics. These markets allow Global Atlantic to leverage its strength in distribution and to deploy shareholder capital opportunistically across various market environments. \nGlobal Atlantic offers individual customers fixed-rate annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, and preneed life insurance products primarily through a network of banks, broker-dealers, and independent marketing organizations. Global Atlantic provides its institutional clients customized reinsurance solutions, including block, flow, and pension risk transfer (\"PRT\") transactions, as well as funding agreements. Global Atlantic’s assets generally increase when individual market sales and reinsurance transactions exceed run-off of in-force policies. Global Atlantic primarily generates income by earning a spread on assets under management, as the difference between its net investment income and the cost of policyholder benefits. Global Atlantic also earns fees paid by policyholders on certain types of contracts and fees paid by third-party investors, which are reported in the asset management segment. As of December 31, 2024, Global Atlantic served over three and a half million policyholders. \nGlobal Atlantic operates in the following two complementary markets: individual and institutional.\nIndividual Markets.\n Global Atlantic seeks to reach individuals in the United States who are planning for, or are already in, retirement. Global Atlantic’s annuity products are distributed primarily through a network of distribution partners, including over 200 banks and broker-dealers and over 200 independent marketing organizations. Global Atlantic generated $15.4 billion of sales from retirement and preneed products for the year ended December 31, 2024. Global Atlantic's preneed life insurance products are distributed primarily through approximately 2,400 funeral homes. \n•\nFixed-Rate and Fixed-Indexed Annuities.\n With an annuity product, the policyholder provides Global Atlantic cash, referred to as a premium, in exchange for earning interest on a tax deferred basis and the ability based on the contract terms to take lump sum or periodic withdrawals of their account value. Global Atlantic’s annuity products typically also offer a death benefit that guarantees the full account value for the beneficiaries in the event of the death of the policyholder. Fixed-rate annuities offer policyholders tax-deferred savings accumulation and income based on a fixed rate that may be guaranteed for a period of time. Fixed-indexed annuities allow the policyholder to elect strategies where interest is credited based on the performance of a market index. This selection allows the policyholder to participate in the upside performance of the selected index, subject to limits and protection from downside market risks. Global Atlantic primarily generates income from annuity products by earning a spread between net investment income and the cost of providing benefits under the annuity contract.\n•\nLife Products.\n Global Atlantic’s targeted product in this category is preneed life insurance. For preneed products, the policyholder generally purchases the preneed product along with a contract with a funeral home that guarantees the policyholder a pre-planned funeral, funded by proceeds from the preneed policy. Global Atlantic primarily generates income from life products from premiums, fees, and investment income, net of the cost of policyholder benefits. Global Atlantic does not underwrite new indexed universal life products, but previously underwritten indexed universal life policies remain in-force.\n \n32\nTable of Contents\nInstitutional Markets.\n Global Atlantic provides its institutional clients customized reinsurance solutions to assist them in meeting their strategic, risk management, and capital goals. In general, by reinsuring policies, the institutional client reduces or releases capital that it held for the reinsured business and may use such capital for its other business goals. Global Atlantic's institutional solutions include block, flow, PRT, and funding agreements. Global Atlantic’s reinsurance solutions are offered through a client coverage effort focused on domestic and international retirement and life companies. Since Global Atlantic’s founding, it has closed multiple reinsurance transactions, including block, flow, and PRT, with 32 clients representing a total of $162.6 billion of assets as of December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Global Atlantic generated $11.9 billion and $1.0 billion of flow and PRT reinsurance production, respectively. To further scale its institutional markets business, Global Atlantic sponsors co-investment vehicles (the \"Ivy and other co-investment vehicles\") to participate alongside Global Atlantic in certain qualifying reinsurance transactions. Global Atlantic also participates in the funding agreement market, including through membership in Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and as a provider of funding agreements in connection with a funding agreement backed notes (\"FABN\") program established in 2021. Global Atlantic primarily generates income from the Institutional Markets channel by earning a spread between net investment income earned on the net assets assumed and the cost of providing benefits to policyholders.\n•\nBlock Reinsurance.\n Block reinsurance is a transaction in which an insurance company divests a block of insurance policies to Global Atlantic in exchange for Global Atlantic’s obligation to pay a specified portion of future insurance claims arising from that block. Global Atlantic operates in the block reinsurance market by offering solutions to its clients across various sizes of transactions and across multiple product types, including both retirement and life products. In block reinsurance transactions, Global Atlantic’s insurance company subsidiaries assume the obligation to pay the policy benefits from the cedant in exchange for a transfer of assets.\n•\nFlow Reinsurance.\n Flow reinsurance is an agreement in which an insurance company writes new retail policies and shares an economic portion of such newly issued policies with an insurance company subsidiary of Global Atlantic, as its reinsurer, on an ongoing basis. Global Atlantic operates in flow reinsurance by partnering with insurance companies that sell retirement products, such as multi-year guaranteed annuities or single premium immediate annuities. Global Atlantic seeks to ensure that its partnerships generate profitable growth, repricing flow reinsurance products as market conditions evolve.\n•\nPRT Transactions.\n PRT is a transaction in which a pension plan sponsor, such as a corporation, transfers the risk associated with the pension plan’s liabilities to an insurance company. Global Atlantic directly underwrites PRT transactions and also operates in the PRT market indirectly through reinsurance relationships with insurance company clients that directly underwrite and assume corporate pension liabilities. Insurance company subsidiaries of Global Atlantic act as the reinsurer in respect of these indirect PRT transactions, and Global Atlantic’s clients are the ceding companies. Global Atlantic’s clients seek PRT transactions to manage risk and to reduce capital requirements. \n•\nFunding Agreements.\n Funding agreements, including those issued in connection with a FABN program, are a deposit-type contract issued by Global Atlantic’s insurance company subsidiaries. In general, a funding agreement provides its holder with a guaranteed return of principal and periodic interest payments. As of December 31, 2024, Global Atlantic had $5.3 billion of funding agreements outstanding under the FABN program.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents Global Atlantic’s new business volumes by business and product for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n($ in millions)\nIndividual Channel:\nFixed-Rate Annuities\n$\n7,777 \n$\n7,509 \nFixed-Indexed Annuities\n7,025 \n3,606 \nVariable Annuities\n19 \n23 \nTotal Retirement Products\n(1)\n$\n14,821\n \n$\n11,138\n \nLife Insurance Products\n(2)\n$\n— \n$\n9 \nPreneed Life\n$\n605 \n$\n299 \nInstitutional Channel:\nBlock\n$\n11,881 \n$\n10,854 \nFlow\n11,865 \n9,787 \nPension Risk Transfer\n996 \n1,471 \nFunding Agreements\n(3)\n2,373 \n510 \nTotal Institutional Channel\n(4)(5)\n$\n27,115\n \n$\n22,622\n \n(1)\nNew business volumes in individual markets are referred to as sales. In Global Atlantic's individual market channel, sales of annuities include all money paid into new and existing contracts. Individual market channel sales of life insurance products are based on commissionable premium and individual market channel sales for preneed life are based on the face amount of insurance. Life insurance product sales do not include the recurring premiums that policyholders may pay over time. \n(2)\nEffective July 1, 2023, Global Atlantic no longer underwrites new indexed universal life products. Indexed universal life policies written prior to this date remain effective.\n(3)\nFunding agreements new business volumes represent funding agreements issued in connection with the FABN and FHLB funding agreements programs.\n(4)\nBlock reinsurance transactions may be episodic and volumes may fluctuate. Similarly, funding agreements issued in the FABN program are subject to capital markets conditions and volumes may fluctuate. Flow and pension risk transfer new business volumes typically occur throughout the year. See “—Risks Related to Our Business—Many parts of our earnings and cash flow are highly variable due to the nature of our business.”\n(5)\nNew business volumes from Global Atlantic’s institutional market channel are based on the assets assumed, net of any ceding commission, and are gross of any retrocessions to investment vehicles that participate in qualifying reinsurance transactions sourced by Global Atlantic and to other third party reinsurers.\nGlobal Atlantic seeks to have a diversified set of policy liabilities in order to manage adverse developments across liability types. As of December 31, 2024, 41% of its reserves were in its individual markets and 59% were in its institutional markets.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe table below represents a breakdown of Global Atlantic’s policy liabilities by business and product type as of December 31, 2024, separated by reserves originated through its individual and institutional markets.\nReserves as of December 31, 2024\nIndividual Market\nInstitutional Market\n(4)\nTotal\nCeded\nTotal, net\nPercentage of Total\n($ in thousands, except percentages, if applicable)\nFixed-Rate Annuities\n(1)\n$\n28,585,274 \n$\n36,642,286 \n$\n65,227,560 \n$\n(10,306,503)\n$\n54,921,057 \n34.5 \n%\nFixed-Indexed Annuities\n(1)\n28,985,285 \n11,107,669 \n40,092,954 \n(4,461,289)\n35,631,665 \n21.2 \n%\nPayout Annuities\n(1)\n568,014 \n22,248,618 \n22,816,632 \n(11,765,332)\n11,051,300 \n12.1 \n%\nVariable Annuities\n2,251,687 \n5,396,401 \n7,648,088 \n(2,141,907)\n5,506,181 \n4.0 \n%\nInterest Sensitive Life\n(1)\n13,721,883 \n18,996,534 \n32,718,417 \n(8,957,109)\n23,761,308 \n17.3 \n%\nOther Life Insurance\n(2)\n3,723,878 \n4,137,697 \n7,861,575 \n(2,898,149)\n4,963,426 \n4.2 \n%\nFunding Agreements\n(3)\n— \n7,158,103 \n7,158,103 \n— \n7,158,103 \n3.8 \n%\nClosed Block and Other Corporate Products\n— \n1,035,059 \n1,035,059 \n(974,331)\n60,728 \n0.5 \n%\nOther\n(5)\n— \n4,628,038 \n4,628,038 \n(3,645,319)\n982,719 \n2.4 \n%\nTotal Reserves\n$\n77,836,021\n \n$\n111,350,405\n \n$\n189,186,426\n \n$\n(45,149,939)\n$\n144,036,487\n \n100.0\n \n%\nTotal General Account\n$\n75,833,868 \n$\n109,371,498 \n$\n185,205,366 \n$\n(45,149,939)\n$\n140,055,427 \n97.9 \n%\nTotal Separate Account\n2,002,153 \n1,978,907 \n3,981,060 \n— \n3,981,060 \n2.1 \n%\nTotal Reserves\n$\n77,836,021\n \n$\n111,350,405\n \n$\n189,186,426\n \n$\n(45,149,939)\n$\n144,036,487\n \n100.0\n \n%\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024, 82% of the account value in Global Atlantic's general account associated with its fixed-rate and fixed-indexed annuity products, and 42% of account value in its general account associated with universal life products, was protected by surrender charges.\n(2)\n\"Other life products” includes universal life, term, and whole life insurance products.\n(3)\n\"Funding agreements” includes funding agreements associated with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and under Global Atlantic's funding-agreement backed-notes program.\n(4)\nInstitutional market reserves are sourced using customized reinsurance solutions such as block, flow, and PRT. As of December 31, 2024, reserves sourced through block, flow, and PRT transactions were $63.3 billion, $31.6 billion, and $6.2 billion, respectively.\n(5)\n“Other” includes long-term care insurance where Global Atlantic has ceded mortality and morbidity risk to a third-party reinsurance company.\nUnderwriting and Pricing\nGlobal Atlantic’s underwriting and pricing functions have dedicated teams, who are supported by multiple corporate functions, including actuarial, finance, operations, compliance, investments, and risk. These functions have guidelines and procedures designed to assess and quantify the risks of each product type originated through its individual or institutional markets.\nGlobal Atlantic’s internal, proprietary technology platform incorporates analytic models with customized third-party software and database technology, allowing Global Atlantic to dynamically analyze its asset and liability cash flow profile across a range of market and policyholder behavior scenarios. This proprietary platform allows Global Atlantic to integrate investment allocation decisions with product pricing, so that the terms of the liabilities it originates reflect its view of the investment environment. The committees responsible for underwriting and pricing are also aligned with other business functions and include representatives from actuarial, finance, operations, investments, risk, and sales.\nGlobal Atlantic also performs suitability reviews for new annuity sales. For sales through banks and broker-dealers, Global Atlantic generally delegates suitability reviews to these distribution partners.\nWhen pricing reinsurance transactions in the institutional market, Global Atlantic performs asset and liability modeling of the block of business to be reinsured and typically re-underwrites the liability assumptions on the block using then-current market conditions, actuarial experience provided by the ceding company, and its own experience from business Global Atlantic has originated. Reinsured blocks of business are integrated into Global Atlantic’s technology and infrastructure systems and monitored in the same manner used across the broader business, combining input from actuarial, risk, investment management, and other functions.\n35\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Management\nGlobal Atlantic has an excellent track record of generating strong investment results, and since February 2021, KKR has been the investment manager of Global Atlantic’s assets. Global Atlantic believes that KKR's investment expertise, broad range of investment management services, and strong origination capabilities are key to maintaining Global Atlantic's successful track record of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns. Global Atlantic’s investment management strategy seeks to procure assets that are well-suited to the stable and long-dated nature of Global Atlantic's insurance liabilities.\nGlobal Atlantic seeks to focus on investments that have the potential to generate stable, predictable, long-dated asset cash flows, are of high credit quality, and that focus on capital protection. These kinds of investments have historically consisted of corporate debt, asset-backed finance, specialty finance, transportation finance, securitizations, private loan facilities, and commercial and residential real estate investment opportunities, amongst other asset classes. However, Global Atlantic’s investments are not limited to solely those asset classes.\nSupplementing KKR’s role as an investment advisor, Global Atlantic has retained in-house certain investment origination and allocation functions with expertise in consideration of insurance company asset portfolios. These considerations include asset-liability matching, asset allocation, ongoing portfolio management, and new business pricing across both Global Atlantic’s individual and institutional markets. Global Atlantic believes that matching asset and liability cash flows is key to protecting policyholders and achieving its target returns. Global Atlantic’s investment origination and allocation functions are closely integrated with its risk management team, and a group of its risk management professionals is dedicated to supporting investment decision-making. Global Atlantic uses a proprietary risk platform to develop a comprehensive view of the expected cash flow profile of its liabilities and determine the optimal profile of its asset cash flows. Global Atlantic is also capable of developing a bottoms-up view of the cash flows of investments that it considers. These processes help to identify the investments that offer a cash flow profile that is consistent with Global Atlantic’s risk tolerances.\nWorking within Global Atlantic’s cash flow matching framework as well as its regulatory and rating agency requirements, Global Atlantic has a flexible investment mandate, which allows it to pursue asset classes and investment types that it believes offer the best risk-adjusted returns. Global Atlantic believes that the integration of the analytics around its assets and liabilities and its flexible investment mandate enable Global Atlantic to respond dynamically to market conditions and make investment decisions that maximize risk adjusted returns while still protecting Global Atlantic’s policyholders.\nFor additional information regarding Global Atlantic's investment portfolio, see Note 7 \"Investments\" in our financial statements and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Segment Balance Sheet Investments—Global Atlantic's Investment Portfolio\".\nCapital\nCapital strength allows insurance companies to meet their future policyholder obligations and to support the growth of their businesses. Global Atlantic believes it has built a strong financial foundation to meet these objectives. Global Atlantic is well capitalized, and its capital position, combined with annual capital generation from its seasoned in-force book of business and third-party capital, helps it to fund new business volume growth. Global Atlantic takes a responsible and flexible capital approach to allocating capital to where it believes is the most attractive alternative available. Global Atlantic manages its capital and liquidity position with the objective of maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity to be able to capture investment opportunities as they arise and meet policyholder obligations, even in times of foreseeable stress. \nThe financial strength of Global Atlantic’s life insurance operating subsidiaries is recognized by several ratings agencies. The financial strength ratings of these subsidiaries are “A” with a stable outlook from A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), “A2” with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), “A-” with a positive outlook from S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”), and “A” with a stable outlook from Fitch Ratings, Inc. (\"Fitch\").\nGlobal Atlantic also sponsors third-party co-investment vehicles to participate alongside Global Atlantic in qualifying reinsurance opportunities. These sponsored reinsurance vehicles provide third-party capital to support reinsurance transactions. As of December 31, 2024, third parties have committed capital to the sponsored reinsurance vehicles of approximately $5.5 billion, of which $3.1 billion has been deployed. \n36\nTable of Contents\nStrategic Holdings\nStarting with the first quarter of 2024, we report a third segment named Strategic Holdings. Our Strategic Holdings segment is currently comprised of the firm’s ownership in the businesses we acquired through our participation in our core private equity strategy. In our core private equity strategy, our objective is to acquire and manage controlling interests in operating companies, which we intend to hold over a longer period of time and that we believe have a lower anticipated risk profile than our investments in businesses acquired through our traditional private equity strategy. Our core private equity portfolio companies are generally expected to be more stable and typically have lower leverage over our holding period than our traditional private equity portfolio companies. We may acquire in the future other long-term assets in our Strategic Holdings segment that are not part of the core private equity strategy, and our Strategic Holdings segment is not limited to specific industry or constrained to any investment strategy that we may manage for our investment funds or vehicles. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our Strategic Holdings segment consisted of our ownership stakes in 18 companies that we acquired through our core private equity strategy. Based on certain information made available to management as of December 31, 2024, approximately 66% of these companies are based in the Americas, 28% in Europe, and 6% in the Asia-Pacific (based on the geographic location of their headquarters). In addition, based on such information, these companies are primarily engaged in the following business sectors: approximately 33% in Business Services, 30% in Consumer, 14% in technology-media-telecommunications (TMT), 13% in Healthcare, and 10% in Infrastructure.  We currently expect our Strategic Holdings segment to generate income from the receipt of dividends from our ownership stakes in these businesses, and if any ownership stake were to be sold, we would recognize realized investment income from such sale.  \nThe fees and carried interest paid by the third party investors in our core private equity funds continues to be reported in our Asset Management segment and are not reported in our Strategic Holdings segment. Our Asset Management segment charges a quarterly management fee based on invested capital in our Strategic Holdings segment. Additionally, our Asset Management segment charges a performance fee from the sale of our interests in the companies included in our Strategic Holdings segment. The management and performance fees are charged in order to represent the cost of providing advisory services by our Asset Management segment rather than determining the allocable costs borne by our Asset Management segment to support our Strategic Holdings segment. \nCompetition\nOur asset management business competes with other investment managers for both investors in our investment vehicles and investment opportunities. The firm's competitors consist primarily of traditional and alternative asset manager sponsors of public and private investment vehicles, real estate development companies, BDCs, investment banks (including activities conducted by their broker-dealers and investment advisers), commercial finance companies, and operating companies acting as strategic buyers. We believe that competition for investors in our investment vehicles is based primarily on investment performance, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, investor perception of investment managers' drive, focus and alignment of interest, business reputation, duration of relationships, quality of services, pricing, fund terms including fees, and the relative attractiveness of the types of investments that have been or are to be made. We believe that competition for investment opportunities is based primarily on the pricing, terms, and structure of a proposed investment and certainty of execution. In addition to these traditional competitors within the global investment management industry, we also face competition from local and regional firms, financial institutions, and sovereign wealth funds in the various countries in which we invest. In certain emerging markets, local firms may have more established relationships with the companies in which we are attempting to invest. These competitors often fall into one of the aforementioned categories but in some cases may represent new types of fund investors, including high net worth individuals, family offices, and state-sponsored entities.  \nThere are numerous funds focused on private equity, real assets, credit, and hedge fund strategies that compete for investor capital. Fund managers have also increasingly adopted investment strategies outside of their traditional focus. For example, traditional asset management firms have acquired alternative asset management firms, and hedge funds focused on credit and equity strategies have taken control positions in companies, while private equity funds have acquired minority equity or debt positions in publicly listed companies. This convergence heighten competition for investments. Furthermore, as institutional fund investors increasingly consolidate their relationships for multiple investment products with a few investment firms, competition for capital from such institutional fund investors may become more acute. However, such consolidation may also lead institutional fund investors to prefer more established investment firms, which could help us to compete against newer entrants or investment firms that are smaller in size or offer more limited types of investment strategies.  We also face extensive competition from both traditional and alternative asset management firms in connection with our business initiatives to increase the number and types of investment products, including our K-Series vehicles, and fundraise directly and indirectly from individual investors, including accredited investors and mass affluent individuals.  \n37\nTable of Contents\nSome of the entities that we compete with as an investment firm may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, and more personnel than us.  In the case of some asset classes and certain investment products, including those offered to individual investors, our competitors may, and sometimes do, have longer operating histories, more established relationships, or greater experience. Several of our competitors also have raised, or may raise, significant amounts of capital and have investment objectives that are similar to the investment objectives of our funds, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have lower costs of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive advantages for them. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider range of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments. Strategic buyers may also be able to achieve synergistic cost savings or revenue enhancements with respect to a targeted portfolio company, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for such investments.\nOur capital markets business competes primarily with investment banks and independent broker-dealers in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. We principally focus our capital markets activities on the firm, our portfolio companies, and fund investors, but we also seek to service other third parties. While we generally target customers with whom we have existing relationships, those customers may have similar relationships with the firm's competitors, many of whom will have access to competing securities transactions, greater financial, technical or marketing resources, or more established reputations than us.\nGlobal Atlantic has always operated in highly competitive markets, but there has been a substantial increase in Global Atlantic's competition in the insurance business as non-traditional firms, including those owned by or with strategic partnerships with alternative asset managers, have entered the insurance sector at a rapid pace. Traditional insurers and reinsurers have also been significantly expanding their areas of expertise and product lines, which could have a significant effect on competition in the insurance industry. These new and traditional competitors may be able to price new business aggressively, with a higher investment risk tolerance, as part of a strategy to gain market share, or increase assets under management.   \nWithin individual markets, Global Atlantic faces a variety of large and small industry participants. Large, established insurers often operate with the benefit of well-known brands, entrenched distribution relationships, or proprietary distribution. All of these companies compete for individual markets sales. Global Atlantic’s flow reinsurance business may also be impacted by competition among insurers in individual markets. The competitiveness of Global Atlantic’s product offerings will depend on the actions of its competitors and Global Atlantic’s ability to actively manage its product offerings. In institutional markets, there have been many block reinsurance transactions as many insurers continue to reevaluate their commitment to business lines and seek reinsurance solutions as a way to de-emphasize or divest non-core businesses, reduce risk, seek capital relief, or improve profitability. The block reinsurance and pension risk transfer markets are also experiencing competition due to new entrants, including entrants which have strategic partnerships with alternative asset managers and entrants based outside of the United States. Increased competition across all of our product offerings may make it more difficult for Global Atlantic to identify and execute transactions with terms that are commercially acceptable based on our risk tolerance and target return objectives. Increased competition may also increase regulatory scrutiny of individual or institutional markets activity.\nCompetition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees and consultants, including those with industry-specific expertise, such as employees and consultants in our insurance business. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new investment professionals, other employees, and consultants and retain and motivate our existing investment professionals, other employees, and consultants. We are also impacted by Global Atlantic's ability to attract and retain insurance professionals in the United States and Bermuda, including wholesalers, actuaries, risk management professionals, and agents.\nFor additional information regarding the level of competition we face, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The investment management and insurance businesses are intensely competitive.\"\nHuman Capital\nWe believe our people and our culture are the keys to our success and what sets our firm apart. We strive to create a workplace environment where employees thrive both professionally and personally. At KKR, our philosophy is to ensure we rigorously and effectively invest in our people throughout their careers. Our key focuses include driving exceptional performance and enhancing our firm's culture of collaboration. \n38\nTable of Contents\nThe primary goal in our human capital management team is to attract, develop, and retain exceptional talent at KKR by providing them with meaningful and well-understood careers. We therefore focus on employee training and professional development. Where appropriate, we offer workshops, mentoring, and executive coaching to supplement on-the-job experiences and ongoing feedback and coaching to maximize performance. In addition, fostering a culture of physical, mental, and emotional health and wellness is a priority for KKR, and we offer tools and resources to our employees so they can make informed health care decisions for themselves and their families. \nIn a people driven business, we believe a breadth of perspectives, skills, and experiences working together collaboratively is the most effective means of producing exceptional results. We pursue this aspiration in a variety of ways including through our different internal committees, strategic external partnerships, and our broader engagement in different communities. We believe this multi-faceted approach gives us the best opportunity to attract, develop, and retain the best possible talent, which we believe is integral to our success.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 4,834 people worldwide\n(1)\n:\nAsset Management\n2,523 \nInsurance\n1,613 \nSubsidiary Organizations\n(2)\n698 \nTotal Employees\n4,834\n \n(1)\nThe employment headcount categories above align with our internal human capital headcount reporting and may diverge in certain respects with respect to our employees who are responsible for generating the financial results within each of our three reporting segments. Certain employees reported in the separate categories above, including our business operations professionals, may also perform certain functions in support of another headcount category.  Our strategic holdings segment is supported by employees within the asset management headcount category.  \n(2)\nIncludes employees from our majority owned and controlled subsidiaries that do not directly engage in KKR's legacy asset management or insurance businesses.\nAsset Management \nOur asset management employees includes our investment professionals, our team of operating professionals at KKR Capstone, and our business operations professionals (some of whom may also support our insurance business). \nOur asset management employees come from diverse professional backgrounds in private equity, real assets, credit, and other asset classes and include employees with operations, strategic consulting, risk management, liability management, and finance experience. As a group, these professionals provide us with a strong global team for identifying attractive investment opportunities, creating value, and generating superior returns. We have developed an institutionalized process for creating value in investments. As part of our effort, we utilize a team of operating professionals at KKR Capstone, who work exclusively with our investment professionals and portfolio company management teams or our designees. With professionals in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, KKR Capstone provides additional expertise for assessing investment opportunities and assisting managers of portfolio companies in defining strategic priorities and implementing operational changes. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 941 investment professionals and KKR Capstone operating professionals. \nOur other asset management employees come from diverse professional backgrounds in capital markets, operations, economics, capital raising, client services, public affairs, finance, tax, legal, compliance, risk management, human capital, marketing and communications, investor relations, and information technology. As a group, these professionals provide us with a strong team for supporting our investment activities and performing capital markets activities, servicing our existing clients, and creating relationships with new clients globally.  \nInsurance\nGlobal Atlantic employs professionals with diverse professional backgrounds in the insurance industry, including individual channel sales, reinsurance, investment origination and allocation, risk management, actuarial and business operations support functions (some of whom may also support our asset management business). Global Atlantic's employees seek to provide attractive products for Global Atlantic's policyholders, solutions for its clients and risk-adjusted returns for us.\n39\nTable of Contents\nResponsible Investment Management \nIn our experience, the thoughtful review and possible management of sustainability, regulatory, and geopolitical issues is an essential part of long-term business success in a rapidly changing world. We believe incorporating such business-relevant issues in our investment process can help us both create and protect value. We seek to invest responsibly by incorporating sustainability, regulatory, and geopolitical considerations into our investment decision-making and investment management practices using an approach that prioritizes business-relevant topics that KKR considers most significant for maximizing and protecting the value of our portfolio companies and assets. Our Responsible Investment Policy, which is publicly available, articulates KKR’s responsible investment framework and approaches that KKR believes are broadly relevant for each asset class.  \n40\nTable of Contents\nOrganizational Structure  \nThe following simplified diagram, which excludes multiple legal entities, illustrates our organizational structure as of February 28, 2025.  \n(1)\nKKR Management LLP, which is owned by senior KKR employees, is the sole holder of Series I preferred stock of KKR & Co. Inc. The Series I preferred stock will be redeemed and cancelled, and KKR & Co. Inc.'s common stock will become vested with all common voting powers on a one vote per share basis, on the \"Sunset Date\" (which will be no later than December 31, 2026 as provided in the Reorganization Agreement); see \"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this report. \n(2)\nCarried interest earned from our investment funds is allocated to KKR Associates Holdings L.P., which we refer to as the carry pool, from which carried interest that is earned from our investment funds is allocable to our employees and other persons.  This entity and the carry pool are not reflected in the organizational structure chart. See  \"Part III—Item 11—Executive Compensation\" and \"Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Asset Management—Expenses—Compensation and Benefits\" in this report for further detail on the percentage of carried interest that is allocable to the carry pool. A wholly-owned subsidiary of KKR & Co. Inc. will become the general partner of KKR Associates Holdings L.P. and thereby acquire control of the carry pool on the \"Sunset Date\" (which will be no later than December 31, 2026 as provided in the Reorganization Agreement; see \"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this report). \n(3)\nIncludes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., the SEC-registered investment adviser, which in turn is the parent company of KKR's other principal investment management and broker-dealer subsidiaries.\n(4)\nIncludes our insurance business operated by Global Atlantic. \n41\nTable of Contents\nRegulation\nOur operations are subject to regulation and supervision in a number of jurisdictions. The level of regulation and supervision to which we are subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved. We, in conjunction with our outside advisors and counsel, seek to manage our business and operations in compliance with such regulation and supervision. The regulatory and legal requirements that apply to our activities are subject to change from time to time and may become more restrictive, which may make compliance with applicable requirements more difficult or expensive or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct our business activities in the manner in which they are now conducted. Changes in applicable regulatory and legal requirements, including changes in their enforcement, could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. As a matter of public policy, the regulatory bodies that regulate our business activities are generally responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities, insurance and financial markets and protecting fund investors and policyholders who participate in those markets rather than protecting the interests of our stockholders. For further information regarding potential risks relating to these and other regulatory and legal requirements that could significantly affect our business, see the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report, including \"—Risks Related to Our Business—Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties, which could materially and adversely affect KKR.\" \nUnited States\nRegulation as an Investment Adviser\nWe conduct our advisory business through our investment adviser subsidiaries, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, KKR Registered Advisor LLC and KKR Credit Advisors (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., each of which is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \"Investment Advisers Act\"). We also jointly own with a third party FS/KKR Advisor, LLC, which is an investment adviser registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. In addition, we own Global Atlantic's investment adviser, Global Atlantic Investment Advisors, LLC, which is another investment adviser registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. The investment advisers are subject to, among other Investment Advisers Act provisions, the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions, which apply to our relationships with our advisory clients globally, including funds that we manage. These provisions and duties impose restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our fund investors and our investments, including for example restrictions on agency cross and principal transactions. Our registered investment advisers are subject to periodic SEC examinations and other requirements under the Investment Advisers Act and related regulations primarily intended to benefit advisory clients. These additional requirements relate, among other things, to maintaining an effective and comprehensive compliance program, record-keeping and reporting requirements and disclosure requirements. The Investment Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements include the prohibition of individuals from associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines.\nKKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, KKR Registered Advisor LLC and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. are also subject to regulation as investment advisers to RICs under the Investment Company Act. RICs advised by our investment advisers include KKR Income Opportunities Fund, KKR Credit Opportunities Portfolio and KREST. The Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder, among other things, regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or restrict principal transactions and joint transactions. FS/KKR Advisor serves as investment adviser to FS KKR Capital Corp., KKR FS Income Trust and KKR FS Income Trust Select, which are subject to regulations applicable to BDCs under the Investment Company Act, including portfolio construction requirements and limitations on transactions with affiliates.

Global Atlantic's distribution of insurance products that are regulated as securities is conducted by Global Atlantic Distributors, LLC, which is also registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC under the Exchange Act and in 52 U.S. states and territories, and is also a member of the FINRA. As registered broker-dealers, KKR Capital Markets, LLC and Global Atlantic Distributors, LLC are subject to periodic SEC and FINRA examinations and reviews. A broker-dealer is subject to legal requirements covering all aspects of its securities business, including sales and trading practices, public and private securities offerings, the suitability of investments, use and safekeeping of customers' funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers, employees, and other associated persons. These requirements include the SEC's \"uniform net capital rule,\" which specifies the minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain, requires a significant part of the broker-dealer's assets to be kept in relatively liquid form, imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing its capital and subjects any distributions or withdrawals of capital by a broker-dealer to notice requirements. These and other requirements also include rules that limit a broker-dealer's ratio of subordinated debt to equity in its regulatory capital composition, constrain a broker-dealer's ability to expand its business under certain circumstances and impose additional requirements when the broker-dealer participates in securities offerings of affiliated entities. Violations of these requirements may result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of the broker-dealer or its officers or employees or other similar consequences by regulatory bodies.\nInsurance Regulation\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision under U.S. federal and state laws. Each U.S. state, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories and possessions have insurance laws that apply to companies licensed to carry on an insurance business in the applicable jurisdiction. The primary regulator of an insurance company, however, is located in the insurance company's state of domicile. Both Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company and First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company are organized and domiciled in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; Accordia Life and Annuity Company (\"Accordia\") is organized and domiciled in the State of Iowa; and Forethought Life Insurance Company is organized and domiciled in the State of Indiana (together, these four companies constitute our \"U.S. insurance subsidiaries\"). Additionally, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact insurance business in, and are subject to regulation and supervision by, all 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,  and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nState insurance authorities have broad administrative powers over each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries with respect to all aspects of the insurance business. Insurance subsidiaries must prepare financial statements on regulatory capital in accordance with statutory financial accounting, must report on their risk management and corporate governance and must receive regulatory approval for certain transactions, including transactions with affiliates. As part of their routine regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records, accounts and operations of insurance companies that are domiciled in their states. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other, non-domiciliary states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the \"NAIC\"). State insurance departments also regularly conduct regulatory inquiries of the insurance companies licensed in their states.\nWe also have special purpose financial captive insurance company subsidiaries domiciled in Vermont and Iowa that provide reinsurance to Accordia in order to facilitate the financing of redundant reserve requirements associated with the application of the NAIC Model Regulation entitled \"Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation\" (\"Regulation XXX\") and NAIC Actuarial Guideline XXXVIII (\"AG38\"). The application of both Regulation XXX and AG38 requires Global Atlantic to maintain statutory reserves which may be in excess of reserves required under GAAP.\nThe rates, policy terms, and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any regulatory authority. However, the ability of a primary insurer to take credit for the reinsurance purchased from reinsurance companies is a significant component of reinsurance regulation. Typically, a primary insurer will only enter into a reinsurance agreement if it can obtain credit against its reserves on its statutory basis financial statements for the reinsurance ceded to the reinsurer.\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. Any proposed dividend in excess of the amount permitted by law is considered an \"extraordinary dividend or distribution\" and may not be paid until it has been approved, or a 30-day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved, by the commissioner of the applicable domiciliary state of the U.S. insurance subsidiary. None of our special purpose financial captive insurance company subsidiaries may declare or pay dividends or distributions in any form to us other than in accordance with its transaction agreements and governing licensing order.\n43\nTable of Contents\nState insurance holding company laws and regulations generally provide that no person, corporation or other entity may acquire control of an insurance company, or a controlling interest in any parent company of an insurance company, without the prior approval of such insurance company's domiciliary state insurance regulator. Under the laws of each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary states, acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered to have acquired control of the insurer, although such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not in fact exist.\nFinally, while the United States federal government in most contexts currently does not directly regulate the insurance business, the Federal Insurance Office (the \"FIO\") established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") now has an oversight role with respect to insurance regulation.\nRegulation Related to Special Servicing  \nOur wholly-owned subsidiary, K-Star Asset Management LLC (\"K-Star\") serves as a special servicer for certain CMBS and CLO transactions in which funds and/or accounts managed by our investment adviser subsidiaries have controlling positions. Its business is subject to state regulations in certain states in which it operates, including regulations requiring K-Star to maintain a special servicer rating from Fitch, S&P Global Ratings, and DB Morningstar, applicable regulations in the states in which such serviced property is located, and other regulations applicable to K-Star's obligations under the relevant servicing agreements.\nIreland\nWe have a number of subsidiaries which are authorized and regulated by the CBI. The CBI is responsible for, among other things, regulating and supervising firms that provide financial services in Ireland, including broker-dealers and investment firms. The CBI also develops and maintains regulatory policies for Ireland's financial services sector. The CBI has the authority to approve applications from financial services providers in Ireland, monitor compliance with its standards, and take enforcement action for non-compliance. Violation of the CBI's requirements may result in administrative sanctions; investigations; refusal, revocation or cancellation of authorization or registrations; criminal prosecution; and/or reports to other agencies. \nKKR Alternative Investment Management Unlimited Company, KKR Credit Advisors (Ireland) Unlimited Company and KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited Company are regulated by the CBI. KKR Alternative Investment Management Unlimited Company is an authorized European Union (\"EU\") alternative investment manager permitted to conduct portfolio management, risk management and certain administrative activities.

KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited also benefits from a passport under the single market directives to offer services cross border into all countries in the European Economic Area.\nIn Europe, we operate in accordance with the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (the “AIFMD”), which establishes a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory framework for alternative investment fund managers (“AIFMs”) that manage or market alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) in the EU. \nUnited Kingdom\nWe have several subsidiaries which are authorized and regulated by the FCA under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\"FSMA\"). FSMA and related rules govern most aspects of investment business, including investment management, sales, research and trading practices, provision of investment advice, corporate finance, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, regulatory capital, record-keeping, margin practices and procedures, approval standards for individuals, anti-money laundering, periodic reporting, and settlement procedures. The FCA is responsible for administering these requirements and our compliance with the FSMA and related rules. Violations of these requirements may result in censures, fines, imposition of additional requirements, injunctions, restitution orders, revocation or modification of permissions or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from certain \"controlled functions\" within the financial services industry of officers or employees performing such functions or other similar consequences.\n44\nTable of Contents\nKKR Capital Markets Partners LLP has permission to engage in a number of regulated activities regulated under FSMA, including dealing as principal or agent and arranging deals in relation to certain types of specified investments and arranging the safeguarding and administration of assets.

The Bermuda Insurance Act grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies and to approve any change or controllers. The Bermuda Insurance Act imposes solvency, capital and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies. The Bermuda Insurance Act prohibits our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year unless certain financial conditions are met or prior approval from the BMA is received. A Bermuda licensed insurer is required to maintain a sufficiently staffed principal office in Bermuda.\nOther Jurisdictions\nCertain other subsidiaries or funds that we advise are registered with, have been licensed by or have obtained authorizations to operate in their respective jurisdictions other than the jurisdictions described above, including Australia, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mauritius, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and United Arab Emirates.

CYBERSECURITY \nCybersecurity Governance\nKKR’s Chief Information Security Officer (the “KKR CISO”) leads an information security team (the “KKR information security team”) whose responsibilities include securing data from unauthorized use or access. The cybersecurity strategy and program at KKR’s asset management business includes, among other things, annual employee training about cybersecurity risks and new employee onboarding about KKR’s security policies.\nPrior to joining KKR, KKR’s CISO was the CISO at another large financial institution where he was responsible for their global information security program.

The Global Atlantic CISO reports at least annually to the operations & technology committee of Global Atlantic’s board of directors (whose members include non-executive directors unaffiliated with KKR) and members of KKR’s Risk and Operations Committee. The Global Atlantic CISO also provides ad hoc reporting to Global Atlantic’s management-level committees and Global Atlantic’s board of directors and its risk committee. Material information regarding information security affecting our insurance business is also reported to KKR’s Risk and Operations Committee and to the Audit Committee or Risk Committee of KKR’s Board of Directors.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nKKR’s asset management business has a cybersecurity incident response plan, which was developed taking into account industry standard guidance provided by institutes such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology. \nThis plan is a key component of the cybersecurity program, which is generally incorporated within our enterprise risk management framework.\n The KKR CISO and KKR’s Chief Compliance Officer co-chair a cybersecurity incident response team (“KKR CIRT”), which aims to manage and mitigate the risk and impact of cybersecurity breach events at KKR’s asset management business, including those arising from third-party service providers, including those providers that have access to KKR’s customer and employee data. Cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of our third-party service providers. We perform cybersecurity-related diligence on third parties that have access to our systems, data or facilities.\nIn addition to the KKR CISO and our Chief Compliance Officer, the KKR CIRT includes members of the firm’s legal, technology, compliance, risk, public affairs, human capital and finance groups. KKR has established a notification decision framework to determine when the KKR CIRT will provide notifications regarding certain cybersecurity incidents, with different severity thresholds triggering notifications to different recipient groups, including the Risk and Operations Committee, senior members of management, and our Board of Directors or its committees. \n128\nTable of Contents\nThe KKR information security team undertakes a variety of measures to monitor and manage the cybersecurity risks of KKR’s asset management business. Our technology platforms and applications are designed to enable us to monitor user and network behavior at KKR’s asset management business, identify threats using certain analytics, and mitigate attacks across various layers of the enterprise. \nThe KKR information security team conducts regular internal and external audits with \nthird-party\n cybersecurity experts to identify and evaluate potential weaknesses in our cybersecurity systems. In addition, the KKR information security team conducts periodic phishing simulations, as well as periodic employee training on KKR’s security policies and controls and provides other security trainings as part of new employee onboarding.\n \nKKR also has a cybersecurity incident response plan that is specific to our insurance business. The plan sets forth the roles and responsibilities of the Global Atlantic incident response team, which is comprised of Global Atlantic employees representing key business functions at our insurance business and is overseen by the Global Atlantic CISO. Global Atlantic utilizes several mechanisms to monitor and manage the cybersecurity risks of our insurance business, including to prevent, and prepare to respond to, an incident.  This includes maintaining relationships with external incident response organizations, performing periodic cybersecurity risk assessments, overseeing and monitoring risks from cybersecurity threats associated with third-party service providers, and ensuring that Global Atlantic employees complete security awareness training relating to cybersecurity best practices. Global Atlantic also has a cybersecurity notification framework in place to determine when appropriate notifications and escalations are required to be provided to senior members of Global Atlantic’s management, members of Global Atlantic’s board of directors and members of KKR’s Risk and Operations Committee, certain members of which would, as appropriate, report such information to our Board of Directors or its Audit Committee or Risk Committee.\nAs of the date of this filing, we do not believe that our business strategy, results of operations or financial conditions have been materially affected by any cybersecurity incidents for the period covered by this report.\n However, institutions like us, as well as our employees, service providers and other third parties, have experienced information security and cybersecurity attacks in the past and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyber actors.
