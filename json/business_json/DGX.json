Business: The Clinical Testing Industry\n.\" \nCritical Accounting Policies \n    \n    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect our reported financial results and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\n    Our revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions, and about one-half of our total costs and expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits.  Due to the nature of our business, several of our accounting policies involve significant estimates and judgments: \n•\nrevenues and accounts receivable associated with DIS; \n•\nreserves for general and professional liability claims; \n•\nreserves for other legal proceedings; and\n•\naccounting for and recoverability of goodwill.\n    Revenues and accounts receivable associated with DIS\n    The process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of receivables associated with our DIS business involves significant assumptions and judgments.  We recognize revenues primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered.  We estimate the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to receive from payer customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach.  These estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions, as discussed below.  The portfolios determined using the portfolio approach consist of the following payer customers:  \n•\nHealthcare Insurers/Health Plans\n•\nGovernment Payers\n•\nClient Payers\n61 \nTable \nof\n Contents \n•\nPatients\n    We have a standardized approach to estimate the amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to, including the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions.  Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience (along with the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding) is an integral part of the estimation process related to revenues and receivables.  Adjustments to our estimated contractual allowances and implicit patient price concessions are recorded in the current period as changes in estimates. Further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded upon settlement.  \n    We regularly assess the state of our billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability of receivables or revenue estimates. We believe that the collectability of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing processes, most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide. As such, we strive to implement “best practices” and endeavor to increase the use of electronic ordering to reduce the number of requisitions that we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing information. We believe that our collection and revenue estimation processes, along with our close monitoring of our billing operations, help to reduce the risk associated with material adjustments to reserve estimates.  However, changes to our estimate of the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price concessions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the period that the estimates are adjusted.  \n    The following table shows the approximate percentage of our total requisition volume and net revenues associated with our DIS business during 2024 applicable to each payer customer group: \n% of\n% of\nTotal DIS\nConsolidated\nVolume\nNet Revenues\nHealthcare insurers\n46%\n40%\nGovernment payers\n12\n13\nClient payers\n39\n33\nPatients *\n1\n11\nTotal DIS\n98%\n97%\n*Patients revenue includes coinsurance and deductible responsibilities; but volume associated with such revenue is reported under Healthcare insurers.\n    The following table shows net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 applicable to each payer customer group:\n    \n% of\nConsolidated\nNet Accounts\nReceivable\nHealthcare insurers \n26%\nGovernment payers\n7\nClient payers\n45\nPatients (including coinsurance and deductible responsibilities)\n20\nTotal DIS\n98%\n    Healthcare insurers/ Health Plans\n    Reimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on fee-for-service schedules and on capitated payment rates.  Under fee-for-service arrangements, healthcare insurers are billed at our list price.  Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and the terms of our contractual arrangements. \n    Substantially all of the accounts receivable due from healthcare insurers represent amounts billed under fee-for-service arrangements.  Collection of our net revenues from healthcare insurers is normally a function of providing complete and correct \n62 \nTable \nof\n Contents \nbilling information to the healthcare insurers within the various filing deadlines and generally occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing.  Provided we have billed healthcare insurers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, we determine if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and if so, we will reserve accordingly for the billing.\n    Under capitated arrangements with healthcare insurers, we recognize revenue based on a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member of an insurer's health plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us.  Under capitated payment arrangements, the healthcare insurers typically reimburse us in the same month services are performed, essentially giving rise to no outstanding accounts receivable at the end of a reporting period.  If any capitated payments are not received on a timely basis, we determine the cause and make a separate determination as to whether or not the collection of the amount from the healthcare insurer is at risk and, if so, would reserve accordingly.\n    Government payers\n    Reimbursements from domestic government payers are based on fee-for-service schedules set by governmental authorities, including traditional Medicare and Medicaid.  Reimbursements from government payers in Canada are based on a combination of fee-for-service schedules, with a cap on maximum billings, and capitated arrangements.  Net revenues recognized for fee-for-service arrangements principally consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience.  \n    Collection of our net revenues from government payers is normally a function of providing the complete and correct billing information within the various filing deadlines.  Collection generally occurs within 30 days of billing.  Provided we have billed government payers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, we determine if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and, if so, we will reserve for the billing accordingly.\n    Client payers\n    Client payers include physicians, hospitals, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis, and are billed based on a negotiated fee schedule.  Credit risk and ability to pay are more of a consideration for these payers than healthcare insurers and government payers.  Collection of consideration we expect to receive generally occurs within 60 to 90 days of billing.  \n    We principally estimate the allowance for credit losses for client payers based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding. To the extent that any individual client payers are identified that have deteriorated in credit quality, we establish allowances based on the individual risk characteristics of such customers.\n    Patients\n    \n    Uninsured patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules or fees negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients.  Insured patients (includes coinsurance and deductible responsibilities) are billed based on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers.  Collection of billings from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay.  Net revenues consist of amounts billed net of discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with our policies and implicit price concessions.  Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from patients, which considers historical collection experience (along with the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding) and other factors including current market conditions.  Patient billings are generally fully reserved for when the related service reaches 210 days outstanding.  Balances are automatically written off when they are sent to collection agencies.  Allowances are further adjusted for estimated recoveries of amounts sent to collection agencies based on historical collection experience, which is regularly monitored.  Collection of consideration we expect to receive generally occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing.\n    \n    Reserves for general and professional liability claims\n    As a general matter, providers of diagnostic information services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar claims.  These suits could involve claims for substantial damages.  Any professional liability litigation could also \n63 \nTable \nof\n Contents \nhave an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.  We maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that could result from providing, or failing to provide, clinical testing services, including inaccurate testing results, and other exposures.  Our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims; however, we are essentially self-insured for a significant portion of these claims.  While the basis for claims reserves is actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected loss experience, the process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to these types of claims involves a high degree of judgment.  Although we believe that our present reserves and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, it is possible that we may incur liabilities in excess of our recorded reserves or insurance coverage.  Changes in the facts and circumstances associated with claims could have a material impact on our results of operations (principally costs of services), cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are adjusted or paid.  See Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reserves for general and professional liability claims. \n    Reserves for other legal proceedings\n    Our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations, including inspections and audits by governmental agencies, in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.  Although we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency would not reach a different conclusion.  Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices.  In addition, certain federal and state statutes, including the \nqui tam\n provisions of federal and state false claims acts, allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers alleging inappropriate billing practices.  We are aware of certain pending lawsuits including class action lawsuits, and have received subpoenas related to billing practices.  See Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the various legal proceedings that we are involved in. \n    The process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to legal proceedings involves a high degree of judgment.  Management has established reserves for legal proceedings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  Changes in facts and circumstances related to such proceedings could lead to significant adjustments to reserve estimates for such matters and could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are adjusted or paid.\n    Accounting for and recoverability of goodwill\n    We do not amortize goodwill, but evaluate the recoverability and measure the potential impairment of our goodwill annually, or more frequently, in the case of other events that indicate a potential impairment.  We identified the following reporting units for goodwill impairment testing in 2024:\n•\nDIS business;\n•\nRisk assessment services business, which is part of our DS businesses\n    The DIS reporting unit components have been aggregated into a single reporting unit because they have similar economic characteristics, including similarities in financial performance, nature of products or services, nature of production processes and types of customers.\n    On a quarterly basis, we perform a review of our business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our fair value and our goodwill.  If such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill and record any noted impairment loss.  \n    The annual impairment test for goodwill includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value; the qualitative analysis may be performed prior to, or as an alternative to, performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we assess relevant events and circumstances, such as: (a) macroeconomic conditions; (b) industry and market considerations; (c) cost factors; (d) overall financial performance; (e) other relevant entity-specific events; (f) events affecting a reporting unit; and (g) a sustained decrease in share price.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting \n64 \nTable \nof\n Contents \nunit is less than its carrying value, then we are required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Otherwise, no further analysis is required.  Additionally, our policy is to update the fair value calculation of our reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis.  \n    The quantitative impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the carrying value is greater than our estimate of fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess.   We calculate the fair value of each reporting unit using either (i) a discounted cash flows analysis that converts future cash flow amounts into a single discounted present value amount or (ii) a market approach.  We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation.  The discounted cash flows analysis includes several unobservable inputs related to our own assumptions.  The assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flows model are based upon the best available information in the circumstances and include a forecast of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates that are commensurate with economic risks, assumed income tax rates and estimates of capital expenditures and working capital.  The fair values of the reporting units could be different if, for example, forecasted revenue growth rates, economic conditions, government regulations or actions by payers to control utilization of or reimbursement for healthcare services, turn out to be different than our assumptions or estimates.  Changes in the assumed discount rates due to changes in interest rates could also affect the estimated fair values of the reporting units.  We use a discount rate that considers a weighted average cost of capital plus an appropriate risk premium based upon the reporting unit being valued.  Our analysis also considers publicly available information regarding our market capitalization, as well as (i) the financial projections and future prospects of our business, including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements, and (ii) comparable sales prices, if available.  We believe our estimation methods are reasonable and reflect common valuation practices.\n    We perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, we performed a qualitative assessment for our DIS and risk assessment services reporting units.  Based on the totality of the information available for each reporting unit, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values were greater than the carrying values of the reporting values, and as such, no further analysis was required.  As a sensitivity, in conjunction with the most recent quantitative test performed for the year ended December 31, 2023, if the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units decreased by 10%, we would have concluded that our goodwill was not impaired.\n65 \nTable \nof\n Contents \nResults of Operations\n    \n    \nFor a comparison of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022, along with the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.  See \"Available Information.\"\n    Basis of Presentation\n    Our DIS business currently represents our one reportable business segment.

and\n•\npre-tax charges of $3 million recorded in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes, or $0.02 per diluted share, representing net losses associated with changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments\n; partially offset by\n•\n$11 million of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements, recorded in income tax expense, or $0.10 per diluted share.\n    \nNet Revenues \n    Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by 6.7% compared to the prior year. \n    DIS revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by 7.1% compared to the prior year.  For the year ended December 31, 2024:\n•\nThe increase in DIS revenues compared to the prior year was driven primarily by organic growth in the base business (which excludes COVID-19 testing) and, to a lesser extent, the impact of recent acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 testing.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, recent acquisitions contributed approximately 3.9% to DIS revenues.\n•\nDIS volume increased by 5.5% compared to the prior year primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions, which contributed approximately 4.8% to DIS volume, and, to a lesser extent, organic growth in the base business, partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 testing.\n•\nRevenue per requisition increased by 1.3% compared to the prior year principally due to an increase in the number of tests per requisition and favorable test mix, partially offset by the impact of the decrease in COVID-19 testing and the impact of the acquisition of LifeLabs (which has a lower revenue per requisition).\n•\nDIS revenues in the base business (including the impact of recent acquisitions) increased by 9.0% compared to the prior year.  \n•\nTesting volume in the base business (including the impact of recent acquisitions) was up 6.2% compared to the prior year.      \n•\nRevenue per requisition in the base business increased by 2.4% compared to the prior year principally due to an increase in the number of tests per requisition and favorable test mix, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of LifeLabs (which has a lower revenue per requisition).\n    DS revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased by 6.3% compared to the prior year primarily due to lower revenues associated with both our risk assessment services offered to insurers and our healthcare information technology businesses.\n            \n    Cost of Services\n    \nCost of services consists principally of costs for obtaining, transporting and testing specimens as well as facility costs used for the delivery of our services.\n    \nCost of services increased by $429 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year.  \nT\nhe increase wa\ns primari\nly driven by the impact of recent acquisitions, wage increases, higher supplies expense, and lower performance-based compensation in the prior year period, partially offset by cost savings and productivity improvements from our Invigorate program.\n    \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\n    \n    SG&A consists principally of the costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts, billing operations, credit loss expense and general management and administrative support, as well as administrative facility costs.\n68 \nTable \nof\n Contents \n    SG&A increased by $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year.  \nThe increase \nwas primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions, lower performance-based compensation in the prior year period, and higher depreciation expense.\n    The changes in the value of our deferred compensation obligations is largely offset by changes in the value of the associated investments, which are recorded in other income (expense), net. For further details regarding our deferred compensation plans, see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n    \n    \nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n    For the year ended December 31, 2024, amortization expense was $19 million higher than the prior year as a result of recent acquisitions.\n \n    \nOther Operating Expense, Net\n    Other operating expense, net includes miscellaneous income and expense items and other charges related to operating activities.  \n    For the year ended December 31, 2023, other operating expense, net principally includes a $29 million impairment charge on certain long-lived assets related to the shutdown of a business and, to a lesser extent, an $11 million loss associated with the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with previous acquisitions.\n    \n    Interest Expense, Net\n    \nInterest expense, net increased by $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the issuance during November 2023 of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.40% senior notes due 2033 and the issuance in August 2024 of $1.85 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes (see \"2024 Highlights\" above), partially offset by increased interest income (principally due to higher cash on hand) and lower borrowings under our secured receivables credit facility.\n    \n    \nOther Income (Expense), Net\n    Other income, net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to non-operating activities, such as gains and losses associated with investments and other non-operating assets.  \n    For the year ended December 31, 2024, other income (expense), net included included $18 million of gains associated with investments in our deferred compensation plans and an $8 million gain associated with a foreign exchange forward contract utilized in conjunction with an acquisition.\n    For the year ended December 31, 2023, other income (expense), net included $20 million of gains associated with investments in our deferred compensation plans.\n    \n    \nIncome Tax Expense\n    Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $273 million and $248 million, respectively.  The increase in income tax expense compared to the prior year was driven by an increase in the effective income tax rate and an increase in income before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees.\n    The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 23.2% and 22.0%, respectively.  The increase was principally due to a change in return to provision true-ups.  The effective income tax rates benefited from $9 million and $11 million of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n    \nEquity in Earnings of Equity Method Investees, Net of Taxes\n69 \nTable \nof\n Contents \n    \n    For the year ended December 31, 2024, there was a $7 million decrease in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes, compared to the prior year primarily due to a $12 million increase in losses associated with changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments, partially offset by increased demand for testing services at our diagnostic information services joint venture.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n    We address our exposure to market risks, principally the risk of changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  We seek to mitigate the variability in cash outflows that result from changes in interest rates by maintaining a balanced mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt obligations.  In order to achieve this objective, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements.  Interest rate swap agreements involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts.  Net settlements are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense, net.  We believe that our exposures to foreign exchange impacts and changes in commodity prices are not material to our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  For further details regarding our significant accounting policies on interest rate risk and foreign currency, see Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements. \n    \n    As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of our debt was estimated at approximately $6.1 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, principally using quoted prices in active markets and yields for the same or similar types of borrowings, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the debt by $112 million and $127 million, respectively.  A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates (representing 35 basis points as of December 31, 2024 and 50 basis points as of December 31, 2023) would potentially reduce the estimated fair value of our debt by approximately $184 million and $139 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n    Borrowings under our secured receivables credit facility and our senior unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates.  Interest on our secured receivables credit facility is based on either commercial paper rates for highly rated issuers or the adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"Term SOFR\"), plus a spread.  Interest on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility is based on certain published rates plus an applicable margin based on changes in our public debt ratings. As such, our borrowing cost under this credit arrangement is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in our public debt ratings.  As of December 31, 2024, the borrowing rates under these debt instruments were: for our secured receivables credit facility, commercial paper rates for highly rated issuers or the adjusted Term SOFR, plus a spread of 0.80%; and for our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the adjusted Term SOFR, plus 1.00%.  As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under either our $600 million secured receivables credit facility or our $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.     \n    \n    During October 2024, we entered into various fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $700 million and various interest rates ranging from SOFR plus a spread of 1.40% to SOFR plus a spread of 1.43%.  These derivative financial instruments are accounted for as fair value hedges of a portion of our 2034 Senior Notes.  The aggregate fair value of these fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements was $34 million, in a liability position, as of December 31, 2024.\n    \n    Based on our net exposure to interest rate changes, a hypothetical 10% change to the variable rate component of our variable rate indebtedness would not materially change our annual interest expense.  A hypothetical 10% change in the SOFR curve (representing a 41 basis points change in the weighted average yield) would potentially change the fair value of our fixed-to-variable interest rate swap liabilities by $23 million.\n    \n    For further details regarding our outstanding debt and our financial instruments and hedging activities, see Notes 13 and 15, respectively, to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n    \nRisk Associated with Investment Portfolio\n    Our investment portfolio primarily includes equity investments comprised mostly of strategic holdings in companies concentrated in the life sciences and healthcare industries.  Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded in \n70 \nTable \nof\n Contents \ncurrent earnings in our consolidated statement of operations.  Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values (which consist of investments in preferred and common shares of private companies) are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.\n    We regularly evaluate equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values to determine if there are any indicators that the investments are impaired.  The carrying value of our equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values was $37 million as of December 31, 2024.  In conjunction with the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, we considered whether the carrying values of our investments were impaired and concluded that no such impairment existed.  \n    \n    We do not hedge our equity price risk.  The impact of an adverse movement in equity prices on our holdings in privately held companies cannot be easily quantified, as our ability to realize returns on investments depends on, among other things, the enterprises’ ability to raise additional capital or derive cash inflows from continuing operations or through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers or private sales.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n          \n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n(dollars in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,334 \n$\n1,272 \n$\n62 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(2,548)\n(1,061)\n(1,487)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n1,084 \n160 \n924 \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(7)\n— \n(7)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(137)\n$\n371 \n$\n(508)\n    \nCash and Cash Equivalents\n    Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly-liquid short-term investments.  Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 totaled $549 million and $686 million, respectively.  \n    As of December 31, 2024, approximately 23% of our $549 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the United States.  \n    \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n    Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1,334 million, and increased $62 million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of increased operating income.\n    \n    Days sales outstanding (\"DSO\"), a measure of billing and collection efficiency, was 48 days as of December 31, 2024 and 50 days as of December 31, 2023. \n    \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n    Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $2,548 million and $1,061 million, respectively. The $1,487 million increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, was primarily a result of increased cash used for business acquisitions (see \"2024 Highlights\" above).\n    \nCash Flows from Financing Activities \n    Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1,084 million, compared to $160 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The $924 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of the issuance of $1.85 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in August 2024 (see \"2024 Highlights\" above) and fewer share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2024.  Such impacts were partially offset by, among other things, in the year ended December 31, 2023, the $750 million of gross proceeds received in connection with \n71 \nTable \nof\n Contents \nthe issuance of 6.40% senior notes and, in the year ended December 31, 2024, by the repayment in full of the outstanding indebtedness under our $300 million of 4.25% senior notes.\n    During the year ended December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings or repayments under our secured receivables credit facility or our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\n    During the year ended December 31, 2023, we borrowed $1.7 billion under our secured receivables credit facility, which was repaid prior to December 31, 2023.  Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we borrowed $125 million under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was repaid prior to December 31, 2023.  \n    \n    For details regarding our debt and related transactions, see Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n    \nDividend Program\n    \n    During each of the four quarters of 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per common share.  During each of the four quarters of 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.71 per common share.  In January 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a 6.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.75 to $0.80 per share, or $3.20 per share annually, commencing with the dividend payable in April 2025.\n    \nShare Repurchases\n    \n    \nAs\n of December 31, 2024, $0.9 billion remained available under our share repurchase authorization.  The share repurchase authorization has no set expiration or termination date.\n    For the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock for $150 million.\n    For the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of our common stock for $276 million.\n    \n    For further details regarding our share repurchases, see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n    \n    \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n     A description of the terms of our indebtedness and related debt service requirements is contained in Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n    A discussion of our lease obligations is contained in Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements. \n    A discussion of our noncancellable commitments to purchase products or services is contained in Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements. \n    \nEquity Method Investees\n    \n    Our equity method investees primarily consist of a diagnostic information services joint venture and an investment in a fund that purchases strategic holdings in private companies in the healthcare industry.  Such investees are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Our investment in equity method investees is less than 5% of our consolidated total assets.  Our proportionate share of income before income taxes associated with our equity method investees is less than 5% of our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees.  We have no material unconditional obligations or guarantees to, or in support of, our equity method investees and their operations.\n    In conjunction with the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, we considered whether the carrying values of our equity method investments were impaired and concluded that no such impairment existed.\n    \n    \nRequirements and Capital Resources\n72 \nTable \nof\n Contents \n    We estimate that we will invest approximately $500 million during 2025 for capital expenditures to support and grow our existing operations, principally related to investments in laboratory equipment and facilities, including laboratory automations and information technology to support our diagnostic offerings.\n    We have $600 million of 3.50% senior notes due March 2025. \n    In February 2025, we committed to a multi-year project (\"Project Nova\") to modernize our \"Order to Cash\" business processes including related information technology infrastructure and underlying enabling technologies.  We expect to deliver value throughout the implementation of Project Nova, as it unlocks a variety of streamlined operational benefits, reduced technology-related operating costs, accelerated revenue opportunities and improvements to the customer and patient experience. Total project-related cash expenditures are estimated to be approximately $250 million to $310 million with approximately 60% consisting of capital expenditures and; the remainder consisting of operating expenses (primarily related to system conversion costs, compensation costs associated with team members dedicated to the project, and program management and training costs) to be incurred over the life of the project with the final phases expected to be completed in the 2031 to 2032 timeframe.  We expect to fund the Project Nova-related expenditures with cash from operations.  For 2025, total project-related cash expenditures are estimated to be approximately $15 million.  Annual financial benefits are projected to increase over time as major elements of the project are completed generating an appropriate return on investment. \n    During November 2024, we amended our $600 million secured receivables credit facility. The amendment extended the maturity of the facility to November 2026.  Additionally, the amended facility includes a $200 million uncommitted accordion which, if utilized, brings the total capacity under the facility to $800 million.  For further details regarding our credit facilities, see Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n    As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.3 billion of borrowing capacity available under our existing credit facilities, including $527 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and $750 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.  There were no borrowings under these credit facilities as of December 31, 2024. In support of our risk management program, $73 million in letters of credit under the secured receivables credit facility were outstanding as of December 31, 2024.  \n    Our secured receivables credit facility is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, and certain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility. Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility is also subject to certain financial covenants and limitations on indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all such applicable financial covenants.  \n    We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will provide sufficient financial flexibility to fund seasonal and other working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other obligations, cash dividends on common shares, share repurchases and additional growth opportunities, including acquisitions, for the foreseeable future.  However, should it become necessary, we believe that our credit profile should provide us with access to additional financing in order to fund normal business operations, make interest payments, fund additional growth opportunities, including acquisitions, and satisfy upcoming debt maturities.  \n    \n    \nImpact of New Accounting Standards\n    The adoption of new accounting standards (if any) is discussed in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.    \n    The impacts of recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective (if any) on our audited consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n \n73 \nTable \nof\n Contents \nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n    \n    The management of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in \n“Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)”\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 is effective.\n    The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n    \n    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n    On August 23, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of LifeLabs, Inc. and the partnership interests of BPC Lab Finance LP (collectively, \"LifeLabs\").  While the Company has extended its oversight and monitoring processes that support internal control over financial reporting, as well as its disclosure controls and procedures, the Company continues to integrate the acquired operations of LifeLabs. As such the Company has excluded LifeLabs from its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. This exclusion is in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s guidance that a recently acquired business may be omitted from the assessment scope for up to one year from the date of acquisition. LifeLabs had total assets that represented approximately 3% of the Company’s consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2024, and total revenues that represented approximately 2% of the Company’s consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this annual report, audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 and issued their audit report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting included herein. \n74 \nTable \nof\n Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded LifeLabs, Inc. and BPC Lab Finance LP (collectively, “LifeLabs”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded LifeLabs from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. LifeLabs is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 3% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nF-1\nTable \nof\n Contents\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Diagnostic Information Services (DIS) Business Accounts Receivable - Contractual Allowances\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management estimates the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive from payer customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach. These estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price concessions. The Company's consolidated accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, balance as of December 31, 2024, was $1,304 million, of which a significant portion related to the DIS business.  Net revenues recognized from healthcare insurers and government payers consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and, additionally for healthcare insurers, the terms of the Company’s contractual arrangements. The process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of accounts receivable associated with the DIS business involves significant judgment and estimation.  \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of DIS business accounts receivable - contractual allowances is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of contractual allowances, and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to the estimate of contractual allowances.  \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of DIS business accounts receivable, which included controls over management’s methodology and data used to estimate contractual allowances. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the estimate of contractual allowances, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology; (ii) testing, on a sample basis, the completeness and accuracy of the historical contractual allowance and collection data used in developing the estimate of contractual allowances; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions used to estimate contractual allowances by comparing actual cash collected to the prior year estimate of net accounts receivable.\nAcquisition of LifeLabs – Valuation of Customer-Related and Trade Name Intangible Assets\nAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 23, 2024, the Company acquired LifeLabs for net consideration of $1,003 million. Of the acquired assets, $335 million of customer-related intangible assets and $99 million of trade name intangible assets were recorded. The fair values of the customer-related intangible assets and trade name intangible assets were determined by management using a multi-period excess earnings method and a relief from royalty method, \nF-2\nTable \nof\n Contents\nrespectively. Management’s estimates of fair values were principally determined based on projections of cash flows and include significant judgments and assumptions relating to customer attrition rates for the customer-related intangible assets and royalty rates for the trade name intangible assets. The projected cash flows were discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the date of the acquisition.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of customer-related and trade name intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of LifeLabs is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the customer-related and trade name intangible assets acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to projections of cash flows, customer attrition rate, and discount rate for the customer-related intangible assets and projections of cash flows, royalty rate, and discount rate for the trade name intangible assets; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the customer-related  and trade name intangible assets acquired. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates of the customer-related and trade name intangible assets acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to projections of cash flows, customer attrition rate, and discount rate for the customer-related intangible assets and projections of cash flows, royalty rate, and discount rate for the trade name intangible assets. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to projections of cash flows for the customer-related and trade name intangible assets involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the LifeLabs business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods and (ii) the reasonableness of the customer attrition rate and discount rate assumptions for the customer-related intangible assets and the royalty rate and discount rate assumptions for the trade name intangible assets. \n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 20, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1995.\n \nF-3\nTable of Contents \nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED

BUSINESS\n    \n    \nBackground\n    \n    Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its subsidiaries (\"Quest Diagnostics\" or the \"Company\") work across the healthcare ecosystem to create a healthier world, one life at a time.  The Company's diagnostic information services (\"DIS\") business provides diagnostic insights from the results of its laboratory testing to empower people, physicians, and organizations to take action to improve health outcomes.  Derived from one of the world's largest databases of de-identifiable clinical lab results, the diagnostic insights reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management.  In the right hands and with the right context, the diagnostic insights can inspire actions that transform lives and create a healthier world.  The Company provides services to a broad range of customers within its primary customer channels - physicians (including those associated with accountable care organizations (\"ACOs\") and Federally Qualified Health Centers (\"FQHCs\")), hospitals, and patients and consumers.  Other customers include health plans, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories.  The Company offers broad access to clinical testing through a network of laboratories, patient service centers, phlebotomists in physician offices, and connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile phlebotomists, nurses and other health and wellness professionals.  The Company's large in-house staff of medical and scientific experts, including medical directors, scientific directors, genetic counselors and board-certified geneticists, provide medical and scientific consultation to healthcare providers and patients regarding the Company's tests and test results, and help them best utilize Quest Diagnostics' services to improve outcomes and enhance satisfaction.  The Company's Diagnostic Solutions (\"DS\") group, which represents the balance of the Company's consolidated net revenues, includes the Company's risk assessment services business, which offers solutions for insurers, and the Company's healthcare information technology businesses, which offer solutions for healthcare providers and payers.\n \n \n2.    \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n    \n    \nPrinciples of Consolidation\n    \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by the Company through its direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest.  Additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which the Company has a variable interest and for which the Company is the “primary beneficiary” as it has both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\n    Income attributable to the minority interest in the Company's majority owned and controlled consolidated subsidiaries is recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations and the noncontrolling interest is reflected as a separate component of consolidated stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\n        \n    \nEquity Method Investments\n    \nInvestments in entities which the Company does not control, but in which it has a substantial ownership interest (generally between \n20\n% and \n49\n%) and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  These investments are classified as investments in equity method investees in the consolidated balance sheet.  The Company records its pro rata share of the earnings, adjusted for accretion of basis difference, of these investments in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Company reviews its investments in equity method investees for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n \n    \nUse of Estimates\n    \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and \nF-9\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \n    \nRevenue Recognition\n    \nThe Company recognizes as revenue the amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for goods sold or services rendered primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered (see Note 3).  Net revenues from Medicare and Medicaid programs were approximately \n11\n% of the Company's consolidated net revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  Net revenues from government programs in Canada were approximately \n2\n% of the Company's consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n    \nTaxes on Income\n    \nThe provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.  Current and deferred income taxes are measured based on the tax laws that are enacted as of the balance sheet date of the relevant reporting period.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted.  Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized only if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.\n \n    \nEarnings Per Share\n    \nThe Company's unvested restricted stock units that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and, therefore, are included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share using the two-class method.  Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, adjusted for earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, adjusted for earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding after giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.  Potentially dilutive common shares include the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and performance share units granted under the Company's Amended and Restated Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan (“ELTIP”) and its Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Long-Term Incentive Plan (“DLTIP”), as well as the dilutive effect of accelerated share repurchase agreements (\"ASRs\"), if applicable.  Earnings allocable to participating securities include the portion of dividends declared as well as the portion of undistributed earnings during the period allocable to participating securities.\n    \nStock-Based Compensation \n    \nThe Company measures stock-based compensation for equity awards at fair value on the date of grant and records stock-based compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards.  As such, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost\n \nonly for those stock-based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period, based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants.  The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change.  The terms of the Company's performance share units allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals, which are based on the financial performance of the Company and the total shareholder return of the Company relative to an index of peer companies (\"relative TSR\"), specified in the awards.  For performance share units with a goal based on the financial performance of the Company, stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on management's best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that will be earned.  The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share units expected to be earned for these awards is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change.  For performance share units with a market-based relative TSR goal, stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the award regardless of the actual number of shares earned.\n  For further details regarding stock-based compensation, see Note 17.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \nFair Value Measurements\n    \nThe Company determines fair value measurements used in its consolidated financial statements based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants exclusive of any transaction costs, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market.\n    Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy.  The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.\nLevel 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.\n    \nForeign Currency\n    \n    \nThe Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.  The functional currency of the Company's foreign operating subsidiaries generally is the applicable local currency.  Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates as of the end of the reporting period.  Income and expense items are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year.  Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, are included within other operating expense, net\n \nin the consolidated statements of operations.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses have historically not been material.  The Company may be exposed to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates primarily under certain intercompany receivables and payables.  From time to time, the Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of the eventual net cash inflows or outflows resulting from these intercompany transactions.  The Company's foreign exchange exposure is not material to the Company's consolidated financial condition.  The Company does not hedge its net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries because it views those investments as long-term in nature.\n    \nCash and Cash Equivalents \n \n    \nCash and cash equivalents include all highly-liquid investments with original maturities, at the time acquired by the Company, of three months or less.\n    \nConcentration of Credit Risk   \n    \nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments.  The Company's policy is to place its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in highly-rated financial instruments and institutions.  Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigated by the diversity of the Company's payers and their dispersion across many different geographic regions, and credit risk is concentrated among certain payers who are large buyers of the Company's services.  To reduce risk, the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of these payers and, consequently, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure, with respect to these payers, is limited.  While the Company has receivables due from federal, state and foreign governmental agencies, the Company does not believe that such receivables represent a credit risk since the related healthcare programs are funded by federal, state and foreign governments, and payment is primarily dependent on submitting appropriate documentation timely.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, receivables due from government payers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs represented approximately \n6\n% and \n7\n%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable.  As of December 31, 2024, receivables due from Canadian government payers represented approximately \n1\n% of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable.  The portion of the Company's accounts receivable due from patients comprises the largest portion of credit risk.  As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, receivables due from patients represented approximately \n20\n% of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable.  The Company applies assumptions and judgments including historical collection experience (including the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding) for assessing collectability and determining net revenues and accounts receivable from patients.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\n    \nAccounts receivable are reported net of allowances for credit losses.  \n    \n    When estimating its allowance for credit losses, the Company pools its trade receivables based on the following customer types: healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers and patients, which are described in Note 3.  The Company principally estimates the allowance for credit losses by pool based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding.  To the extent that any individual payers are identified that have deteriorated in credit quality, the Company removes the customers from their respective pools and establishes allowances based on the individual risk characteristics of such customers.\n    \nInventories\n    \nInventories, which consist principally of finished goods testing supplies and reagents, are valued at the lower of cost (principally first in, first out method) or net realizable value.\n \n    \nProperty, Plant and Equipment   \n    \nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application development activities and expensed as incurred for preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities.  Capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software, payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with the internal-use software project, and interest costs incurred, when material, while developing internal-use software.  Capitalization of such costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.  Costs for maintenance and training are expensed as incurred.  The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of major capital projects.  Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over the expected useful lives of the assets.  Depreciation and amortization are principally provided on the straight-line method over expected useful asset lives as of December 31, 2024 as follows: \n•\nbuildings and improvements, ranging up to thirty-one and a half years; \n•\nlaboratory equipment and furniture and fixtures, ranging from \nfive\n to \ntwelve years\n; \n•\nleasehold improvements, the lesser of the useful life of the improvement or the remaining life of the building or lease, as applicable; and \n•\ncomputer software developed or obtained for internal use, principally \nfive\n to \nten years\n.\n        \n    \nGoodwill\n    \nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the acquiree (including the fair value of non-controlling interests) over the recognized bases of the net identifiable assets acquired and includes the future economic benefits from other assets that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.  Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically reviewed for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value.  \n    On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the Company and its goodwill.  If such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred, the Company would perform an impairment test of goodwill as of the end of the quarter and record any noted impairment loss.  \n    The goodwill test is performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  The annual impairment test includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value; the qualitative test may be performed prior to, or as an alternative to, performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its \nF-12\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \ncarrying value, then the Company is required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Otherwise, no further analysis is required.  Additionally, the Company's policy is to update the fair value calculation of its reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis.\n    The quantitative impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  The Company calculates the fair value of each reporting unit using either (i) a discounted cash flows analysis that converts future cash flow amounts into a single discounted present value amount or (ii) a market approach.  The Company assesses the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time that the valuation is performed.  The Company compares the estimate of fair value for the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit.  If the carrying value is greater than the estimate of fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess. \n    \n    The Company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company performed a qualitative impairment test and, based on the totality of information available for the reporting units, the Company concluded that it was more likely than \nno\nt that the estimated fair values of the reporting units were greater than the carrying values of the reporting units and, as such, no further analysis was required.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with its policy to perform a quantitative test on a periodic basis, the Company updated the fair value calculations for its reporting units, performed the quantitative impairment test, and concluded that goodwill was \nno\nt impaired.\n \n    \nIntangible Assets\n    \nIntangible assets are recognized at fair value, as an asset apart from goodwill if the asset (i) arises from contractual or other legal rights, or (ii) is separable.  Intangible assets, principally representing the cost of customer-related intangible assets, non-competition agreements, acquired technology-related intangible assets and trade name intangible assets, are capitalized and amortized on the straight-line method over their expected useful lives, which generally range from \nfive\n to \ntwenty-five years\n.  Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, consisting principally of acquired trade names, are not amortized, but instead are periodically reviewed for impairment.  \n    The Company reviews indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is more than its estimated fair value.  The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test is performed at least annually, or more frequently in the case of other events that indicate a potential impairment.  \n    Based upon the Company’s most recent annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarter of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company concluded that indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.\n    The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets (including amortizable intangible assets), other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  Evaluation of possible impairment is based on the Company's ability to recover the asset from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations.  If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of the asset.\n    \nInvestments\n    \n    \nThe Company's investments (except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) include:\n•\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values, including investments comprised mostly of strategic holdings in companies concentrated in the life sciences and healthcare industries; as well as participant-directed investments of deferred employee compensation and related Company matching contributions held in trusts pursuant to the Company's supplemental deferred compensation plans (see Note 17).  These investments are measured at fair value with both realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in current earnings within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, gains/(losses) from all equity investments with readily determinable fair values totaled $\n18\n million, $\n20\n million, and $(\n55\n) million, respectively.  See Note 7 for a discussion of the fair value of such investments. \nF-13\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n•\nEquity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values consist of investments in preferred and common shares of privately held companies.  These investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.  The Company regularly evaluates these equity investments to determine if there are any indicators that the investment is impaired; \nno\n impairment charges were recognized related to these investments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  The carrying value of these investments was $\n37\n million and $\n18\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Such amounts were included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.\n•\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities of privately-held companies.  These investments are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses presented in other comprehensive (loss) income.  The carrying amount of these investments was $\n0 million\n and $\n2\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  See Note 7 for a discussion of the fair value of such investments.\n \n    \nDerivative Financial Instruments\n    \nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, from time to time, to manage its exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates and foreign currencies.  This strategy includes the use of interest rate swap agreements, forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, interest rate lock agreements and foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to movements in interest and currency rates.  The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities.  These policies prohibit holding or issuing derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments that contain credit risk-related contingent features or requirements to post collateral.\n    \nInterest Rate Risk\n    The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents and its debt obligations.  Interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents may fluctuate as interest rates change; however, due to their relatively short maturities, the Company does not hedge these assets or their investment cash flows and the impact of interest rate risk is not material.  The Company's debt obligations consist of fixed-rate and, from time to time, variable-rate debt instruments.  The Company's primary objective is to achieve the lowest overall cost of funding while managing the variability in cash outflows within an acceptable range.  In order to achieve this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements.  Interest rate swap agreements involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts.  Net settlements between the counterparties are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense, net.\n    The Company accounts for these derivatives as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.  The fair value is based upon model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets including certain financial information and certain assumptions regarding past, present and future market conditions.  For a derivative instrument that has been formally designated as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument along with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  For derivatives that have been formally designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Upon maturity or early termination of an effective interest rate swap agreement designated as a cash flow hedge, unrealized gains or losses are deferred in stockholders' equity, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings, which is when the Company recognizes interest expense on the hedged cash flows.  At inception and quarterly thereafter, the Company formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.  After the initial quantitative assessment, this analysis is initially performed on a qualitative basis and, if it is determined that the hedging relationship was and continues to be highly effective, no further analysis is required.  All components of each derivative financial instrument's gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses related to a discontinued cash flow hedge shall continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur.  If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the originally specified time period, the Company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss are classified into earnings immediately.\n \nF-14\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \nComprehensive Income (Loss)\n    \n    \nComprehensive income (loss) encompasses all changes in stockholders' equity (except those arising from transactions with stockholders) and includes:\n•\nForeign currency translation adjustments; \n•\nNet deferred gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, which represent deferred gains (losses), net of tax, on interest rate-related derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges, net of amounts reclassified to interest expense (see Notes 15 and 16); and\n•\nNet changes in available-for-sale debt securities, which represent unrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities.\n        \n    \nAdvertising Costs    \n    \nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, advertising costs were $\n28\n million, $\n31\n million and $\n74\n million, respectively.\n    \nNew Accounting Standards \n    \n    \n    \nIn November 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which will require companies to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\").  The pronouncement is effective for annual filings for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for interim periods within the year ended December 31, 2025.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n    \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which will require companies to make additional income tax disclosures.  The pronouncement is effective for annual filings for the year ended December 31, 2025.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n    \nIn March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") issued a rule which will require companies to make certain climate-related disclosures in periodic filings.  The rule includes certain disclosures in the footnotes of the financial statements: \n•\ncapitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise;\n•\ncapitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates if they are used as a material component of a registrant’s plans to achieve its disclosed climate-related targets or goals; and\n•\nwhether estimates and assumptions used to produce the financial statements were materially impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with severe weather events and other natural conditions or any disclosed climate-related targets or transition plans. \n    The footnote disclosures were originally effective for annual filings for the year ended December 31, 2025.  However, in April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed implementation of the new disclosure requirements pending judicial review. Once the litigation is resolved, and if the rule remains in effect, the SEC will announce a new effective date.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the rule.\n    In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which will require companies to disaggregate certain income statement expenses.  The pronouncement is effective for annual filings for the year ended December 31, 2027 and for interim periods within the year ended December 31, 2028.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n3.    \nREVENUE RECOGNITION\n    \nDIS\n    Net revenues in the Company’s DIS business accounted for greater than \n95\n% of the Company’s consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions.  The DIS business, which provides clinical testing services and other services, satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered.  The Company estimates the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to receive from payer customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach. These estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions, as discussed below. The portfolios determined using the portfolio approach consist of the following groups of payer customers: healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers and patients.  Contracts in the DIS business do not contain significant financing components based on the typical period of time between performance of services and collection of consideration.\n    The process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant judgment and estimation.  The Company follows a standard process, which considers historical denial and collection experience and other factors (including the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding), to estimate contractual allowances and implicit price concessions, recording adjustments in the current period as changes in estimates.  Further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded upon settlement.\n    The following are descriptions of the DIS business’ portfolios:\n    \nHealthcare Insurers/Health Plans \n    Reimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on negotiated fee-for-service schedules and on capitated payment rates.  Under fee-for-service arrangements, healthcare insurers are billed at the Company's list price.  Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and the terms of the Company’s contractual arrangements. \n    Collection of the Company's net revenues from healthcare insurers is normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the healthcare insurers within the various filing deadlines and generally occurs within \n30\n to \n60\n days of billing.  Provided the Company has billed healthcare insurers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, the Company determines if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and if so, it will reserve accordingly for the billing.\n    Under capitated arrangements with healthcare insurers, the Company recognizes revenue based on a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member of an insurer's health plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by the Company.  Healthcare insurers typically reimburse the Company under capitated arrangements in the same month services are performed, essentially giving rise to no outstanding accounts receivable at the end of a reporting period.  If any capitated payments are not received on a timely basis, the Company determines the cause and makes a separate determination as to whether or not the collection of the amount from the healthcare insurer is at risk and, if so, would reserve accordingly.\n    \nGovernment Payers\n    Reimbursements from domestic government payers are based on fee-for-service schedules set by governmental authorities, including traditional Medicare and Medicaid.  Reimbursements from government payers in Canada are based on a combination of fee-for-service schedules, with a cap on maximum billings, and capitated arrangements.  Net revenues recognized for fee-for-service arrangements principally consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and other factors. \nF-16\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    Collection of the Company's net revenues from government payers is normally a function of providing the complete and correct billing information within the various filing deadlines and generally occurs within \n30\n days of billing.  Provided the Company has billed government payers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, the Company determines if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and, if so, it will reserve for the billing accordingly.\n    \nClient Payers \n    Client payers include physicians, hospitals, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis, and are billed based on negotiated fee schedules.  Credit risk and ability to pay are more of a consideration for these payers than healthcare insurers and government payers.  Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive generally occurs within \n60\n to \n90\n days of billing.  \n    The Company principally estimates the allowance for credit losses for client payers based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding. To the extent that any individual client payers are identified that have deteriorated in credit quality, the Company establishes allowances based on the individual risk characteristics of such customers.\n    \nPatients\n    Uninsured patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules or fees negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients.  Insured patients (includes coinsurance and deductible responsibilities) are billed based on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers.  Collection of billings from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay.  Net revenues consist of amounts billed net of discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with the Company’s policies and implicit price concessions.  Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from patients, which considers historical collection experience (including the period of time that the receivables have been outstanding) and other factors including current market conditions. Patient billings are generally fully reserved for when the related service reaches \n210\n days outstanding.  Balances are automatically written off when they are sent to collection agencies.  Allowances are further adjusted for estimated recoveries of amounts sent to collection agencies based on historical collection experience, which is regularly monitored.  Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive generally occurs within \n30\n to \n60\n days of billing.\n    \nDS\n    The Company’s DS businesses primarily satisfy their performance obligations and recognize revenues when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.  Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive generally occurs within \n30\n to \n60\n days of billing.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \nThe approximate percentage of net revenues by type of payer customer was as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nHealthcare insurers:\nFee-for-service\n37\n \n%\n37\n \n%\n38\n \n%\nCapitated\n3\n \n3\n \n3\n \nTotal healthcare insurers\n40\n \n40\n \n41\n \nGovernment payers (principally fee-for-service)\n13\n \n11\n \n11\n \nClient payers\n33\n \n34\n \n33\n \nPatients (including coinsurance and deductible responsibilities)\n11\n \n12\n \n12\n \nTotal DIS\n97\n \n97\n \n97\n \nDS\n3\n \n3\n \n3\n \nNet revenues\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n    For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, substantially all of the Company’s services were provided within the United States.

Of such amount, $\n30\n million was prepaid during the year ended December 31, 2023.  In the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, such $\n30\n million is included in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, with a corresponding offset in other investing activities.\n    \nThe acquisitions preliminarily resulted in goodwill of $\n1.1\n billion, $\n862\n million of which is deductible for tax purposes.  See the table below for a preliminary summary of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which may be revised as additional information becomes available during the measurement periods.\n    \nAcquisition of select assets of Lenco Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc. (\"Lenco\")\n    On February 12, 2024, the Company acquired select assets of Lenco, an independent clinical diagnostic laboratory provider serving physicians in New York, in an all-cash transaction for $\n111\n million.  \n    \nAcquisition of select assets of PathAI Diagnostics\n    On June 10, 2024, the Company acquired select assets of PathAI Diagnostics, a business that provides anatomic and digital pathology laboratory services, in an all-cash transaction for $\n100\n million.\n    \n    \nAcquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of LifeLabs Inc. and all of the partnership interests of BPC Lab Finance LP (collectively, \"LifeLabs\")\n    On August 23, 2024, the Company acquired LifeLabs in an all-cash transaction for approximately CAN $\n1.35\n billion (approximately USD $\n1\n billion), net of cash acquired.  LifeLabs provides laboratory diagnostic information and digital health connectivity systems in Canada.  The acquisition price is subject to a customary net working capital adjustment, which is not expected to be material.  The Company funded the acquisition with a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes (see Note 13 for further details).\n    Following the acquisition in August 2024, LifeLabs contributed $\n241\n million to the Company's consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n    The purchase price allocation in the table below is based upon a preliminary valuation and the Company's estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period as the valuation is finalized. Management is currently in the process of verifying data and finalizing information related to the valuation and recording of identifiable intangible assets, certain other assets and liabilities, and the corresponding effect on the amount of goodwill.\n    The fair values of the customer-related intangible assets and the trade name intangible assets in the table below were determined by management using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, and a relief from royalty method, respectively. Management’s estimates of fair value were principally determined based on projections of cash flows and include significant judgments and assumptions relating to customer attrition rates for the customer-related intangible assets and royalty rates for the trade name intangible assets. The projected cash flows were discounted to determine the present values of the assets at the date of the acquisition.

Based on the purchase price allocation, the assets acquired primarily consist of $\n222\n million of tax-deductible goodwill and $\n53\n million of customer-related intangible assets. The intangible assets are being amortized over a useful life of \n15\n years.\n    \nAcquisition of Haystack Oncology, Inc.\n    On June 20, 2023, the Company acquired Haystack Oncology, Inc. (\"Haystack\"), an early-stage oncology company focused on minimal residual disease testing to aid in the detection of residual or recurring cancer and better inform therapy decisions.  The acquisition was an all-cash transaction for $\n392\n million, net of $\n1\n million of cash acquired, which consisted of cash consideration of $\n304\n million and contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n88\n million.  Under the contingent consideration obligation, the seller can receive up to $\n100\n million of additional consideration dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks through 2028 and up to an additional $\n50\n million of consideration dependent upon the Company receiving reimbursement coverage from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). Based on the purchase price allocation, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed consist of $\n267\n million of goodwill (\nno\nne of which is tax-deductible), $\n145\n million of technology-related intangible assets, $\n23\n million of deferred income tax liabilities, $\n8\n million of operating lease right-of-use assets and related operating lease liabilities, and $\n3\n million of property, plant and equipment. The intangible assets are being amortized over a useful life of \n15\n years. For further details regarding the fair value of the Company's contingent consideration, see Note 7.\n    \n2022 Acquisitions\n    During 2022, the Company completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $\n162\n million (including contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n18\n million), net of cash acquired, including the acquisition discussed below.  The 2022 acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $\n121\n million, of which $\n103\n million is deductible for tax purposes.  These acquisitions also resulted in $\n45\n million of intangible assets, principally comprised of customer-related intangible assets.\nF-24\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \nAcquisition of Pack Health, LLC\n    \nOn February 1, 2022, the Company acquired Pack Health, LLC, a patient engagement company that helps individuals adopt healthier behaviors to improve outcomes, in an all cash transaction for $\n123\n million, net of $\n4\n million cash acquired, which consisted of cash consideration of $\n105\n million and contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n18\n million.  Based on the purchase price allocation, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed consist of $\n96\n million of goodwill (of which $\n78\n million was tax-deductible on the acquisition date), $\n30\n million of intangible assets, $\n5\n million of operating lease right-of-use assets, $\n5\n million of operating lease liabilities and $(\n3\n) million of working capital. The intangible assets consist primarily of customer-related assets which are being amortized over a useful life of \n15\n years.\n    \n    General Information\n    The acquisitions described above were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  As such, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their estimated fair values as of the closing date.  The goodwill recorded primarily includes the expected synergies resulting from combining the operations of the acquired entities with those of the Company and the value associated with an assembled workforce and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.  All of the goodwill acquired in connection with these acquisitions has been allocated to the Company's DIS business.  For further details regarding business segment information, see Note 19. \n    Except for the acquisition of LifeLabs (see above), supplemental pro forma combined financial information, and financial information subsequent to the acquisition close dates, has not been presented as the impact of the other acquisitions is not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.  Additionally, for such other acquisitions, it is impracticable to provide this financial information due to a variety of factors, including access to historical information and the operations of the acquirees being significantly integrated into the Company's cost structure shortly after the closing of the acquisitions.\nF-25\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n7.     \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n    \nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n    \n    \nThe following table provides a summary of the recognized assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nBasis of Fair Value Measurements\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nDecember 31, 2024\nAssets:\n \n \n \n \nDeferred compensation trading securities\n$\n72\n \n$\n72\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nCash surrender value of life insurance policies\n64\n \n—\n \n64\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n136\n \n$\n72\n \n$\n64\n \n$\n—\n \nLiabilities:\n \n \n \n \nDeferred compensation liabilities\n$\n140\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n140\n \n$\n—\n \nContingent consideration\n106\n \n—\n \n—\n \n106\n \nFixed-to-variable interest rate swaps\n34\n \n—\n \n34\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n280\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n174\n \n$\n106\n \nRedeemable noncontrolling interest\n$\n83\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n— \n$\n83\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets:\n \n \n \n \nDeferred compensation trading securities\n$\n70\n \n$\n70\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nCash surrender value of life insurance policies\n55\n \n—\n \n55\n \n—\n \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \nTotal\n$\n127\n \n$\n70\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n2\n \nLiabilities:\n \n \n \n \nDeferred compensation liabilities\n$\n131\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n131\n \n$\n—\n \nContingent consideration\n104\n \n—\n \n—\n \n104\n \nTotal\n$\n235\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n131\n \n$\n104\n \nRedeemable noncontrolling interest\n$\n76\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n— \n$\n76\n \n    \n    The Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are invested in a variety of participant-directed stock and bond mutual funds that are classified as trading securities.  The trading securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the changes in the fair value of these securities, which are recorded in other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheet, are measured using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, exclusive of any transaction costs.  A corresponding adjustment for changes in fair value of the trading securities is also reflected in the changes in fair value of the deferred compensation obligation.  The deferred compensation liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the trading securities.\n    The Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation program.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are “invested” at the direction of the employee in a hypothetical portfolio of investments which are tracked by an administrator.  The Company purchases life insurance policies, with the Company named as beneficiary of the policies, for the purpose of funding the program's liability.  Changes in the cash \nF-26\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \nsurrender value of the life insurance policies are based upon earnings and changes in the value of the underlying investments.  Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation obligation are derived using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units.  The cash surrender value, which is recorded in other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheet, and the deferred compensation obligation are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the hypothetical investments. Deferrals under the plan currently may only be made by participants who made deferrals under the plan in 2017. \n    The Company's available-for-sale debt securities are measured at fair value using discounted cash flows.  These fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is based on significant inputs that are not observable.  Significant inputs include cash flows projections and a discount rate.  The investments are recorded in other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\n    The fair value measurements of the Company's fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, are model-derived valuations as of a given date in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets including certain financial information and certain assumptions regarding past, present and future market conditions.\n    \n    In connection with the acquisition of Haystack (see Note 6 for further discussion), there is a contingent consideration obligation under which the seller can receive up to $\n100\n million of additional consideration dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks through 2028 and up to an additional $\n50\n million of consideration dependent upon the Company receiving reimbursement coverage from the CMS.  The portion of the contingent consideration obligation which is dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks was measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo method and is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined based on significant inputs that are not observable. Significant inputs include management’s estimate of revenue and other market inputs, including comparable company revenue volatility (\n35\n%) and a discount rate (\n10.5\n%).  The portion of the contingent consideration obligation which is dependent upon the Company receiving reimbursement coverage from the CMS is also classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is principally determined based on management's estimate, which is a significant input that is not observable.  Additionally, the fair value of the entire contingent consideration obligation is also impacted by a market discount rate (\n5\n%) which adjusts the estimated payments to present value.  The fair value of the contingent consideration obligation is not overly sensitive to movements in the comparable company revenue volatility or the discount rate used for the portion of the obligation that is dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks.  For example, changing the comparable company revenue volatility from \n35\n% to \n25\n% impacts the fair value by $\n5\n million (assuming no other inputs are modified) and changing the discount rate from \n10.5\n% to \n7.0\n% impacts the fair value by $\n3\n million (assuming no other inputs are modified).\n    The Company has additional contingent consideration obligations in connection with other acquisitions.  The liabilities related to such obligations are included in the amounts below.   \n    \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of liabilities using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\nContingent Consideration\nBalance, December 31, 2022\n$\n23\n \nPurchases, additions and issuances\n88\n \nSettlements\n(\n18\n)\nTotal fair value adjustments included in earnings - unrealized\n11\n \nBalance, December 31, 2023\n104\n \nPurchases, additions and issuances\n6\n \nSettlements\n(\n6\n)\nTotal fair value adjustments included in earnings - unrealized\n2\n \nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n106\n \n    The $\n2\n million and $\n11\n million of net losses included in earnings associated with the changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are reported in other operating expense, net.  The year-over-year decrease in the net losses was principally due to changes in the timing of estimated revenues for Haystack.\nF-27\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    Of the aggregate $\n106\n million contingent consideration obligation as of December 31, 2024, $\n101\n million and $\n5\n million were included in other liabilities and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  Of the aggregate $\n104\n million contingent consideration obligation as of December 31, 2023, $\n99\n million and $\n5\n million were included in other liabilities and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\n    \n    In connection with the sale of an \n18.9\n% noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to UMass Memorial Medical Center (\"UMass\") on July 1, 2015, the Company granted UMass the right to require the Company to purchase all of its interest in the subsidiary at fair value commencing July 1, 2020.  As of December 31, 2024, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was presented at its fair value.  The fair value measurement of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that takes into account, among other items, the joint venture's expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and a discount rate commensurate with economic risk.\n    During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $\n29\n million impairment charge on certain long-lived assets related to the shutdown of a business and, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $\n14\n million impairment charge on certain property, plant and equipment.  The fair value measurements were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as they were based on significant inputs that are not observable, including cash flow projections.\n    \n    The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short maturities of these instruments.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated at $\n6.1\n billion and $\n4.6\n billion, respectively.  Principally all of the Company's debt is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value of the debt is estimated based on rates currently offered to the Company with identical terms and maturities, using quoted active market prices and yields, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.\n8.    \nTAXES ON INCOME\n    The Company's pre-tax income before equity in earnings of equity method investees consisted of approximately $\n1.1\n billion, $\n1.1\n billion and $\n1.2\n billion from U.S. operations and pre-tax income of $\n28\n million, $\n7\n million and $\n2\n million from foreign operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.     \n        \n    \nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows: \n2024\n2023\n2022\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n204\n \n$\n235\n \n$\n200\n \nState and local\n52\n \n59\n \n62\n \nForeign\n4\n \n3\n \n1\n \nDeferred:\nFederal\n4\n \n(\n38\n)\n29\n \nState and local\n2\n \n(\n10\n)\n(\n27\n)\nForeign\n7\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nTotal\n$\n273\n \n$\n248\n \n$\n264\n \nF-28\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: \n2024\n2023\n2022\nTax provision at statutory rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nState and local income taxes, net of federal benefit\n4.5\n \n4.6\n \n4.7\n \nImpact of noncontrolling interests\n(\n1.1\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n1.4\n)\nAdjustment to state deferred tax liabilities\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1.5\n)\nExcess tax benefits on stock-based compensation arrangements\n(\n0.7\n)\n(\n1.0\n)\n(\n1.1\n)\nReturn to provision true-ups \n(\n1.0\n)\n(\n1.8\n)\n(\n1.1\n)\nImpact of equity earnings\n0.3\n \n0.5\n \n0.7\n \nChanges in reserves for uncertain tax positions\n0.8\n \n0.9\n \n0.7\n \nIncome tax credits\n(\n1.7\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n0.9\n)\nOther, net\n1.1\n \n0.2\n \n0.3\n \nEffective tax rate\n23.2\n \n%\n22.0\n \n%\n21.4\n \n%\n    \nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: \n2024\n2023\nNon-current deferred tax assets (liabilities):\nAccounts receivable reserves\n$\n15\n \n$\n17\n \nLiabilities not currently deductible\n170\n \n163\n \nStock-based compensation\n35\n \n33\n \nBasis differences in investments, joint ventures and subsidiaries \n(\n4\n)\n(\n7\n)\nTax attribute carryforwards, net of valuation allowances and unrecognized tax position liabilities\n60\n \n48\n \nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n(\n146\n)\n(\n149\n)\nOperating lease liabilities\n161\n \n162\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n(\n541\n)\n(\n537\n)\nTotal non-current deferred tax liabilities, net\n$\n(\n250\n)\n$\n(\n270\n)\n    \n    As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, non-current deferred tax liabilities of $\n278\n million and $\n270\n million, respectively, are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

Prepaid income taxes were $\n47\n million and $\n48\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. \nF-29\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n90\n \n$\n94\n \n$\n110\n \nAdditions:\nFor tax positions of current year\n2\n \n1\n \n1\n \nFor tax positions of prior years\n9\n \n15\n \n18\n \nReductions:\nChanges in judgment\n—\n \n(\n6\n)\n(\n7\n)\nExpirations of statutes of limitations\n(\n5\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\nSettlements\n—\n \n(\n10\n)\n(\n24\n)\nOther:\nForeign deferred tax assets reduction\n28\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBalance, end of year\n$\n124\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n94\n \n    The contingent liabilities for tax positions primarily relate to uncertainties associated with the realization of tax benefits derived from the allocation of income and expense among state jurisdictions, the characterization and timing of certain tax deductions associated with business combinations, certain tax credits and the deductibility of certain expenses and settlement payments.   \n    The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is $\n104\n million.  Based upon the expiration of statutes of limitations, settlements and/or the conclusion of tax examinations, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $\n9\n million within the next twelve months.\n    Accruals for interest expense on contingent tax liabilities are classified in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.  Accruals for penalties have historically been immaterial.  Interest expense included in income tax expense in each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $\n7\n million, $\n5\n million and $\n3\n million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had approximately $\n24\n million and $\n17\n million, respectively, accrued, net of the benefit of a federal and state deduction, for the payment of interest on uncertain tax positions.  \n    The recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits includes estimates and judgment by management and inherently involves subjectivity.  Changes in estimates may create volatility in the Company's effective tax rate in future periods and may be due to settlements with various tax authorities (either favorable or unfavorable), the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax positions and obtaining new information about particular tax positions that may cause management to change its estimates.\n    In the regular course of business, various federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities conduct examinations of the Company's income tax filings and the Company generally remains subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective jurisdiction.  The Internal Revenue Service has either completed its examinations of the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns or the statute of limitations has expired up through and including the 2020 tax year.  At this time, the Company does not believe that there will be any material additional payments beyond its recorded contingent liability reserves that may be required as a result of these tax audits.  As of December 31, 2024, a summary of the tax years that remain subject to examination, awaiting approval, are under appeal, or are otherwise unresolved for the Company's major jurisdictions are:\n    \n    United States - federal        2021 - 2023 \n    United States - various states    2011 - 2023\n \nF-30\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n9.    \nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW AND OTHER DATA \n    \nSupplemental cash flow and other data for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\n    \n2024\n2023\n2022\nDepreciation expense\n$\n366\n \n$\n331\n \n$\n317\n \nAmortization expense\n127\n \n108\n \n120\n \nDepreciation and amortization expense\n$\n493\n \n$\n439\n \n$\n437\n \nInterest expense\n$\n(\n226\n)\n$\n(\n163\n)\n$\n(\n148\n)\nInterest income\n25\n \n11\n \n10\n \nInterest expense, net\n$\n(\n201\n)\n$\n(\n152\n)\n$\n(\n138\n)\nInterest paid\n$\n262\n \n$\n134\n \n$\n156\n \nIncome taxes paid\n$\n256\n \n$\n317\n \n$\n283\n \nAccounts payable associated with capital expenditures\n$\n60\n \n$\n42\n \n$\n38\n \nAccounts payable associated with purchases of treasury stock\n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \nDividend payable\n$\n84\n \n$\n79\n \n$\n74\n \nDividends received from equity method investees\n$\n33\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n61\n \nBusinesses acquired:\n \n \nFair value of assets acquired\n$\n2,397\n \n$\n734\n \n$\n182\n \nFair value of liabilities assumed\n183\n \n34\n \n16\n \nFair value of net assets acquired\n2,214\n \n700\n \n166\n \nMerger consideration payable\n—\n \n(\n88\n)\n(\n18\n)\nCash paid for business acquisitions\n2,214\n \n612\n \n148\n \nLess: Cash acquired\n50\n \n1\n \n4\n \nBusiness acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n$\n2,164\n \n$\n611\n \n$\n144\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nLeases:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n$\n201\n \n$\n192\n \n$\n185\n \nOperating cash flows from finance leases\n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \nFinancing cash flows from finance leases\n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \nLeased assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities\n$\n154\n \n$\n181\n \n$\n154\n \n    During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, costs associated with donations, contributions, and other financial support through Quest for Health Equity, the Company's initiative with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation to reduce health disparities in underserved communities, were $\n0 million\n, $\n0 million\n and $\n93\n million, respectively.

Through August 2024, the facility included a $\n75\n million uncommitted accordion which, at such time, the Company utilized in order to expand its total capacity under the facility to $\n600\n million.  During November 2024, the Company amended the facility to extend the maturity to November 2026.  Additionally, the amended facility includes a $\n200\n million uncommitted accordion which, if utilized, brings the total capacity under the facility to $\n800\n million.  The entire facility can be used for borrowings.  Additionally, the Company can choose to utilize up to $\n150\n million of such capacity to issue letters of credit (see Note 18).  Issued letters of credit reduce the available borrowing capacity under the facility.  Interest on borrowings under the facility is based on either commercial paper rates for highly-rated issuers or the adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"Term SOFR\"), plus a spread of \n0.80\n%.  Borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility are collateralized by certain domestic receivables.  The Secured Receivables Credit Facility is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants and \nF-34\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \ncertain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were \nno\n outstanding borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility.\n    \nSenior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\n    The Company is party to a $\n750\n million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility” or \"Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\") which matures in November 2026.  Under the Credit Facility, the Company can issue letters of credit totaling $\n150\n million (see Note 18).  Issued letters of credit reduce the available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.  Additionally, the Credit Facility includes an additional $\n500\n million uncommitted accordion which, if utilized, brings the total capacity under the facility to $\n1.3\n billion.  Interest on the Credit Facility is based on certain published rates plus an applicable margin based on changes in the Company's public debt ratings.  At the option of the Company, it may elect to lock into Term SOFR-based interest rate contracts for periods up to six months. For interest on any U.S. Dollar-denominated outstanding amounts not covered under Term SOFR-based interest rate contracts, the Company can opt for an alternate base rate, which is calculated by reference to the prime rate, the federal funds rate or an adjusted Term SOFR rate. The Company also has the option to borrow in other currencies. As of December 31, 2024 , the Company's borrowing rate for Term SOFR-based loans under the Credit Facility was adjusted Term SOFR plus \n1.00\n%. The Credit Facility contains various covenants, including the maintenance of a financial leverage ratio, which could impact the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness.\n As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were\n \nno\n outstanding borrowings\n \nun\nder the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.\n    \nIssuance of Senior Notes\n    In August 2024, the Company completed a $\n1.85\n billion senior notes offering, consisting of $\n400\n million aggregate principal amount of \n4.60\n% senior notes due December 2027 (the \"2027 Senior Notes\"), $\n600\n million aggregate principal amount of \n4.625\n% senior notes due December 2029 (the \"2029 Senior Notes\") and $\n850\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.00\n% senior notes due December 2034 (the \"2034 Senior Notes,\" and together with the 2027 Senior Notes and the 2029 Senior Notes, the \"Senior Notes\").  The Senior Notes were issued at an aggregate original issue discount of $\n4\n million.  The Company incurred $\n15\n million of debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the Senior Notes, which are included as a reduction of the carrying amount of the Senior Notes and which are being amortized over the terms of the related Senior Notes.\n    The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to fund the purchase price and related transaction costs of the acquisition of LifeLabs (see Note 6).  The Company expects to use the balance of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption or repayment of indebtedness, including the Company's \n3.50\n% senior notes due March 2025.\n    \nRepayment of Senior Notes\n    During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repaid in full the outstanding indebtedness under the Company's $\n300\n million of \n4.25\n% senior notes which matured on April 1, 2024.\n    \n3.50% Senior Notes due March 2025\n    The Company has $\n600\n million of \n3.50\n% senior notes due March 2025.  The senior notes are included in current portion of long-term debt in the Company's December 31, 2024 consolidated balance sheet.  Such notes were included in long-term debt in the Company's December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet.  \n    \n    All of the senior notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with the Company's other senior unsecured obligations.  None of the Company's senior notes have a sinking fund requirement.\n    The Company may redeem its outstanding senior notes prior to scheduled maturity, as a whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, except for certain notes for which the Company also has an option to redeem such instruments at par value on or after dates specified in the indentures governing the notes (\"the par value redemption option\").  For notes with the par value redemption option, if such notes are redeemed prior to the specified dates, the redemption price calculations exclude any interest that would have been due after such dates.\nF-35\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n            \n    \nMaturities of Long-Term Debt\n    \n    \nAs of December 31, 2024, long-term debt matures as follows:\nYear Ending December 31,\n2025\n$\n601\n \n2026\n501\n \n2027\n401\n \n2028\n1\n \n2029\n1,101\n \nThereafter\n3,687\n \nTotal maturities of long-term debt\n6,292\n \nUnamortized discount\n(\n11\n)\nDebt issuance costs\n(\n35\n)\nFair value basis adjustments attributable to hedged debt\n(\n29\n)\nTotal long-term debt\n6,217\n \nLess: Current portion of long-term debt\n602\n \nTotal long-term debt, net of current portion\n$\n5,615\n \nF-36\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n14.     \nLEASES\n    \n    \nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company leases office space, patient service centers, clinical laboratories, warehouses, logistic hubs and equipment primarily through operating leases, with a limited number of finance leases. A \nright-of-use asset\n, representing the underlying asset during the lease term, and a lease \nliability\n, representing the payment obligation arising from the lease, are recognized on the balance sheet at lease commencement based on the present value of the payment obligation. For operating leases, expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, interest expense on the lease \nliability\n is recognized using the effective interest method and amortization of the right-of-use asset is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.  Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, lease expense associated with short-term leases was not material.\n    The Company primarily uses its collateralized incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments as the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate.  Such incremental borrowing rates, which take into account interest rates offered to companies that have similar credit ratings to the Company, are determined using a portfolio approach which groups the Company’s leases based on tenor.\n    The Company has lease agreements with (i) right-of-use asset payments and (ii) non-lease components (i.e., payments related to maintenance fees, utilities, etc.) which have been combined and accounted for as a single lease component. \n    The Company's leases have remaining terms of less than \n1\n year to \n14\n years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to approximately \n20\n years. The Company's lease terms may include renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised and termination options that are reasonably certain not to be exercised. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property.\n    Certain of the Company's lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation or a market rate which are included in the lease liabilities.\n    \nThe Company's assets and liabilities for its lease agreements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nLeases\nBalance Sheet Classification\n2024\n2023\nAssets\nOperating\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n$\n651\n \n$\n602\n \nFinance\nProperty, plant and equipment, net (a)\n17\n \n6\n \nTotal lease assets\n$\n668\n \n$\n608\n \nLiabilities\nCurrent:\nOperating\nCurrent portion of long-term operating lease liabilities\n$\n173\n \n$\n153\n \nFinance\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n1\n \n1\n \nNon-current:\nOperating\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n535\n \n503\n \nFinance\nLong-term debt\n16\n \n6\n \nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n725\n \n$\n663\n \n(a) Finance lease assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were recorded net of accumulated amortization of $\n1\n million and $\n5\n million, respectively.\nF-37\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \n    \nComponents of lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nLease cost\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating lease cost (a)\n$\n402\n \n$\n353\n \n$\n345\n \nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of leased assets\n1\n \n2\n2\n \nInterest on lease liabilities\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \nNet lease cost\n$\n404\n \n$\n355\n \n$\n348\n \n(a) Includes short-term leases and variable lease costs (primarily usage-based maintenance fees and utilities related to real estate leases and certain equipment-related and vehicle-related costs) of $\n204\n million, $\n161\n million and $\n160\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n    \n    \nThe maturity of the Company's lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024 is as follows:\nMaturity of lease liabilities\nOperating leases\nFinance leases\nTotal\n2025\n$\n194\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n196\n \n2026\n170\n \n2\n \n172\n \n2027\n139\n \n2\n \n141\n \n2028\n105\n \n2\n \n107\n \n2029\n66\n \n2\n \n68\n \nThereafter\n120\n \n17\n \n137\n \nTotal lease payments\n794\n \n27\n \n821\n \nLess: Interest \n86\n \n10\n \n96\n \nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$\n708\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n725\n \n    \n    \nLease term and discount rate as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nLease term and discount rate\n2024\n2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years):\nOperating leases\n5\n6\nFinance leases\n13\n5\nWeighted-average discount rate:\nOperating leases\n4.4\n \n%\n4.0\n \n%\nFinance leases\n6.9\n \n%\n2.4\n \n%\n    The Company's discount rates for its operating leases were primarily determined using the Company's incremental borrowing rate.  \n    See Note 9 for cash flow information on cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities and leased assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nF-38\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n15.    \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n    \n    Interest Rate Derivatives – Cash Flow Hedges\n    \n    From time to time, the Company has entered into various interest rate lock agreements and forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge part of the Company's interest rate exposure associated with the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates. \n    During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with several financial institutions for a total notional amount of $\n500\n million, which were accounted for as cash flow hedges.  The agreements were entered into in order to hedge a portion of the Company's interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates over a \nten-year\n period related to an anticipated issuance of debt.  In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes (see Note 13), these agreements were settled and the Company received $\n3\n million.

The ELTIP provides for the grant to eligible employees of either non-qualified or incentive stock options, or both, to purchase shares of Company common stock at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Grants of stock appreciation rights allow eligible employees to receive a payment based on the appreciation of Company common stock in cash, shares of Company common stock or a combination thereof.  The stock appreciation rights are granted at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the ELTIP expire on the date designated by the Board of Directors but in no event more than \nten years\n from date of grant.  No stock appreciation rights have been granted under the ELTIP.  Under the ELTIP, awards are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the end of the vesting period prescribed by the Board of Directors.  For all award types, the vesting period is generally over \nthree years\n from the date of grant.  For performance share units, the actual amount of shares earned is based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards.  The performance goals for awards granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024 were based on the financial performance of the Company, as well as relative TSR.  The maximum number of shares of Company common stock in respect of which awards may be granted under the ELTIP is approximately \n87\n million shares.  \n    The DLTIP provides for the grant to non-employee directors of non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Company common stock at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  The DLTIP also permits awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units to non-employee directors.  Stock options granted under the DLTIP expire on the date designated by the Board of Directors but in no event more than \nten years\n from date of grant.  For all award types, the vesting period is generally over \nthree years\n from the date of grant, regardless of whether the award recipient remains a director of the Company.  The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the DLTIP is \n2.4\n million shares.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, grants under the DLTIP totaled \n13\n thousand shares, \n12\n thousand shares and \n10\n thousand shares, respectively. \n    The Company's practice is to issue shares related to its ESPP and stock-based compensation program solely from common stock held in treasury.  See Note 16 for further information regarding the Company's share repurchase program.\n    The fair value of each stock option award granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-valuation model.  The expected volatility under the Black-Scholes option-valuation model was based on historical volatilities of the Company's common stock.  The dividend yield was based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant.  The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the expected holding period of the related award.  \nF-42\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \nThe expected holding period was estimated using the historical stock option exercise behavior of employees.

This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock.  Total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n43\n million, $\n42\n million and $\n70\n million, respectively. \n    \n    As of December 31, 2024, there was $\n5\n million of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to nonvested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.6\n years.\n    The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is the average market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant.  For performance share units with a goal based on the financial performance of the Company, the fair value is based on the average market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company's common stock during the vesting period.  For performance share units with a market-based relative TSR goal, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.  The expected volatility under the Monte Carlo valuation model is based on the historical volatility of the common stock of the Company and the common stock of the companies in the peer index.  The dividend yield is based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the performance period of the related award. \nF-43\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \n    \nThe weighted average assumptions used in valuing performance share units with a market-based relative TSR goal in the periods presented were:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nFair value at grant date\n$\n130.17\n$\n171.58\n$\n130.00\nExpected volatility\n21.3\n%\n25.0\n%\n29.9\n%\nDividend yield\n2.4\n%\n2.0\n%\n2.0\n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.4\n%\n4.4\n%\n1.7\n%\n    \nThe following summarizes the activity related to stock awards, including restricted stock units and performance share units, for 2024, 2023 and 2022: \n2024\n2023\n2022\nShares\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nShares\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nShares\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nShares outstanding, beginning of year\n1.2\n \n$\n130.70\n \n1.1\n \n$\n122.45\n \n1.0\n \n$\n107.46\n \nShares granted\n0.6\n \n128.00\n \n0.6\n \n141.77\n \n0.8\n \n128.49\n \nShares vested\n(\n0.5\n)\n124.59\n \n(\n0.5\n)\n112.28\n \n(\n0.6\n)\n92.45\n \nShares forfeited and canceled\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.1\n)\n122.38\n \nShares outstanding, end of year\n1.3\n \n$\n130.02\n \n1.2\n \n$\n130.70\n \n1.1\n \n$\n122.45\n \n    As of December 31, 2024, there was $\n38\n million of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to nonvested stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.6\n years.

The maximum Company matching contribution is \n5\n% of eligible employee compensation.  The Company's expense for contributions to its defined contribution plans aggregated $\n99\n million, $\n96\n million and $\n95\n million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nF-44\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \nSupplemental Deferred Compensation Plans\n    The Company has a supplemental deferred compensation plan that is an unfunded, non-qualified plan that provides for certain management and highly compensated employees to defer up to \n50\n% of their salary in excess of their defined contribution plan limits and for certain eligible employees, up to \n95\n% of their variable incentive compensation.  The maximum Company matching contribution is \n5\n% of eligible employee compensation.  The compensation deferred under this plan, together with Company matching amounts, are credited with earnings or losses measured by the mirrored rate of return on investments elected by plan participants.  Each plan participant is fully vested in all deferred compensation, Company match and earnings credited to their account.  The amounts accrued under the Company's deferred compensation plans were $\n72\n million and $\n70\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Although the Company is currently contributing all participant deferrals and matching amounts to a trust, the funds in this trust, totaling $\n72\n million and $\n70\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are general assets of the Company and are subject to any claims of the Company's creditors. \n    The Company also offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation program.  The Company matches employee contributions equal to \n25\n%, up to a maximum of \nfive thousand\n dollars per plan year.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are “invested” at the direction of the employee in a hypothetical portfolio of investments which are tracked by an administrator.  Each participant is fully vested in their deferred compensation and vests in Company matching contributions over a period of \nfour years\n at \n25\n% per year.  This plan was amended effective January 1, 2018 so that future deferrals under the plan may only be made by participants who made deferrals under the plan in 2017.  The amounts accrued under this plan were $\n68\n million and $\n61\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The Company purchases life insurance policies, with the Company named as beneficiary of the policies, for the purpose of funding the program's liability.  The cash surrender value of such life insurance policies was $\n64\n million and $\n55\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n      For each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company's expense for matching contributions to these plans was not material.\n18.     \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n    \nLetters of Credit and Contractual Obligations\n    \n    The Company can issue letters of credit under its Secured Receivables Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (see Note 13).  In support of its risk management program, to ensure the Company’s performance or payment to third parties, $\n73\n million in letters of credit under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility were outstanding as of December 31, 2024.  The letters of credit primarily represent collateral for current and future automobile liability and workers’ compensation loss payments.\n    The Company has certain noncancelable commitments, primarily under take-or-pay arrangements, to purchase products or services from various suppliers, mainly for consulting and other service agreements, and standing orders to purchase reagents and other laboratory supplies.  As of December 31, 2024, the approximate total future purchase commitments are $\n693\n million, of which $\n231\n million are expected to be incurred in 2025, $\n345\n million are expected to be incurred in 2026 through 2027 and the balance thereafter.  During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, $\n263\n million, $\n222\n million and $\n83\n million, respectively, were purchased under noncancelable commitments.\n    \nBilling and Collection Agreement\n    In September 2016, the Company entered into a \nten-year\n agreement with a third party to outsource its billing and  related operations for the majority of the Company’s revenues.  Services under the agreement commenced during the fourth quarter of 2016.  The agreement includes an annual fee, which is subject to adjustment based on certain changes in the Company's requisition volume and the achievement of various performance metrics.\n    \n    \nContingent Lease Obligations\n    The Company remains subject to contingent obligations under certain real estate leases, including real estate leases that were entered into by certain predecessor companies of a subsidiary prior to the Company's acquisition of the subsidiary.  \nF-45\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \nWhile over the course of many years, the title to certain properties and interest in the subject leases have been transferred to third parties and the subject leases have been amended several times by such third parties, the lessors have not formally released the subsidiary predecessor companies from their original obligations under the leases and therefore remain contingently liable in the event of default.  The remaining terms of the lease obligations and the Company's corresponding indemnifications range up to \n23\n years.  The lease payments under certain leases are subject to market value adjustments and contingent rental payments and therefore, the total contingent obligations under the leases cannot be precisely determined but are likely to total several hundred million dollars.  A claim against the Company would be made only upon the current lessee's default and, in certain cases, after a series of claims and corresponding defaults by third parties that precede the Company in the order of liability.  The Company also has certain indemnification rights from other parties to recover losses in the event of default on the lease obligations.  The Company believes that the likelihood of its performance under these contingent obligations is remote and no liability has been recorded for any potential payments under the contingent lease obligations.\n    \nCertain Legal Matters\n    The Company may incur losses associated with these proceedings and investigations, but it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss, if any, that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, or other resolution of these proceedings and investigations based on the stage of these proceedings and investigations, the absence of specific allegations as to alleged damages, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, if applicable, and/or the lack of resolution of significant factual and legal issues.  The Company has insurance coverage rights in place (limited in amount; subject to deductible) for certain potential costs and liabilities related to these proceedings and investigations.\n    \n    In 2020, \ntwo\n putative class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey against the Company and other defendants with respect to the Company’s 401(k) plan. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the fiduciaries of the 401(k) plan breached their duties by failing to disclose the expenses and risks of plan investment options, allowing unreasonable administration expenses to be charged to plan participants, and selecting and retaining high cost and poor performing investments.  In October 2020, the court consolidated the \ntwo\n lawsuits under the caption \nIn re: Quest Diagnostics ERISA Litigation\n and plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint.  In May 2021, the court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint.  After discovery was completed, the Company's filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted.  The matter is on appeal.\n    On June 3, 2019, the Company reported that Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc./American Medical Collection Agency (“AMCA”) had informed the Company and Optum360 LLC that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA’s system between August 1, 2018 and March 30, 2019 (the “AMCA Data Security Incident”).  Optum360 provides revenue management services to the Company, and AMCA provided debt collection services to Optum360.  AMCA first informed the Company of the AMCA Data Security Incident on May 14, 2019.  AMCA’s affected system included financial information (e.g., credit card numbers and bank account information), medical information and other personal information (e.g., social security numbers). Test results were not included.  Neither Optum360’s nor the Company’s systems or databases were involved in the incident. AMCA also informed the Company that information pertaining to other laboratories’ customers was also affected.  Following announcement of the AMCA Data Security Incident, AMCA sought protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.  The bankruptcy proceeding has been dismissed.\n    Numerous putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company related to the AMCA Data Security Incident.  The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the cases that were then still pending to, and consolidated them for pre-trial proceedings in, the U.S. District Court for New Jersey.  In November 2019, the plaintiffs in the multidistrict proceeding filed a consolidated putative class action complaint against the Company and Optum360 that named additional individuals as plaintiffs and that asserted a variety of common law and statutory claims in connection with the AMCA Data Security Incident.  In January 2020, the Company moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint; the motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part.  Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the Company also moved to dismiss. The motion was granted in part and denied in part.  Discovery is proceeding.\n    In addition, a group of state attorney general offices are investigating the Company in connection with the AMCA Data Security Incident.  The Company is cooperating with the investigation.  \nF-46\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    The Company is subject to a putative class action entitled \nCole, et al. v Quest Diagnostics Incorporated\n, which was filed in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, for allegedly conspiring with Facebook to track customers’ internet communications on Company web platforms without authorization, in violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (\"CIPA\") and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (\"CMIA\")\n.\n  The complaint alleged that the Company’s actions were an invasion of privacy and contributed to a loss of value in plaintiffs’ personally identifiable information.  The Company moved to dismiss the case or, in the alternative, transfer venue to the U.S. District Court for New Jersey.  Subsequently, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the Company also moved to dismiss.  The Company's motion to transfer the case was granted.  The Company refiled its motion to dismiss with the New Jersey District Court.  The motion to dismiss was granted without prejudice as to the CMIA claim and denied as to the CIPA claim.  Thereafter, the Company filed a motion for reconsideration as to the CIPA claim, which was granted.\n    As previously disclosed, in August 2011, the Company had received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia seeking various business records, including records related to the Company's compliance program, certain marketing materials, certain product offerings, and certain test ordering and other policies. The Company cooperated with the request. In 2021, a third amended complaint in a qui tam action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia was unsealed, which is related to the matter underlying the August 2011 subpoena. Both the U.S. Department of Justice and the State of Georgia declined to intervene in the action. The Company moved to dismiss the complaint and the complaint was dismissed without prejudice in August 2022.  The relator subsequently filed a fourth amended complaint, which the Company has moved to dismiss.  On August 23, 2024, the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  The matter is on appeal.\n    The Company also received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.  The subpoenas seek various records relating to the Company’s relationship with the New York Giants and adherence to certain company policies and federal laws.  The Company is cooperating with the investigation. \n    The Company has also received subpoenas from the New York Attorney General’s Office that seek information about, among other things, the ordering and billing of certain test panels to Medicaid programs in New York.  The Company is cooperating with the investigation.\n    Other Legal Matters\n    In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with the Company's activities as a provider of diagnostic testing, information and services.  These actions could involve claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages, and could have an adverse impact on the Company's client base and reputation.\n    The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings by governmental agencies regarding the Company's business which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. \n    The federal or state governments may bring claims based on the Company's current practices, which it believes are lawful.  In addition, certain federal and state statutes, including the\n qui tam\n provisions of the federal False Claims Act, allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers.  The Company is aware of lawsuits, and from time to time has received subpoenas, related to billing or other practices based on the False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes, regulations or other laws.  The Company understands that there may be other pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other \"whistleblowers\" as to which the Company cannot determine the extent of any potential liability.\nF-47\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    Management cannot predict the outcome of such matters.  Although management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, given the high degree of judgment involved in establishing loss estimates related to these types of matters, the outcome of such matters may be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid.\n    These matters are in different stages.  Some of these matters are in their early stages.  Matters may involve responding to and cooperating with various government investigations and related subpoenas.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company does not believe that material losses related to legal matters are probable.\n    \n    Reserves for legal matters totaled $\n4\n million and $\n6\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n    \nReserves for General and Professional Liability Claims\n    \n    As a general matter, providers of clinical testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims.  These suits could involve claims for substantial damages.  Any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on the Company's client base and reputation.  The Company maintains various liability insurance coverages for, among other things, claims that could result from providing, or failing to provide, clinical testing services, including inaccurate testing results, and other exposures.  The Company's insurance coverage limits its maximum exposure on individual claims; however, the Company is essentially self-insured for a significant portion of these claims.  \n    The Company is subject to a series of individual claims brought by persons in Ireland related to allegations stemming from pap smear screening services performed by the Company.  In general, claimants have alleged that the results of certain pap smear screening tests performed by the Company and other providers, pursuant to a program coordinated by the Irish government, were incorrect for individuals who were later diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The Irish government and an independent scoping inquiry commissioned by the Irish government found that the Company’s performance of its screening services for the Irish cervical cancer screening program were in accordance with both Ireland’s requirements and international standards.  The Company has settled claims made by certain individuals, is a party in multiple lawsuits and may be served as a party in additional lawsuits.  The Company does not believe that the resolution of existing or future claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity, but the ultimate outcomes of these claims are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\n    Reserves for general and professional liabilities claims matters, including those associated with both asserted and incurred but not reported claims, are established on an undiscounted basis by considering actuarially determined losses based upon the Company's historical and projected loss experience.  Such reserves totaled $\n169\n million and $\n173\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n    While the basis for claims reserves is actuarially determined losses based upon the Company's historical and projected loss experience, the process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to these types of claims involves a high degree of judgment.  Although the Company believes that its present reserves and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, it is possible that the Company may incur liabilities in excess of its recorded reserves or insurance coverage.  Changes in the facts and circumstances associated with claims could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations (principally costs of services), cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are adjusted or paid.\n \n19.    \nBUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\n    The Company's DIS business is the only reportable segment based on the manner in which the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's CODM, assesses performance and allocates resources across the organization. The CODM uses the reported measure of segment profit (or loss) in assessing segment performance versus budget and when deciding how to allocate resources to segments. The DIS business provides diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers within its primary customer channels - physicians, hospitals, and patients and consumers.  The DIS business accounted for greater than \n95\n% of net revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nF-48\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    \nAll other operating segments include the Company's DS businesses, which consist of its risk assessment services and healthcare information technology businesses.  The Company's DS businesses offer solutions for insurers and offer solutions for healthcare providers and payers. \n    \n    As of December 31, 2024, substantially all of the Company’s services were provided within the United States and substantially all of the Company’s assets were located within the United States.  On August 23, 2024, the Company acquired LifeLabs, which provides laboratory diagnostic information and digital health connectivity systems in Canada.  See Note 6 for further discussion. \n    \nThe following table is a summary of segment information for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Segment asset information is not presented since it is not received by the CODM at the operating segment level.  The CODM regularly reviews certain consolidated expenses, including employee compensation costs.  \"Other segment items\" principally consist of costs for obtaining, transporting and testing specimens, facility costs used for the delivery of the Company's services, costs associated with the Company's sales and marketing efforts, and costs related to billing operations. Operating income (loss) of each segment represents net revenues less directly identifiable expenses.   General corporate activities included in the table below are comprised of general management and administrative corporate expenses, amortization and impairment of intangibles assets and other operating income and expenses, net of certain general corporate activity costs that are allocated to the DIS and DS businesses.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those of the Company as set forth in Note 2.\n2024\nDIS\nTotal\nNet revenues\n$\n9,614\n \n$\n9,614\n \nDS revenues\n258\n \nTotal net revenues\n$\n9,872\n \nLess: Other segment items\n(\n7,984\n)\nSegment operating income\n$\n1,630\n \n$\n1,630\n \nDS operating income\n33\n \nGeneral corporate activities\n(\n317\n)\nTotal operating income\n1,346\n \nNon-operating expense, net\n(\n171\n)\nIncome before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees\n1,175\n \nIncome tax expense\n(\n273\n)\nEquity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes\n19\n \nNet income\n921\n \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n50\n \nNet income attributable to Quest Diagnostics\n$\n871\n \nF-49\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n2023\nDIS\nTotal\nNet revenues\n$\n8,976\n \n$\n8,976\n \nDS revenues\n276\n \nTotal net revenues\n$\n9,252\n \nLess: Other segment items\n(\n7,429\n)\nSegment operating income\n$\n1,547\n \n$\n1,547\n \nDS operating income\n34\n \nGeneral corporate activities\n(\n319\n)\nTotal operating income\n1,262\n \nNon-operating expense, net\n(\n132\n)\nIncome before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees\n1,130\n \nIncome tax expense\n(\n248\n)\nEquity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes\n26\n \nNet income\n908\n \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n54\n \nNet income attributable to Quest Diagnostics\n$\n854\n \n2022\nDIS\nTotal\nNet revenues\n$\n9,609\n \n$\n9,609\n \nDS revenues\n274\n \nTotal net revenues\n$\n9,883\n \nLess: Other segment items\n(\n7,905\n)\nSegment operating income\n$\n1,704\n \n$\n1,704\n \nDS operating income\n20\n \nGeneral corporate activities\n(\n296\n)\nTotal operating income\n1,428\n \nNon-operating expense, net\n(\n193\n)\nIncome before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees\n1,235\n \nIncome tax expense\n(\n264\n)\nEquity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes\n44\n \nNet income\n1,015\n \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n69\n \nNet income attributable to Quest Diagnostics\n$\n946\n \n    Depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n    \n2024\n2023\n2022\nDIS business\n$\n352\n \n$\n319\n \n$\n305\n \nAll other operating segments\n13\n \n11\n \n12\n \nGeneral corporate\n128\n \n109\n \n120\n \nTotal depreciation and amortization\n$\n493\n \n$\n439\n \n$\n437\n \nF-50\nTable of Contents\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n    \n    Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDIS business\n$\n410\n \n$\n398\n \n$\n384\n \nAll other operating segments\n7\n \n8\n \n19\n \nGeneral corporate\n8\n \n2\n \n1\n \nTotal capital expenditures\n$\n425\n \n$\n408\n \n$\n404\n \n    \nThe approximate percentage of net revenues by major service for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRoutine clinical testing and other services\n51\n \n%\n51\n \n%\n44\n \n%\nCOVID-19 testing services\n1\n \n2\n \n15\n \nGene-based and esoteric (including advanced diagnostics) testing services\n39\n \n38\n \n32\n \nAnatomic pathology testing services\n6\n \n6\n \n6\n \nAll other\n3\n \n3\n \n3\n \nNet revenues\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n             \nThe approximate percentage of net revenues by customer channel for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPhysician lab services\n68\n \n%\n66\n \n%\n68\n \n%\nHospital lab services\n20\n \n21\n \n18\n \nOther DIS\n9\n \n10\n \n11\n \nTotal DIS revenues\n97\n \n97\n \n97\n \nDS revenues\n3\n \n3\n \n3\n \nTotal net revenues\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n    Physician lab services includes net revenues for physicians including those associated with ACOs and FQHCs.\n20.    \nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nDuring January 2025 and February 2025, the Company entered into various fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the Company's long-term debt into variable interest rate debt. The aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements was $\n550\n million.\nF-51"
