    "item1": "Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K (“Item 1”).\nVision and 2028 Goals\nAs we execute on our Vision, we established our 2028 Enterprise Goals (“2028 Goals”) to provide our investors with specific metrics to measure our progress.  Our 2028 Goals are:\n▪\nCorporate\n▪\nDeliver a mid-single digits adjusted diluted EPS compounded annual growth rate in 2028 from a $4.84 base in 2022 (for our progress through 2024, see \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n);\n▪\nA progressive dividend goal targeting mid-single digits dividend per share growth annually through 2028;\n▪\nTarget a debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.0x (see \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n);\n▪\nMaintain our leadership position in the U.S. tobacco space; and\n▪\nMaintain a total adjusted OCI margin of at least 60% in each year through 2028 (see \nOperating Results by Business Segment\n).\n▪\nU.S. Smoke-Free Portfolio\n▪\nGrow U.S. smoke-free volumes by at least 35% from our 2022 base of 800 million units by 2028 (see \nOperating Results by Business Segment\n); and\n▪\nApproximately double our U.S. smoke-free net revenues to $5 billion by 2028 from our 2022 base, with $2 billion sourced from innovative smoke-free products (see \nOperating Results by Business Segment\n).\nWe are reassessing our U.S. smoke-free goals due to the continued proliferation of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products resulting from insufficient enforcement action against manufacturers, distributors and retailers of these products.  We anticipate providing updated U.S. smoke-free goals when we have more clarity on how the legitimate e-vapor market may evolve.  For additional information on the e-vapor category, see \nOperating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment.\n▪\nLong-Term Growth\n▪\nCompete internationally in the top innovative oral tobacco markets and develop a pathway to participate in heated tobacco and e-vapor markets; and\n▪\nEnter non-nicotine categories with broad commercial distribution of at least five products by 2028.\nOptimize & Accelerate\n \nInitiative\nIn October 2024, we announced a multi-phase Initiative designed to modernize our ways of working as we work towards achieving our Vision and 2028 Goals.  Through the Initiative, we plan to increase our organization’s speed, efficiency and effectiveness by centralizing work, outsourcing certain transactional tasks and streamlining, automating and standardizing processes.  We expect the design and detailed plans for all phases of the Initiative to be substantially complete in early 2026.  As part of the Initiative, we established an ABS organization within ALCS.  This organization will be responsible for driving efficiency and process improvement across our companies in partnership with external service providers.\nWe expect the initial phases of the Initiative will deliver at least $600 million in cumulative cost savings over the next five years, which we plan to reinvest in our businesses in support of our Vision and 2028 Goals.  The cumulative cost savings exclude our estimated total pre-tax charges for the Initiative’s initial phases of approximately $100 million to $125 million, which we will treat as special items and exclude from our adjusted diluted EPS.  For further discussion of the Initiative, see Note 7. \nAsset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs \nto our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 7”).\nTrends and Developments\nIn this MD&A section, we discuss factors that have impacted our businesses as of the date of this Form 10-K.  In addition, we are aware of and address certain trends and developments that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on our businesses, including the value of our investments in equity securities, in the future.  We focus in this \nTrends and Developments \nsection on the discretionary income pressures on adult tobacco consumers, illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and recent regulatory and executive actions and their effects or potential effects on our businesses.\nU.S. adult tobacco consumers remained under pressure throughout 2024 largely due to the compounding effects of high prices exceeding overall wage growth and historically high levels of consumer credit and credit card delinquency rates.  Although inflation rates stabilized in 2024, increased prices continued to pressure adult tobacco consumers.  These pressures influenced the discount segment retail share growth within the cigarette industry year-over-year.  We will continue to monitor conditions that impact adult tobacco consumer discretionary income and overall purchasing behaviors, including overall tobacco product expenditures, mix between premium and discount brand purchases and adoption of smoke-free products.  We expect discretionary income pressures will continue to influence adult tobacco consumers’ purchase behaviors in 2025.\nProduct assortment, regulation and enforcement continue to evolve in the e-vapor category.  For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, we estimate the e-vapor category grew by approximately 30% versus the prior 12-month period, driven by the growth of illicit \n20\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nflavored disposable e-vapor products.  We estimate that illicit products now represent more than 60% of the e-vapor category.  In response to the proliferation of illicit disposable e-vapor products, states and the federal government took various regulatory and enforcement actions throughout the year in 2024, but these actions have failed to curb this trend.  Select states have established e-vapor product registries based on PMTA submissions or MGOs.  Additionally, we continue to see increased illicit activity across multiple tobacco categories, including nicotine pouch products and cigarettes.\nTobacco companies are subject to broad and evolving regulatory and legislative frameworks that could have a material impact on our businesses.  For example, the FDA submitted proposed product standards banning menthol in cigarettes, which was delayed indefinitely in April 2024, and banning all characterizing flavors in cigars, both of which were withdrawn in January 2025.  In addition, in January 2025, the FDA proposed a tobacco product standard that would establish a maximum nicotine level in cigarettes and certain other combustible tobacco products significantly lower than the average concentration in these products on the market today with the aim of making such products minimally or non-addictive.  The proposed rule is subject to the Trump Administration’s January 2025 executive order pausing all federal agency rulemaking for 60 days.  Following the 60-day pause, the proposed product standard, if not withdrawn, may proceed through the rulemaking process, including the solicitation of public comment.\nSee \nOperating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment\n for additional information on the trends and developments discussed above.\nABI’s business is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation, commodity price movements and other macroeconomic factors that could impact financial performance from time to time.  We will continue to monitor these conditions and other factors as they could affect our equity earnings, our other comprehensive earnings/losses and the dividends that we receive from ABI, and the fair value of our investment in ABI.  See Note 8 for additional information on our investment in ABI.\nThe trends and developments discussed above have not had a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, but we continue to monitor these trends and developments and potential financial impacts.  While the growth of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products has caused us to reassess certain of our 2028 Goals, we do not believe the trends and developments discussed above have materially impacted our ability to achieve our Vision.  As the trends and developments evolve and new ones emerge, we will continue to evaluate the potential impacts on our businesses, investments and Vision.\n21\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe changes in net earnings and diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2024, from the year ended December 31, 2023, were due primarily to the following:\n(in millions, except per share data)\nNet Earnings\nDiluted EPS\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\n$\n8,130 \n$\n4.57 \n2023 NPM Adjustment Items\n(38)\n(0.02)\n2023 Acquisition, disposition and integration-related items\n26 \n0.01 \n2023 Tobacco and health and certain other litigation items\n323 \n0.18 \n2023 Loss on disposition of JUUL equity securities\n250 \n0.14 \n2023 ABI-related special items\n70 \n0.03 \n2023 Cronos-related special items\n29 \n0.02 \n2023 Income tax items\n32 \n0.02 \nSubtotal 2023 special items\n692 \n0.38 \n2024 NPM Adjustment Items\n20\n \n0.01\n \n2024 Acquisition, disposition and integration-related items\n1,862\n \n1.08\n \n2024 Asset impairment, exit and implementation costs\n(315)\n(0.18)\n2024 Tobacco and health and certain other litigation items\n(76)\n(0.04)\n2024 ABI-related special items\n(2)\n—\n \n2024 Cronos-related special items\n(15)\n(0.01)\n2024 Income tax items\n969\n \n0.56\n \nSubtotal 2024 special items\n2,443\n \n1.42\n \nFewer shares outstanding\n—\n \n0.17\n \nChange in tax rate\n47\n \n0.03\n \nOperations\n(48)\n(0.03)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\n$\n11,264\n \n$\n6.54\n \n2024 Reported Net Earnings \n$\n11,264\n \n$\n6.54\n \n2023 Reported Net Earnings \n$\n8,130 \n$\n4.57 \n% Change\n38.5\n \n%\n43.1\n \n%\n2024 Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS\n$\n8,821\n \n$\n5.12\n \n2023 Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS\n$\n8,822 \n$\n4.95 \n% Change\n—\n \n%\n3.4\n \n%\nFor a discussion of special items and other business drivers affecting the comparability of statements of earnings amounts and reconciliations of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS, see \nConsolidated Operating Results\n below.\n▪\nFewer Shares Outstanding: \nFewer shares outstanding were due to shares we repurchased under our share repurchase programs.\n▪\nChange in Tax Rate:\n The change in the tax rate (which excludes the impact of special items shown in the table above) was driven primarily by lower state tax expense.\n▪\nOperations: \nThe decrease of $48 million in operations (which excludes the impact of special items shown in the table above) was due primarily to lower OCI and lower net periodic benefit income, excluding service cost.\nFor further details, see\n Consolidated Operating Results \nand \nOperating Results by Business Segment \nbelow.\n22\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nCompounded EPS Growth Rate\nOur 2028 Goals include delivering a mid-single digits adjusted diluted EPS compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) in 2028 from a $4.84 base in 2022.

However, our management also reviews certain financial results, including OCI, OCI margins, net earnings and diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that our management believes are not part of underlying operations.  These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition, disposition and integration-related items, equity investment-related special items, certain income tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer (“NPM”) adjustment disputes under the Master Settlement Agreement (“NPM Adjustment Items”).  In addition, our management reviews the ratio of debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA, which we use as a factor to determine our ability to access the capital markets and make investments in pursuit of our Vision.  Consolidated EBITDA is calculated in accordance with our Credit Agreement (defined below in \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n) and includes certain adjustments.  Our management does not view any of these special items to be part of our underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results.  Our management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis, which may exclude certain income tax items from our reported effective tax rate.\nOur management believes that the foregoing financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results, and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results.  Our management uses these financial measures and regularly provides these to our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating capital and other resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.  The foregoing financial measures are not required by, or calculated in accordance with, GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.  The foregoing financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  When we provide a non-GAAP measure in this Form 10-K, we also provide a reconciliation of that non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nDiscussion and Analysis\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNote 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 2”) includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  In most instances, we must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under GAAP.\nThe preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.  Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n23\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nThe following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n▪\nRevenue Recognition: \nOur businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers.  Our businesses define net revenues as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives.  Our businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\nOur businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates.  We include expected payments for sales incentives in accrued marketing liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nFor further discussion, see Note 4. \nRevenues from Contracts with Customers \nto our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n▪\nDepreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation: \nWe depreciate property, plant and equipment and amortize our definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  We depreciate machinery and equipment over periods up to 20 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years.  We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\nWe review long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.  For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If we determine that an impairment exists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.  We base impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.  We also review the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\nWe conduct a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment as of October 1 of each year, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require us to perform an interim review.  We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.  If necessary, we will perform a single step quantitative impairment test.  Additionally, we have the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired.  We measure the amount of impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit; however, the amount of the impairment loss is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit.  If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, we consider the intangible asset to be impaired and reduce the carrying value to fair value in the period identified.\nWe use an income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and trademarks using information available as of the impairment testing date.  The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows.\nGoodwill by reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(in millions)\nGoodwill\nIndefinite-Lived\nIntangible Assets\nCigarettes\n$\n22\n \n$\n2\n \nMST products\n5,023\n \n8,447\n \nCigars\n77\n \n2,640\n \nOral nicotine pouches\n55\n \n—\n \nE-vapor\n1,768\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n6,945\n \n$\n11,089\n \nSecond Quarter of 2024 Skoal Impairment:\nAt December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the \nSkoal\n trademark exceeded its carrying value of $3.9 billion by approximately 6% ($0.2 billion).  Sales volumes of MST products, including \nSkoal\n, have been negatively impacted due in part to evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, which has resulted in consumers increasingly moving across tobacco categories.  In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2024, we evaluated the accelerated growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related increase in competitive activity among tobacco categories, which have \n24\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\ncontributed to reductions in sales volumes for MST products, including \nSkoal\n.  We concluded that the expected impact from the sales volume declines on the \nSkoal\n trademark represented a triggering event and, as a result of this conclusion, we performed an interim impairment assessment as of June 30, 2024.  We determined the estimated fair value of the \nSkoal\n trademark as of June 30, 2024, was below its carrying value and recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment of $354 million during the second quarter of 2024, which was recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Our estimate of the fair value and carrying value of the \nSkoal\n trademark at June 30, 2024 was $3.6 billion after recording the impairment.\n2024 Annual Review of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets:\nWe completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets performed as of October 1, 2024.  We elected to perform a qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets were below carrying value.  For certain of our other reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we elected to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment.\nUpon completion of this testing, we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values in all circumstances and thus, no impairment charges were recorded.  The estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values for all of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets with the exception of our \nSkoal\n trademark and e-vapor reporting unit discussed below.\nAlthough the estimated fair value of the \nSkoal\n trademark exceeded its carrying value of $3.6 billion by approximately 7% ($0.3 billion), MST products, including \nSkoal\n, continued to be negatively impacted due in part to evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, which have continued to contribute to reductions in sales volumes for MST products, including \nSkoal, \nas discussed above.  We believe if the decline in sales volume for \nSkoal\n is higher than currently estimated and results in material revenue declines, there may be a material adverse effect on the significant assumptions used in performing our valuation.  These adverse effects, including if \nSkoal\n’s actual revenue and income or long-term outlook are significantly unfavorable compared to forecasted performance used to estimate the fair value or if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value increases, could result in a material non-cash impairment of our \nSkoal\n trademark in future periods.  Based on the 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment charge to the \nSkoal\n intangible asset of approximately $85 million.\nWhile the estimated fair value of our e-vapor reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 28% ($0.3 billion), we continue to monitor several factors that could impact the carrying value of our e-vapor reporting unit’s goodwill, including the following:\n▪\nAltria and certain of our affiliates, including NJOY, are defendants in lawsuits alleging patent infringement based on the sale of \nNJOY ACE \nin the United States.  On January 29, 2025, the ITC issued its final determination regarding the complaint filed by JUUL against Altria and certain of our affiliates, including NJOY, finding that \nNJOY ACE\n infringes on JUUL’s patents and issued an exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders prohibiting the importation and sale of \nNJOY ACE\n in the United States.  The ITC’s determination is currently under a 60-day review period by the Office of the United States Trade Representative which could reject the ITC’s determination.  If the Trade Representative does not affirmatively reject the ITC’s determination, the determination will automatically become final and the ITC’s orders will take effect on March 31, 2025, or earlier if the Trade Representative notifies the ITC of approval before the 60 days elapse.  The final exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but the final exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders prohibiting the importation and sale of \nNJOY ACE\n would likely not be stayed during the pendency of such an appeal.  We continue to vigorously defend this litigation, including our motion filed in February 2025 seeking reconsideration of the ITC’s determination on one of the four patents as discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K (“Item 3”).\n▪\nAdditionally, sales of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products continue to increase with limited effective enforcement against these products, contributing to declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume, which negatively impacted \nNJOY ACE’s \nvolume growth in 2024.\nWe are pursuing pathways to minimize the disruption the ITC’s decision could cause.  NJOY is working on a product solution that addresses all of the patents at issue in the event the Trade Representative does not affirmatively reject the ITC’s determination.  Additionally, NJOY is pursuing potential solutions with a pipeline of other alternative e-vapor products.  However, in the event the Trade Representative does not affirmatively reject the ITC’s determination, it is likely that NJOY will not be able to sell \nNJOY ACE\n in the United States until a product solution addressing all of the patents at issue in the ITC action has received the necessary regulatory approvals.\nIf we continue to experience unfavorable outcomes with respect to the patent infringement lawsuits and our related strategies, or if continued illicit e-vapor product sales or other factors result in a significantly different long-term outlook for NJOY’s volume growth rates versus projections, there may be a material adverse effect on the significant assumptions used in performing our valuation.  These adverse effects, including if NJOY’s actual revenue and income or long-term outlook are significantly unfavorable compared to forecasted performance used to estimate the fair value or if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value increases, could result in a \n25\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nmaterial non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit’s goodwill or related definite-lived intangible assets (carrying value of $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024), or both, in future periods.  Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets.  The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast.  The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively.  Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, \nNJOY ACE\n; and (vi) ability of\n NJOY ACE\n to remain on the market.  Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows.  In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes.  For further discussion of these factors, see \nOperating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment \nbelow.\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the \nSkoal\n trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n▪\nInvestments in Equity Securities: \nAt the end of each reporting period, we\n \nreview our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value.  If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified.  We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n▪\nMarketing Costs:\n Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs.  These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues.  We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties.  Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.  For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n▪\nContingencies: \nAs discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees.  In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims.  PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, “State Settlement Agreements”).  \n26\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nPM USA’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments, including roll-your-own cigarettes, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due.  PM USA’s obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to make quarterly payments with respect to settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees ended in the fourth quarter of 2024.  In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA.  Payments under the State Settlement Agreements and the FDA user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, operating income, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment.  Our subsidiaries account for the cost of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees as a component of cost of sales.  Our subsidiaries recorded approximately $3.7 billion and $4.0 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees.\nWe record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed in Note 20 and Item 3: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any pending litigation; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any pending case; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.  We expense litigation defense costs as incurred and include such costs in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n▪\nEmployee Benefit Plans: \nWe\n \nprovide a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits.  We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.  We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so.  Any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and record as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (income).  We subsequently amortize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) into net periodic benefit cost (income) in future years.\nDue to changes in market factors, our discount rates used to determine our pension plan and postretirement plan obligations increased to 5.7% at December 31, 2024 from 5.3% and 5.2%, respectively, for these plans at December 31, 2023.  We presently anticipate net pre-tax pension and postretirement income of approximately $15 million in 2025 versus net pre-tax income of $46 million in 2024.  This decrease is due primarily to lower expected income on plan assets and higher amortization of net unrecognized losses in 2025, partially offset by lower service and interest costs.  Assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in our discount rates would increase (decrease) our pension and postretirement expense by approximately $10 million.  Similarly, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our pension and postretirement expense by approximately $40 million.\nFor additional information see Note 18. \nBenefit Plans\n to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 18”).\n▪\nIncome Taxes:\n Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.  We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  We determine the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence.  In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.  The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  For those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements.  We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nWe recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2024 and 2023 as a result of various tax events.\nFor additional information on income taxes, see Note 16. \nIncome Taxes \nto our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 16”).\n27\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nConsolidated Operating Results\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet Revenues:\nSmokeable products\n$\n21,204\n \n$\n21,756 \nOral tobacco products\n2,776\n \n2,667 \nAll other\n38\n \n60 \nNet revenues\n$\n24,018\n \n$\n24,483 \nExcise Taxes on Products:\nSmokeable products\n$\n3,469\n \n$\n3,869 \nOral tobacco products\n105\n \n112 \nExcise taxes on products\n$\n3,574\n \n$\n3,981 \nOperating Income:\nOCI:\nSmokeable products\n$\n10,821\n \n$\n10,670 \nOral tobacco products\n1,449\n \n1,722 \nAll other\n(414)\n(74)\nAmortization of intangibles\n(139)\n(128)\nGeneral corporate expenses\n(476)\n(643)\nOperating income\n$\n11,241\n \n$\n11,547 \nAs discussed further in Note 17, our CODM reviews OCI, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, our segments.

We recorded a corresponding adjustment to the JUUL tax valuation allowance in 2023.  For further discussion, see Note 8 and Note 16.\n▪\nABI-Related Special Items: \nWe recorded net pre-tax expense of $2 million from our investment in ABI for the year ended December 31, 2024, which consists primarily of mark-to-market losses on certain ABI financial instruments associated with its share commitments, mostly offset by a gain related to the ABI Transaction.  For further information on the gain related to the ABI Transaction, see Note 8.\nWe recorded net pre-tax losses of $89 million from our investment in ABI for the year ended December 31, 2023, consisting primarily of mark-to-market losses on certain ABI financial instruments associated with its share commitments and a loss on ABI’s sale of certain brands and associated assets in the United States.\nThe ABI-related special items include our respective share of the amounts recorded by ABI and additional adjustments related to (i) the conversion of ABI-related special items from international financial reporting standards to GAAP and (ii) adjustments to our investment required under the equity method of accounting.\n▪\nCronos-Related Special Items: \nWe recorded pre-tax losses of $29 million for Cronos-related special items for the year ended December 31, 2023, substantially all of which related to our share of special items recorded by Cronos.  We recorded a corresponding adjustment to the Cronos tax valuation allowance.\n▪\nIncome Tax Items:\n We recorded income tax items of $969 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, due primarily to an income tax benefit from partial releases of valuation allowances on JUUL-related losses in connection with an agreement reached in October 2024 with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and in connection with the ABI Transaction.  For further discussion, see Note 16.\nWe recorded income tax items of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, due primarily to tax expense associated with a tax basis adjustment related to our investment in ABI.\n2024 Compared with 2023\nNet revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, decreased $465 million (1.9%), due primarily to lower net revenues in the smokeable products segment, partially offset by higher net revenues in the oral tobacco products segment.\nCost of sales decreased $141 million (2.3%), due primarily to lower shipment volume in our smokeable products segment, partially offset by higher per unit settlement charges and higher manufacturing costs in our smokeable products segment and higher NJOY costs.\nExcise taxes on products decreased $407 million (10.2%), due primarily to lower shipment volume in our smokeable products segment.\nMarketing, administration and research costs were unchanged compared to 2023 as higher costs, including NJOY and other costs in support of our Vision and 2024 costs related to the Initiative, were offset by lower general corporate expenses.  The lower general corporate expenses were due primarily to lower charges to resolve certain JUUL-related litigation and the 2023 settlement of the shareholder derivative lawsuits, partially offset by higher net acquisition-related costs primarily associated with the NJOY Transaction and 2024 transaction costs from the ABI Transaction.  See Note 3, Note 8 and Note 20 for a discussion of litigation items.\n29\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nOperating income decreased $306 million (2.7%), due primarily to lower OCI (which includes a non-cash impairment of the \nSkoal\n trademark in our oral tobacco product segment and costs related to the Initiative), partially offset by lower general corporate expenses.\nInterest and other debt expense, net increased $48 million (4.9%), due primarily to 2023 interest income associated with the sale of the \nIQOS \nSystem commercialization rights and unfavorable NPM Adjustment Items, partially offset by 2023 interest expense and fees for the term loan facility associated with the NJOY Transaction.  For additional information regarding the sale of the\n IQOS\n System commercialization rights, see Note 6.\nNet periodic benefit income, excluding service cost, decreased by $25 million (19.7%), due primarily to lower income on plan assets and higher amortization of net unrecognized losses in 2024.

For additional information, see Note 16.\nReported net earnings of $11,264 million increased $3,134 million (38.5%), due primarily to the gain on the sale of the \nIQOS\n System commercialization rights, favorable income tax items and favorable results from our investments in equity securities, partially offset by lower operating income.  Reported basic and diluted EPS of $6.54, each increased by 43.1% due to higher reported net earnings and fewer shares outstanding.\nAdjusted net earnings of $8,821 million were essentially unchanged compared to 2023, as lower OCI and lower net periodic benefit income, excluding service costs, was offset by a lower adjusted tax rate.  Adjusted diluted EPS of $5.12 increased by 3.4%, due to fewer shares outstanding.\n \nOperating Results by Business Segment\nBusiness Environment\nSummary\nThe U.S. tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position or our ability to achieve our Vision.  These challenges, some of which are discussed in more detail in Note 20,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A.\n48\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nOther Long-Term Liabilities \n- We had $0.9 billion of accrued postretirement health care costs on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and estimate approximately $84 million of annual payments.  In addition, we had accrued pension obligations, substantially all of which are funded from plan assets.  For further information on our postretirement health care and pension obligations, see Note 18.\nIn October 2024, we entered into an agreement with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of a $6.4 billion ordinary loss we recognized in 2023 for cash tax purposes with respect to a portion of our tax basis associated with our former investment in JUUL.  As a result, other liabilities decreased approximately $1.1 billion, which included the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit associated with the $6.4 billion ordinary loss position recognized in 2023, as further discussed in Note 16.\nWe are unable to estimate the timing of payments of other long-term liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.\nEquity and Dividends\nDuring 2024, we paid dividends of $6.8 billion, essentially unchanged from 2023, reflecting a higher dividend rate, mostly offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of shares we repurchased under our share repurchase programs.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, our Board approved a 4.1% increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $1.02 per share of our common stock versus the previous rate of $0.98 per share.  Our current annualized dividend rate is $4.08 per share.  Our 2028 Goals include a progressive dividend goal targeting mid-single digits dividend per share growth annually through 2028.  Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of our Board.\nIn March 2024, we increased our $1.0 billion share repurchase program to $3.4 billion and entered into ASR transactions for our common stock.  In the first half of 2024, we paid $2.4 billion for the repurchase of our common stock in the ASR transactions.  We funded the ASR transactions with proceeds from the ABI Transaction.\nFor further discussion of our share repurchase programs, see Note 12 and Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Form 10-K.\nFinancial Review\nCash Provided by/Used in Operating Activities\nDuring 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.8 billion compared with $9.3 billion during 2023.  This decrease was due primarily to lower net revenues, payments for certain transferable income tax credits, higher litigation payments and a portion of the NJOY contingent payments ($140 million), partially offset by lower payments for (i) federal excise taxes and (ii) Statement Settlement Agreements, due primarily to lower smokeable products shipment volume.\nWe had a working capital deficit at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and believe we have the ability to fund working capital deficits with cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and access to the credit and capital markets.\nCash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities\nDuring 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was $2.2 billion compared with net cash used in investing activities of $1.3 billion during 2023.  This change was due primarily to proceeds from the ABI Transaction in 2024 and the payments for the NJOY Transaction in 2023, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of \nIQOS\n System commercialization rights in 2023.\nCapital expenditures for 2024 decreased 27.6% to $142 million.  We expect capital expenditures for 2025 to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million, which are expected to be funded from operating cash flows.\nCash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities\nDuring 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $11.5 billion compared with $8.4 billion during 2023.  This increase was due primarily to higher share repurchases in 2024, issuance of long-term debt in 2023 and a portion of the NJOY contingent payments ($110 million), partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt in 2024.\nNew Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 2\n \nfor a discussion of issued accounting guidance applicable to, but not yet adopted by, us.\nContingencies\nSee Note 20 and Item 3 for a discussion of contingencies.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nPM USA (“Guarantor”), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Parent”), has guaranteed the Parent’s obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (“Guarantees”).  Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the \n49\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\npayment and performance of the Parent’s obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (“Obligations”), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations.  The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n▪\nreceived less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n▪\neither:\n▪\nwas insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n▪\nwas engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n▪\nintended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing.  Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n▪\nthe sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n▪\nthe present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n▪\nit could not pay its debts as they become due.\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees.  For this purpose, “Bankruptcy Law” means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n▪\nthe date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n▪\nthe date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n▪\nthe payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n▪\nthe rating of the Parent’s long-term senior unsecured debt by S&P of A or higher.\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt (“Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”) are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.\n50\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nThe following tables include summarized financial information for the Parent and the Guarantor.

(“PM USA”), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; John Middleton Co. (“Middleton”), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and is a wholly owned subsidiary of PM USA; UST LLC (“UST”), which, through its wholly owned subsidiary U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC (“USSTC”), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of moist smokeless tobacco (“MST”) products; Helix Innovations LLC (“Helix”), which operates in the United States, and its foreign affiliates (“Helix International”), which operate in certain other countries, are engaged in the manufacture and sale of oral nicotine pouches; and NJOY, LLC (“NJOY”), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of e-vapor products.  Other wholly owned subsidiaries included Altria Group Distribution Company (“AGDC”), which provides sales and distribution services to our domestic operating companies, and Altria Client Services LLC (“ALCS”), which provides various support services to our companies in areas such as legal, regulatory, research and product development, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs.  Our access to the operating cash flows of our subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans.  At December 31, 2024, our significant subsidiaries were not limited by contractual obligations in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.\nAs discussed in Note 3. \nAcquisition of NJOY\n, on June 1, 2023, we completed our acquisition of NJOY Holdings, Inc. (“NJOY Holdings”), the parent of NJOY.  As a result of the acquisition, NJOY became a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria.\nIn October 2022, we entered into a joint venture with JTI (US) Holding, Inc. (“JTIUH”), a subsidiary of Japan Tobacco Inc., for the U.S. marketing and commercialization of heated tobacco stick (“HTS”) products.  The joint venture entity, Horizon Innovations LLC (“Horizon”), is structured to exist in perpetuity and is responsible for the U.S. marketing and commercialization of HTS products owned by either party.  At December 31, 2024, we owned a \n75\n% economic interest in Horizon; JTIUH owned the remaining \n25\n% economic interest.  As of January 30, 2025, there are no products in the U.S. marketplace from the joint venture.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had investments in Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“ABI”) and Cronos Group Inc. (“Cronos”).  In March 2024, we sold a portion of our investment in ABI (“ABI Transaction”).  In March 2023, we entered into a stock transfer agreement with JUUL Labs, Inc. (“Stock Transfer Agreement”) pursuant to which we transferred to JUUL Labs, Inc. (“JUUL”) all of our beneficially owned JUUL equity securities.  In exchange, we received a non-exclusive, irrevocable global license to certain of JUUL’s heated tobacco intellectual property (“JUUL Heated Tobacco IP”).  For further discussion of our current and former investments and the ABI Transaction, see Note 8. \nInvestments in Equity Securities\n.\n▪\nBasis of Presentation:\n \nOur consolidated financial statements include Altria, as well as our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries.  We account for our investments in equity securities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee, including ABI and Cronos, under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag.  We accounted for our former investment in the equity securities of JUUL at fair value.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of our financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions for goodwill and other intangible assets, investments in equity securities, marketing programs and income taxes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation.\nOn January 1, 2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-03, \nFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions \n(“ASU No. 2022-03”).  This guidance clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value.  This guidance also specifies required disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions.  We applied ASU No. 2022-03 for the fair value disclosure of our investment in ABI.  For further discussion, see Note 8. \nInvestments in Equity Securities.\nAdditionally, in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures \n(“ASU No. 2023-07”).  This guidance \n59\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nrequires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis.  We included expanded footnote disclosures as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2023-07 in Note 17. \nSegment Reporting\n.  We will include interim disclosure requirements in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\nNote 2.  \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n▪\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\n \nCash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  We record cash equivalents at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n▪\nDepreciation, Amortization and Impairment Testing:\n \nWe record property, plant and equipment at historical costs and depreciate by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  We depreciate machinery and equipment over periods up to \n20\n years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to \n50\n years.  We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives up to \n25\n years.\nWe review long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.  For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If we determine that an impairment exists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.  We base impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.  We also review the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\nWe conduct a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment as of October 1 of each year, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require us to perform an interim review.  We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.  If necessary, we will perform a single step quantitative impairment test.  Additionally, we have the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired.  We measure the amount of impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit; however, the amount of the impairment loss is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit.  If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, we consider the intangible asset impaired and reduce the carrying value to fair value in the period identified.\n▪\nDerivative Financial Instruments:\n \nFrom time to time, we enter into derivatives to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk.  We use various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, options and swaps.\nWe record derivative financial instruments at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.  We designate derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges at the inception of the contracts.  For fair value hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, in the consolidated statements of earnings each period.  For cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and reclassify changes to the consolidated statements of earnings in the same periods in which operating results are affected by the respective hedged item.  For net investment hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign currency transaction gains or losses on a nonderivative hedging instrument in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged.  Such amounts remain in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying foreign operations occurs for investments in foreign entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  We classify cash flows from hedging instruments in the same manner as the respective hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated.  We formally designate and document, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and method for assessing hedge effectiveness.  Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we would no longer consider the hedge effective and would record all of the derivative gains and losses in the consolidated statement of earnings in the current period.\nFor financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments or do not qualify for hedge accounting, we record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of earnings each period.  We do not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n60\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\n▪\nEmployee Benefit Plans:\n \nWe provide a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits.  We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and record as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (income).  We subsequently amortize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) into net periodic benefit cost (income) in future years.\n▪\nFair Value Measurements:\n \nWe measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value.  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  We use a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:\nLevel 1\nUnadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2\nObservable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3\nUnobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n▪\nGuarantees:\n \nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities.\n  See Note 20\n. Contingencies - Guarantees and Other Similar Matters\n for a further discussion of guarantees.\n▪\nIncome Taxes:\n \nSignificant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\nWe determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  We determine the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence.  In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.  The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  For those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements.  We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n▪\nInventories:\n \nWe use the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method to determine the cost of the majority of our inventories.  We determine the cost of the remaining inventories using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) and average cost methods.  We record inventories that are measured using the LIFO method at the lower of cost or market.  We state inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventories as a current asset although part of such inventories, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within one year.\n  We determined the cost of approximately \n77\n% and \n76\n% of our inventories at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, using the LIFO method.  The recorded LIFO amounts of our inventories were approximately $\n0.7\n billion lower than the current cost of our inventories at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n▪\nInvestments in Equity Securities:\n \nInvestments in equity securities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option.  The election of the fair value option is irrevocable and is made on an investment by investment basis.\nWe elected to account for our investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting.  Our share of equity (income) losses and other adjustments associated with these investments are included in (income) losses from investments in equity securities in our consolidated statements of earnings.  We report the carrying value for each of our investments in ABI and Cronos in investments in equity securities on our consolidated balance sheets.  We report equity method investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting at cost and adjust these investments each period for our share of (income) losses and dividends paid, if any.  We report our share of ABI’s and Cronos’s results using a one-quarter lag because results are not available in time for us to record them in the concurrent period.  At the end of each reporting period, we review our investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value.  If the carrying value of an investment \n61\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nexceeds its fair value and we determine that the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in our consolidated statements of earnings in the period identified.  We use certain factors to make this determination including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\nSee Note 8. \nInvestments in Equity Securities\n for additional information on our accounting policy for our former investment in JUUL.\n▪\nLitigation Contingencies and Costs:\n \nWe record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  We expense litigation defense costs as incurred and include these costs in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n  See Note 20. \nContingencies\n.\n▪\nMarketing Costs:\n \nOur businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs.  These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues.  We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties.  Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred, and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.  For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n▪\nRevenue Recognition:\n \nOur businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers.  While our businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type, all sales contracts are similarly structured.  These contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer.  Our businesses satisfy all performance obligations within \none year\n; therefore, we expense costs to obtain contracts as incurred and do not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations.  There is no financing component because our businesses expect, at contract inception, that the period between when our businesses transfer product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less.\nOur businesses define net revenues as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives.  Our businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\nOur businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer.  Our businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer.  Our businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings.  Our businesses record an allowance for returned goods, based principally on historical volume and return rates, which is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  Our businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates.  We include expected payments for sales incentives in accrued marketing liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nPayment terms vary depending on product type.  Our businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue, which we include in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized.  PM USA primarily receives payments in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product.  USSTC, Helix and NJOY receive substantially all payments within \none business day\n of a customer obtaining control of the product.  We include amounts due from customers in receivables on our consolidated balance sheets.\n▪\nSupplier Financing:\n \nWe facilitate a voluntary supplier financing program under which participating suppliers may elect to sell receivables due from us to a third-party financial institution.  Our payments are made on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier, and we have no economic interest in a supplier’s sale of a receivable.  All outstanding balances under the supplier financing program are recorded in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets.\n62\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\n▪\nNew Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted: \nThe following table provides a description of issued accounting guidance applicable to, but not yet adopted by, us:\nStandards\nDescription\nEffective Date for Public Entity\nEffect on Financial Statements\nASU No. 2023-09 \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nThe guidance will require additional income tax disclosures, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information.\nThe guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.\nThe guidance will result in expanded disclosures beginning in our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2025.\nASU Nos. 2024-03 and 2025-01 \nIncome Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nThe guidance will require additional disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses.\nThe guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027.\nWe are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.\nNote 3.  \nAcquisition of NJOY\nOn June 1, 2023, we acquired NJOY Holdings (“NJOY Transaction”), which provided us with full global ownership of NJOY’s e-vapor product portfolio, including \nNJOY ACE\n.  The total consideration for the NJOY Transaction of approximately $\n2.9\n billion consisted of approximately $\n2.75\n billion in cash payments (net of cash acquired) plus the fair value of up to $\n500\n million in additional cash payments contingent on receipt of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) authorizations with respect to NJOY’s menthol ($\n250\n million), blueberry ($\n125\n million) and watermelon ($\n125\n million) pod products.  The fair value of these contingent payments at December 31, 2023 and on the acquisition date was approximately $\n130\n million, which was included in the total consideration.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the FDA issued marketing granted orders for \nfour\n NJOY menthol e-vapor products.  As a result, we became obligated to make cash payments totaling $\n250\n million under the acquisition agreement, which we made in July 2024.  Additionally, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately \n$\n140\n million for the change in the fair value of contingent payments for the year ended December 31, 2024.  At December 31, 2024, the fair value of the remaining contingent payments, which relate to blueberry and watermelon pod products, was approximately $\n20\n million.\nContingent payments related to the NJOY Transaction were recognized at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.  Subsequent changes to the fair value of the liability associated with contingent payments are recognized in earnings until the contingency is resolved.  In determining the estimated fair value of contingent payments, we made certain judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which was the likelihood of certain potential regulatory outcomes.  Contingent payments are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nCosts incurred for the NJOY Transaction are recognized in the period in which they are incurred and are included in our consolidated statement of earnings as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nMarketing, administration and research costs:\nChange in fair value of contingent payments\n$\n140\n \n$\n—\n \nOther costs, net \n(1)\n36\n \n63\n \nInterest and other debt expense, net:\n \nFinancing fees\n—\n \n9\n \nTotal NJOY Transaction costs, net\n$\n176\n \n$\n72\n \n(1)\n For the year ended December 31, 2024, these amounts consisted primarily of acquisition-related items associated with patent infringement lawsuits related to the NJOY Transaction.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, these amounts consisted primarily of acquisition-related transaction costs.  For further discussion of the patent infringement lawsuits, see Note 20. \nContingencies\n.\nWe funded the initial NJOY Transaction cash payments at closing through a combination of borrowings under a $\n2.0\n billion term loan facility, the issuance of commercial paper and available cash.  For further discussion regarding the term loan facility, see Note 10 \nShort-Term Borrowings\n.\n63\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nWe accounted for the NJOY Transaction as a business combination.  On June 1, 2024, we finalized our purchase price allocation.  \nThe amounts in the table below represent the final purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the NJOY Transaction, including measurement period adjustments recorded during 2024.\n(in millions)\nPreliminary Purchase Price Allocation \nMeasurement Period Adjustments\nFinal Purchase Price Allocation\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n22\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n22\n \nReceivables\n7\n \n—\n \n7\n \nInventories\n19\n \n—\n \n19\n \nOther assets\n7\n \n—\n \n7\n \nProperty, plant and equipment\n16\n \n—\n \n16\n \nOther intangible assets:\nDeveloped technology (amortizable)\n1,000\n \n—\n \n1,000\n \nTrademarks (amortizable)\n230\n \n(\n40\n)\n190\n \nSupplier agreements (amortizable) \n180\n \n(\n180\n)\n—\n \nAccounts payable\n(\n7\n)\n—\n \n(\n7\n)\nAccrued liabilities\n(\n20\n)\n—\n \n(\n20\n)\nDeferred income taxes\n(\n167\n)\n66\n \n(\n101\n)\nTotal identifiable net assets\n1,287\n \n(\n154\n)\n1,133\n \nTotal consideration \n2,901\n \n—\n \n2,901\n \nGoodwill\n$\n1,614\n \n$\n154\n \n$\n1,768\n \nThe excess of the total consideration over the identifiable net assets acquired in the NJOY Transaction primarily reflects the value of future growth opportunities in the e-vapor category.  \nNo\nne of the goodwill or other intangible assets is deductible for tax purposes.\nThe significant assumptions used in determining the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets included volume growth rates, operating margins, the assessment of acquired technology life cycles and discount rates.  We determined the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets using an income approach.  The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, such as discounted cash flow analyses, and thus were classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  We amortize these intangible assets over a weighted-average period of approximately \n18\n years.\nNote 4.  \nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nWe disaggregate net revenues based on product type.  For further discussion, see Note 17. \nSegment Reporting\n.\nPrior to 2024, substantially all cash discounts, offered in contracts with our customers for prompt payment, were based on a flat rate per unit based on agreed-upon payment terms.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2024 for PM USA and USSTC, cash discounts in contracts with our customers were based on a percentage of the list price based on agreed-upon payment terms.  We record receivables net of the cash discounts on our consolidated balance sheets.\nReceivables and deferred revenue associated with contracts with customers were as follows at December 31:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nReceivables\n$\n177\n \n$\n71\n \nDeferred revenue\n215\n \n258\n \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not expect differences between amounts recorded as receivables and amounts that would be subsequently received; therefore, we did \nno\nt record an allowance for credit losses against these receivables.\nWe record deferred revenue when our businesses receive payment in advance of product shipment.  \nThese payments are included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets until control of such products is obtained by the customer.\n  When cash is received in advance of product shipment, our companies satisfy their performance obligations within \nthree days\n of receiving payment.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no differences between amounts recorded as deferred revenue from contracts with customers and amounts subsequently recognized as revenue.\nWe record an allowance for returned goods, which is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  It is USSTC’s policy to accept authorized sales returns from its customers for products that have passed the freshness date printed on product \n64\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\npackaging due to the limited shelf life of USSTC’s MST products.  We record estimated sales returns, which are based principally on historical volume and return rates, as a reduction to revenues.  Actual sales returns will differ from estimated sales returns to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions.  We reflect differences between actual and estimated sales returns in the period in which the actual amounts become known.  These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  All returned goods are destroyed upon return and not included in inventory.  Consequently, we do not record an asset for USSTC’s right to recover goods from customers upon return.\nSales incentives include variable payments related to goods sold by our businesses.  We include estimates of variable consideration as a reduction to revenues upon shipment of goods to customers.  The sales incentives that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n▪\nPrice promotion payments - \nWe make price promotion payments, substantially all of which are made to our retail partners to incent the promotion of certain product offerings in select geographic areas.\n▪\nWholesale and retail participation payments -\n We make payments to our wholesale and retail partners to incent merchandising and sharing of sales data in accordance with our trade agreements.\nThese estimates primarily include estimated wholesale to retail sales volume and historical acceptance rates.  Actual payments will differ from estimated payments to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions.  Differences between actual and estimated payments are reflected in the period such information becomes available.  These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 5.  \nSupplier Financing\nWe facilitate a voluntary supplier financing program through a third-party intermediary under which participating suppliers may elect to sell receivables due from us to participating third-party financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions (“Program”).  Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether our supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution.  We pay the third-party intermediary a nominal fee to administer the Program.  Under the terms of the agreement with our third-party intermediary, ALCS has a direct obligation to pay the participating financial institutions or the participating suppliers when payment obligations are due, unless such obligations are satisfied by the applicable ALCS affiliate.  Additionally, Altria guarantees the obligations of ALCS to those parties.  We do not enter into agreements with any of the participating financial institutions in connection with the Program.  The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers (up to \n120\n days) is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the Program.\nWe have no economic interest in a supplier’s sale of a receivable.  Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the Program and reaches an agreement with a participating third-party financial institution, the qualifying supplier elects which individual invoices it sells to the financial institution.\nAll outstanding balances under the Program are recorded in \naccounts payable\n on our consolidated balance sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending confirmed outstanding obligations was as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nConfirmed outstanding obligations at beginning of year\n$\n119\n \n$\n8\n \nInvoices confirmed during the year\n563\n \n244\n \nConfirmed invoices paid during the year\n(\n554\n)\n(\n133\n)\nConfirmed outstanding obligations at end of year\n$\n128\n \n$\n119\n \n65\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nNote 6.  \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net, were as follows at December 31:\n \n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nGoodwill\nOther Intangible Assets, net\nGoodwill\nOther Intangible Assets, net\nSmokeable products segment\n$\n99\n \n$\n2,936\n \n$\n99\n \n$\n2,963\n \nOral tobacco products segment\n5,078\n \n8,679\n \n5,078\n \n9,065\n \nOther\n1,768\n \n(1)\n1,358\n \n1,614\n \n(1)\n1,658\n \nTotal\n$\n6,945\n \n$\n12,973\n \n$\n6,791\n \n$\n13,686\n \n(1) \nRepresents e-vapor reporting unit goodwill related to the NJOY Transaction.

Definite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of intellectual property (which includes developed technology), certain cigarette trademarks, e-vapor trademarks and customer relationships, are amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately \n19\n years.  Pre-tax amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n139\n million, $\n128\n million and $\n73\n million, respectively.  We estimate our annual amortization expense for each of the next five years to be approximately $\n150\n million, assuming no additional transactions occur that require the amortization of intangible assets.\nOn April 30, 2024, we assigned the exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to the \nIQOS Tobacco Heating System\n (“\nIQOS\n System”) to Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”) pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement entered into with PMI in October 2022 (“\nIQOS\n Transaction”).  In exchange for the assignment of the U.S. commercialization rights to the \nIQOS\n System, we received total cash payments of approximately $\n2.8\n billion ($\n1.0\n billion in 2022 and $\n1.8\n billion, including interest, in the third quarter of 2023), $\n2.7\n billion of which was classified as a deferred gain on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023.  Upon the assignment of the U.S. commercialization rights to the \nIQOS\n System, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n2.7\n billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 in our consolidated statement of earnings.\nThe changes in goodwill and net carrying amount of intangible assets were as follows:\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nGoodwill\n \nOther Intangible Assets, net\nGoodwill \nOther Intangible Assets, net\nBalance at January 1\n$\n6,791\n \n$\n13,686\n \n$\n5,177\n \n$\n12,384\n \nChanges due to:\n   Acquisitions \n(1)\n154\n \n(\n220\n)\n1,614\n \n1,430\n \n   Asset impairment \n—\n \n(\n354\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n   Amortization \n—\n \n(\n139\n)\n— \n(\n128\n)\nBalance at December 31\n$\n6,945\n \n$\n12,973\n \n$\n6,791\n \n$\n13,686\n \n(1) \nSubstantially all of the 2023 amounts are attributable to the NJOY Transaction.  The 2024 amounts represent the measurement period adjustments related to the NJOY Transaction.  See Note 3. \nAcquisition of NJOY\n.\nAt December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the \nSkoal\n trademark exceeded its carrying value of $\n3.9\n billion by approximately \n6\n% ($\n0.2\n billion).  Sales volumes of MST products, including \nSkoal\n, have been negatively impacted due in part to evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, which has resulted in consumers increasingly moving across tobacco categories.  In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2024, we evaluated the accelerated growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related increase in competitive activity among tobacco categories, which have \n66\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\ncontributed to reductions in sales volumes for MST products, including \nSkoal\n.  We concluded that the expected impact from the sales volume declines on the \nSkoal\n trademark represented a triggering event, and as a result of this conclusion, we performed an interim impairment assessment as of June 30, 2024.  As a result of (i) lower projected revenue and income due to lower volume assumptions, (ii) a decrease in the perpetual growth rate to \n0\n% (\n1\n% at October 1, 2023 valuation) and (iii) an increase in the discount rate to \n11.5\n% (\n11.0\n% at October 1, 2023 valuation), we determined the estimated fair value of the \nSkoal\n trademark as of June 30, 2024, was below its carrying value and recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment of $\n354\n million during the second quarter of 2024, which was recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Our estimate of the fair value and carrying value of the \nSkoal\n trademark at June 30, 2024 was $\n3.6\n billion after recording the impairment.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n  Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, the estimated fair values of the e-vapor reporting unit and \nSkoal\n trademark exceeded their carrying values by approximately \n28\n% ($\n0.3\n billion) and \n7\n% ($\n0.3\n billion), respectively.  A hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $\n125\n million during 2024.  A hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the \nSkoal\n trademark would have resulted in an additional impairment charge of approximately $\n85\n million during 2024.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill.\nWe use an income approach to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and trademarks.  The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risk associated with realizing expected future cash flows.\nIn determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and trademarks in 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rate and discount rate.  All significant inputs used in the valuations are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nAs further discussed in Note 20. \nContingencies\n, on January 29, 2025, the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) issued its final determination, including the form of remedy, in the complaint filed by JUUL against Altria and certain of our affiliates, including NJOY, alleging patent infringement.  Due to other factors that are uncertain at this time, we are not able to estimate the impact of the ITC’s final determination; however, it could result in a material non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit in future periods.\nNote 7.  \nAsset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs\nPre-tax asset impairment, exit and implementation costs consisted of the following for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n(in millions)\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\nImplementation Costs\n (1)\nTotal\nSmokeable products\n$\n31\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n60\n \nOral tobacco products \n(2)\n358\n \n4\n \n362\n \nTotal\n$\n389\n \n$\n33\n \n$\n422\n \n(1)\n Included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statement of earnings.\n(2)\n Includes impairment of the \nSkoal\n trademark of $\n354\n million.  See Note 6. G\noodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\n.\nThere were \nno\n asset impairment, exit or implementation costs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIn October 2024, we announced a multi-phase \nOptimize & Accelerate\n initiative (“Initiative”) designed to modernize our ways of working.  Through the Initiative, we plan to increase our organization’s speed, efficiency and effectiveness by centralizing work, outsourcing certain transactional tasks and streamlining, automating and standardizing processes.  We expect the design and detailed plans for all phases of the Initiative to be substantially complete in early 2026.\nWe estimate total pre-tax charges for the Initiative’s initial phases of approximately $\n100\n million to $\n125\n million.  Of these amounts, during 2024, we incurred \npre-tax charges\n of $\n68\n million, consisting of employee separation cost of $\n35\n million and implementation costs of $\n33\n million.  We expect to record the majority of the remaining costs for these initial phases in the first half of 2025.  Substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures and will consist of severance payments associated with employee separations, implementation costs for new technology and business advisory services and other costs.  Employee separation costs are recorded when probable and reasonably estimable.  As we further develop and finalize detailed plans for the additional phases of the Initiative, we will update estimated pre-tax charges for the Initiative.\nWe made cash payments of $\n11\n million for the Initiative in 2024 all of which were related to implementation costs.  At December 31, 2024, restructuring liabilities, all of which were severance liabilities, were $\n35\n million.\n67\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nNote 8.  \nInvestments in Equity Securities\nThe carrying amount of our investments consisted of the following at December 31:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nABI\n$\n7,880\n \n$\n9,676\n \nCronos\n315\n \n335\n \nTotal\n$\n8,195\n \n$\n10,011\n \n(Income) losses from our current and former investments in equity securities consisted of the following:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nABI\n (1)\n$\n(\n673\n)\n(2)\n$\n(\n539\n)\n$\n1,973\n \nCronos\n (1)\n21\n \n46\n \n228\n \n \n(Income) losses from investments under equity method of accounting\n(\n652\n)\n(\n493\n)\n2,201\n \nJUUL\n—\n \n250\n \n(3)\n1,455\n \n(4)\n(Income) losses from investments in equity securities\n$\n(\n652\n)\n$\n(\n243\n)\n$\n3,656\n \n(1) \nIncludes our share of amounts recorded by our investees and additional adjustments, if required, related to (i) the conversion from international financial reporting standards to GAAP and (ii) adjustments to our investments required under the equity method of accounting.\n(2)\n Includes $\n165\n million of the total pre-tax gain on the ABI Transaction discussed below.\n(3) \nRepresents the loss as a result of the disposition of our JUUL equity securities discussed below.\n(4) \nRepresents the estimated change in fair value.

Our Restricted Shares:\n▪\nare unlisted and not admitted to trading on any stock exchange;\n▪\nare convertible by us into ordinary shares of ABI on a one-for-one basis;\n▪\nrank equally with ordinary shares of ABI with regards to dividends and voting rights; and\n▪\nhave director nomination rights with respect to ABI.\nOn March 14, 2024, we converted \n60\n million of our Restricted Shares into ordinary shares of ABI.  In March 2024, we completed the ABI Transaction, which consisted of the following:\n▪\nWe sold \n35\n million of our ABI ordinary shares in a global secondary offering for gross proceeds of approximately $\n2.2\n billion.\n▪\nWe sold $\n200\n million of our ABI ordinary shares (approximately \n3.3\n million ordinary shares) to ABI in a private transaction.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had an approximate \n8.1\n% ownership interest in ABI, consisting of approximately \n125\n million Restricted Shares and approximately \n34\n million ordinary shares of ABI.  As a result of the ABI Transaction, in the first quarter of 2024, we received pre-tax cash proceeds totaling approximately $\n2.4\n billion and incurred transaction costs of approximately $\n62\n million.  In conjunction with the ABI Transaction, we entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) transactions under two separate agreements with bank counterparties (collectively, “ASR Agreements”) to repurchase shares of our common stock.  For further discussion of the ASR Agreements, see Note 12. \nCapital Stock\n.\nAs a result of the ABI Transaction, we recorded the following pre-tax amounts in our consolidated statement of earnings:\n(in millions)\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nGain on partial sale of our investment\n$\n165\n \nTransaction costs\n(\n62\n)\nTotal pre-tax gain on ABI Transaction\n$\n103\n \n▪\nThe pre-tax gain on the partial sale of our investment was recorded in (income) losses from investments in equity securities and includes a $\n408\n million gain representing the excess of the selling price of the ABI shares sold over the carrying value of those shares, partially offset by a $\n243\n million reclassification of the proportionate share of our pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive losses directly attributable to ABI and our designated net investment hedges related to our investment in ABI (see Note 9. \nFinancial Instruments\n and Note 15. \nOther Comprehensive Earnings/Losses\n).\n▪\nThe pre-tax transaction costs were approximately $\n62\n million ($\n59\n million in marketing, administration and research costs and $\n3\n million in interest and other debt expense, net), substantially all of which were underwriter fees.\nIn addition, in conjunction with the ABI Transaction, we recorded an income tax benefit from the partial release of a valuation allowance of approximately $\n94\n million in provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024.  For further discussion, see Note 16. \nIncome Taxes\n.\nBased on the most recent information provided to us by ABI, we expect to maintain the right to select \ntwo\n nominees for election to ABI’s board of directors at ABI’s 2025 annual general meeting.  We continue to account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting because we have active representation on ABI’s board of directors and certain ABI board committees.  Through this representation, we believe we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of ABI and participate in ABI’s policy making processes.\nWe report our share of ABI’s results using a one-quarter lag because ABI’s results are not available in time for us to record them in the concurrent period.\nThe fair value of our investment in ABI is based on (i) unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for ABI’s ordinary shares and is classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy and (ii) observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets for the Restricted Shares and is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  We can convert our Restricted Shares into ordinary shares at our discretion.  The fair value of each Restricted Share is based on the value of an ordinary share.\nAt December 31, 2024, the fair value of our investment in ABI approximated its carrying value of $\n7.9\n billion.  At December 31, 2023, the fair value of our investment in ABI was $\n12.7\n billion, which exceeded its carrying value of $\n9.7\n billion by approximately \n32\n%.\nAt September 30, 2022, the fair value of our investment in ABI had declined below its carrying value by $\n2.5\n billion or approximately \n22\n%.  We determined the decline in fair value to be other than temporary and recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $\n2.5\n billion during the third quarter of 2022, which was recorded to (income) losses from investments in equity securities in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n69\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our investment in ABI exceeded our share of ABI’s net assets attributable to equity holders of ABI by approximately $\n2.0\n billion, representing a $\n0.5\n billion reduction from December 31, 2023, due primarily to the ABI Transaction.  Substantially all of the $\n2.0\n billion difference at December 31, 2024 is comprised of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (consisting primarily of trademarks).\nInvestment in Cronos\nAt December 31, 2024, we had an approximate \n40.9\n% ownership interest in Cronos, consisting of approximately \n157\n million shares, which we account for under the equity method of accounting.  We report our share of Cronos’s results using a one-quarter lag because Cronos’s results are not available in time for us to record them in the concurrent period.\nThe fair value of our investment in Cronos is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for Cronos’s common shares and is classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nAt December 31, 2024, the fair value of our investment in Cronos approximated its carrying value of $\n315\n million.  At December 31, 2023, the fair value of our investment in Cronos was less than its carrying value by $\n8\n million, or approximately \n2\n%.  Based on our evaluation, we concluded that the decline in fair value of our investment in Cronos below its carrying value at December 31, 2023 was temporary and, therefore, \nno\n impairment was recorded.\nAt June 30, 2022, the fair value of our investment in Cronos was less than its carrying value by approximately \n20\n%.  We determined the decline in fair value to be other than temporary and recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $\n107\n million in the second quarter of 2022, which was recorded to (income) losses from investments in equity securities in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFormer Investment in JUUL\nIn December 2018, we made an investment in JUUL for $\n12.8\n billion and received a \n35\n% economic interest in JUUL through non-voting shares, which we converted at our election into voting shares in November 2020, and a security convertible into additional non-voting or voting shares, as applicable, upon settlement or exercise of certain JUUL convertible securities.  At the time of the investment, we agreed to non-competition obligations generally requiring that we participate in the e-vapor business only through JUUL.  In September 2022, we exercised our option to be released from our JUUL non-competition obligations, resulting in (i) the permanent termination of our non-competition obligations to JUUL, (ii) the loss of our JUUL board designation rights (other than the right to designate one independent director so long as our ownership continued to be at least \n10\n%), our preemptive rights, our consent rights and certain other rights with respect to our investment in JUUL and (iii) the conversion of our JUUL shares to single vote common stock, significantly reducing our voting power.\nAs discussed in Note 1. \nBackground and Basis of Presentation\n, in March 2023, we entered into the Stock Transfer Agreement with JUUL under which we transferred to JUUL all of our beneficially owned JUUL equity securities and, in exchange, received a non-exclusive, irrevocable global license to certain of JUUL’s heated tobacco intellectual property.  In addition, all other agreements between us and JUUL were terminated or we were removed as parties thereto, other than certain litigation-related agreements and a license agreement relating to our non-trademark licensable intellectual property rights in the e-vapor field, which remain in force solely with respect to our e-vapor intellectual property as of or prior to March 3, 2023.\nFollowing the conversion of certain non-voting shares of JUUL into voting shares in the fourth quarter of 2020, we elected to account for our investment in JUUL under the fair value option.  As a result of our loss of certain rights due to our exercise of our option to be released from our JUUL non-competition obligations in the third quarter of 2022, we determined that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of JUUL.  Therefore, we were no longer able to account for our investment in JUUL as an equity method investment.  Beginning with the period ended September 30, 2022 and until March 3, 2023, when we entered into the Stock Transfer Agreement, we accounted for our former investment in JUUL as an investment in an equity security.  Our consolidated statements of earnings include any changes in the estimated fair value of our former investment, which were calculated quarterly.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our former investment in JUUL, which was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy prior to the disposition of our JUUL equity securities:\n(in millions)\nInvestment Balance\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n250\n \nNon-cash, pre-tax (loss) on disposition included in (income) losses from investments in equity securities\n(\n250\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n—\n \n2023 Financial Activity\n▪\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax loss on the disposition of our JUUL equity securities of $\n250\n million as a result of entering into the Stock Transfer Agreement.  Additionally, we considered specific facts and circumstances around the nature of the JUUL Heated Tobacco IP and determined that the fair value of such intellectual property \n70\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nwas not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the date of the transaction.  As a result, we did not record an asset associated with this intellectual property on our consolidated balance sheet.  The primary drivers of this conclusion were (i) our rights to the JUUL Heated Tobacco IP being non-exclusive, (ii) there being no product or technology transferred to us associated with the JUUL Heated Tobacco IP and (iii) there being no connection between the JUUL Heated Tobacco IP and our current product development plans.\n2022 Financial Activity\n▪\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded non-cash, pre-tax unrealized losses of $\n1,455\n million as a result of changes in the estimated fair value of our former investment in JUUL.  The decrease in the estimated fair value was primarily driven by (i) a decrease in the likelihood of a favorable outcome from the FDA for JUUL’s products that were marketed in the United States, which had received marketing denial orders (“MDOs”) in June 2022 and were under additional administrative review at the time of our subsequent quarterly valuations, (ii) a decrease in the likelihood of JUUL maintaining adequate liquidity to fund projected cash needs, which could have resulted in JUUL seeking protection under bankruptcy or other insolvency laws, (iii) projections of higher operating expenses resulting in lower long-term operating margins, (iv) projections of lower JUUL revenues in the United States over time due to lower JUUL volume assumptions and (v) an increase in the discount rate due to changes in market factors, partially offset by the effect of passage of time on the projected cash flows.\nWe used an income approach to estimate the fair value of our former investment in JUUL.  The income approach reflected the discounting of future cash flows for the U.S. and international markets at a rate of return that incorporated the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing future cash flows.\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our former investment in JUUL in 2022, we made certain judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were likelihood of certain potential regulatory and liquidity outcomes, sales volume, operating margins, discount rates and perpetual growth rates.  All significant inputs used in the valuation were classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the (i) likelihood of certain potential regulatory actions impacting the e-vapor category and specifically whether the FDA would ultimately authorize JUUL’s products, which had received the MDOs in June 2022 and were under additional administrative review at the time of our subsequent quarterly valuations; (ii) likelihood of JUUL maintaining adequate liquidity to fund projected cash needs, the absence of which could have resulted in JUUL seeking protection under bankruptcy or other insolvency laws; (iii) risk created by the number and types of legal cases pending against JUUL; (iv) expectations for the future state of the e-vapor category, including competitive dynamics; and (v) timing of international expansion plans.\n  Due to these uncertainties, our future cash flow projections of JUUL were based on a range of scenarios that considered certain potential regulatory, liquidity and market outcomes.\nNote 9.  \nFinancial Instruments\nWe enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk.  We use various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, options and swaps.  We do not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOur investment in ABI, whose functional currency is the Euro, exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk on the carrying value of our investment.  To manage this risk, we may designate Euro denominated unsecured long-term notes (“foreign currency denominated debt”) and certain foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency swap contracts and forward contracts (collectively, “foreign currency contracts”), as net investment hedges of our investment in ABI.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had \nno\n outstanding foreign currency contracts.  When we have foreign currency contracts in effect, counterparties are domestic and international financial institutions.  Under these contracts, we are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by these counterparties.  We manage our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of each counterparty.  The counterparty agreements contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating.  In the event our credit rating falls below investment grade, counterparties to our foreign currency contracts can require us to post collateral.\nThe aggregate carrying value and fair value of our total long-term debt were as follows at December 31:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCarrying value\n$\n24,926\n \n$\n26,233\n \nFair value\n22,741\n \n24,373\n \nForeign currency denominated debt included in long-term debt:\nCarrying value\n3,100\n \n3,303\n \nFair value\n3,059\n \n3,125\n \n71\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nOur estimate of the fair value of our total long-term debt is based on observable market information derived from a third-party pricing source and is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nNet Investment Hedging\nWe recognize changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate in accumulated other comprehensive losses related to ABI.\nWe recognized pre-tax (gains) losses of our net investment hedges of $(\n205\n) million, $\n108\n million and $(\n281\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive losses.\nIn addition, as a result of the ABI Transaction, for the year ended December 31, 2024, we reclassified $\n42\n million of pre-tax gains from our designated net investment hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive losses to (income) losses from investments in equity securities in our consolidated statement of earnings.  For further discussion of the ABI Transaction and reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses, see Note 8. \nInvestments in Equity Securities\n and Note 15. \nOther Comprehensive Earnings/Losses.\nNote 10.  \nShort-Term Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had \nno\n short-term borrowings.\nIn June 2023, we entered into a $\n2.0\n billion term loan facility and borrowed the full amount available to fund a portion of the cash payments at the closing of the NJOY Transaction.  In July 2023, upon receipt of the remaining payment of approximately $\n1.8\n billion (including interest) from PMI related to the sale of the \nIQOS\n System commercialization rights, we repaid the term loan facility in full, at which time the term loan facility terminated in accordance with its terms.\nWe have a $\n3.0\n billion senior unsecured \n5-year\n revolving credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) that expires on October 24, 2028 and includes an option, subject to certain conditions, for us to extend the term for \ntwo\n additional \none-year\n periods.  We intend to use any borrowings under our Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had availability under our Credit Agreement for borrowings of up to an aggregate principal amount of $\n3.0\n billion.\nPricing for interest and fees under our Credit Agreement may be modified in the event of a change in the rating of our long-term senior unsecured debt.  We expect interest rates on borrowings under our Credit Agreement to be based on the \nTerm Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n plus a percentage based on the higher of the ratings of our long-term senior unsecured debt from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”).  The applicable percentage for borrowings under our Credit Agreement at December 31, 2024 was \n1.0\n% based on our long-term senior unsecured debt ratings on that date.  Our Credit Agreement does not include any other rating triggers or any provisions that could require the posting of collateral.\nOur Credit Agreement includes various covenants, one of which requires us to maintain a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to Consolidated Interest Expense of not less than \n4.0\n to 1.0, calculated as of the end of the applicable quarter on a rolling four quarters basis.

(“Parent”), has guaranteed the Parent’s obligations under its outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under its Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (“Guarantees”).  Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent’s obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (“Obligations”), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations.  The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  Neither the Guarantor nor other subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the Obligations are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.\nNote 12.  \nCapital Stock\nAt December 31, 2024, we had \n12\n billion shares of authorized common stock; issued, repurchased and outstanding shares of common stock consisted of the following:\nShares Issued\nShares Repurchased\nShares Outstanding\nBalances, December 31, 2021\n2,805,961,317\n \n(\n982,785,699\n)\n1,823,175,618\n \nStock award activity\n— \n514,816\n \n514,816\n \nRepurchases of common stock\n— \n(\n38,156,312\n)\n(\n38,156,312\n)\nBalances, December 31, 2022\n2,805,961,317\n \n(\n1,020,427,195\n)\n1,785,534,122\n \nStock award activity\n—\n \n676,495\n \n676,495\n \nRepurchases of common stock\n—\n \n(\n22,748,842\n)\n(\n22,748,842\n)\nBalances, December 31, 2023\n2,805,961,317\n \n(\n1,042,499,542\n)\n1,763,461,775\n \nStock award activity\n—\n \n687,715\n \n687,715\n \nRepurchases of common stock\n—\n \n(\n73,497,623\n)\n(\n73,497,623\n)\nBalances, December 31, 2024\n2,805,961,317\n \n(\n1,115,309,450\n)\n1,690,651,867\n \nAt December 31, 2024, we had \n23,991,145\n shares of common stock reserved for stock-based awards under our stock plans.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had \n10\n million authorized shares of serial preferred stock, $\n1.00\n par value; \nno\n shares of serial preferred stock have been issued.\n▪\nDividends: \nIn the third quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors (“Board of Directors” or “Board”) approved a \n4.1\n% increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $\n1.02\n per share of our common stock versus the previous rate of $\n0.98\n per share.

We subsequently entered into ASR Agreements to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of $\n2.4\n billion (“Repurchase Price”).  In the first half of 2024, we paid the Repurchase Price \n74\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nand received \n53.9\n million shares of our common stock.  The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR Agreements was based on volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR transactions, less a discount.  We funded the ASR transactions with proceeds from the ABI Transaction.  The ASR transactions were accounted for as equity transactions and included in cost of repurchased stock on our consolidated balance sheet when the shares were received.  We completed the January 2024 share repurchase program in December 2024.\nIn January 2025, our Board authorized a new $\n1.0\n billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by December 31, 2025.  The timing of share repurchases under this program depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of our Board.\nOur total share repurchase activity was as follows for the years ended December 31:\nJanuary 2024 Share Repurchase Program\nJanuary 2023 Share Repurchase Program\nJanuary 2021 Share Repurchase Program\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2024 \n(1)\n2023\n2022 \n(2)\nTotal number of shares repurchased\n73.5\n \n22.7\n \n38.1\n \nAggregate cost of shares repurchased\n$\n3,400\n \n$\n1,000\n \n$\n1,825\n \nAverage price per share of shares repurchased\n$\n46.26\n \n$\n43.96\n \n$\n47.83\n \n(1)\n Includes \n53.9\n million shares repurchased under the ASR Agreements at an average price per share of $\n44.50\n.\n(2)\n In January 2021, our Board authorized a $\n2.0\n billion share repurchase program that it expanded to $\n3.5\n billion in October 2021, which we completed in December 2022.\nNote 13.  \nStock Plans\nIn 2020, our Board adopted, and shareholders approved, the Altria Group, Inc. 2020 Performance Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”) under which we may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”) and other stock-based awards, as well as cash-based annual and long-term incentive awards to our employees.  Any awards granted under the 2020 Plan may be in the form of performance-based awards, including PSUs subject to the achievement or satisfaction of performance goals and performance cycles.  We may issue up to \n25\n million shares of common stock under the 2020 Plan prior to May 31, 2025.  In addition, under the 2015 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (“Directors Plan”), we may grant up to \none million\n shares of common stock to members of the Board who are not employees of Altria, provided that no awards can be made under the Directors Plan after the awards made immediately following our 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had \n18,507,747\n and \n533,843\n shares available to be granted under the 2020 Plan and the Directors Plan, respectively.\n▪\nRSUs: \nDuring the vesting period, RSUs include nonforfeitable rights to dividend equivalents and may not be sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered.  RSUs are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met.  We estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjust this estimate when subsequent information indicates that the actual number of forfeitures is likely to differ from previous estimates.  RSUs generally vest \nthree years\n after the grant date.\nWe amortize to expense ratably over the restriction period, which is generally \nthree years\n, the fair value of the RSUs at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures.  We recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to RSUs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 of $\n50\n million, $\n47\n million and $\n41\n million, respectively.  We recorded a deferred tax benefit related to this compensation expense of $\n12\n million, $\n12\n million and $\n10\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The unamortized compensation expense related to RSUs was $\n86\n million at December 31, 2024, which we expect to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately \ntwo years\n.\nRSU activity was as follows:\nNumber of Shares\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n3,472,801\n \n$\n46.84\n \nGranted\n1,546,213\n \n$\n43.29\n \nVested\n(\n847,647\n)\n$\n44.94\n \nForfeited\n(\n197,882\n)\n$\n46.74\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n3,973,485\n \n$\n45.87\n \n75\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n67\n million, $\n56\n million and $\n59\n million, respectively, or $\n43.29\n, $\n46.38\n and $\n49.22\n per RSU, respectively.  The total vesting date fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n35\n million, $\n40\n million and $\n29\n million, respectively.\n▪\nPSUs: \nWe granted an aggregate of \n290,980\n, \n255,601\n and \n215,205\n of PSUs during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The payout of the PSUs is based on the extent to which we achieve certain performance measures over the \nthree-year\n performance period.  Performance measures consist of our adjusted diluted earnings per share compounded annual growth rate and a cash conversion measure.  Additionally, the payout resulting from the performance measures is then adjusted up or down by a total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance multiplier, which depends on our relative TSR to a predetermined peer group.  PSUs are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met.  At December 31, 2024, we had \n750,826\n PSUs outstanding, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $\n46.87\n per PSU.  We amortize to expense over the performance period the fair value of PSUs at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures.  We recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to PSUs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 of $\n6\n million, $\n11\n million and $\n9\n million, respectively.

For further information, see Note 8. \nInvestments in Equity Securities\n and Note 9. \nFinancial Instruments.\nNote 16.  \nIncome Taxes\nIn August 2022, the U.S. Government enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act that became effective January 1, 2023.  The main provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that impact us are: (i) a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“Corporate AMT”) and (ii) a 1% excise tax on share repurchases, which is recorded in equity on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity (deficit).\nWe are considered an “applicable corporation” for purposes of Corporate AMT.  We expect our regular federal income tax liability will generally exceed our Corporate AMT liability; however, certain unique circumstances may result in our Corporate AMT liability exceeding our regular federal income tax liability, including when tax losses are reported in a different year than book losses.\nEarnings (losses) before income taxes and provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEarnings (losses) before income taxes:\nUnited States\n$\n13,680\n \n$\n10,971\n \n$\n7,628\n \nOutside United States\n(\n22\n)\n(\n43\n)\n(\n239\n)\nTotal\n$\n13,658\n \n$\n10,928\n \n$\n7,389\n \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes:\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n927\n \n$\n2,346\n \n$\n1,968\n \nState and local\n516\n \n681\n \n603\n \nOutside United States\n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \n1,443\n \n3,028\n \n2,572\n \nDeferred:\nFederal\n764\n \n(\n133\n)\n(\n893\n)\nState and local\n187\n \n(\n97\n)\n(\n54\n)\n951\n \n(\n230\n)\n(\n947\n)\nTotal provision for income taxes\n$\n2,394\n \n$\n2,798\n \n$\n1,625\n \nOur U.S. subsidiaries join in the filing of a U.S. federal consolidated income tax return.

Certain of our state tax returns are currently under examination by various states as part of routine audits conducted in the ordinary course of business.\n78\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n1,608\n \n$\n69\n \n$\n53\n \nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n—\n \n1,548\n \n1\n \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n33\n \n—\n \n16\n \nReductions for tax positions related to IRS Agreement\n(\n1,343\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(\n16\n)\n(\n6\n)\n—\n \nTax settlements\n—\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n1\n)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n282\n \n$\n1,608\n \n$\n69\n \nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate at December 31, 2024, was $\n189\n million, along with $\n27\n million affecting deferred taxes.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate at December 31, 2023, was $\n35\n million, along with $\n1,573\n million affecting deferred taxes, a portion of which would also impact the effective tax rate due to the release of a valuation allowance, as discussed below.\nIn October 2024, we entered into an agreement with the IRS (“IRS Agreement”) regarding the tax treatment of a $\n6.4\n billion ordinary loss we recognized in 2023 for cash tax purposes with respect to a portion of our tax basis associated with our former investment in JUUL.  In 2023, we fully reserved for the tax benefit associated with this ordinary loss by recording an unrecognized tax benefit of $\n1,548\n million.  There was no impact to our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023.  In addition, the $\n1,548\n million increase in unrecognized tax benefits was partially offset by $\n428\n million associated with an indirect deferred tax benefit caused by our estimated Corporate AMT credit carryforward.  Consistent with the terms of the IRS Agreement, we claimed a $\n4.0\n billion ordinary loss and a $\n2.4\n billion capital loss on our 2023 tax return.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a tax benefit of $\n887\n million due to the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefit in our consolidated statement of earnings, resulting in the partial release of a valuation allowance against our JUUL-related losses as discussed below.  The reversals of the unrecognized tax benefit and indirect deferred tax benefit caused by our estimated Corporate AMT credit carryforward in 2023 resulted in a net decrease of $\n1,120\n million in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.\nAt December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amount of accrued interest and penalties on our consolidated balance sheets was $\n18\n million, $\n36\n million and $\n18\n million, respectively.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings $(\n24\n) million, $\n20\n million and $\n8\n million, respectively, of gross interest (income) expense and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions.  We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.\nWe are subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions.  Unrecognized tax benefits reflect the differences between tax positions we have taken or expect to take on income tax returns and the amounts recognized in our financial statements.  Resolution of the related tax positions with the relevant tax authorities may take many years to complete, and such timing is not entirely within our control.  It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain examinations will be resolved, which could result in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $\n1\n million.\n79\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nA reconciliation between actual income taxes and amounts computed by applying the federal statutory rate to earnings before income taxes was as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(dollars in millions)\n$\n%\n$\n%\n$\n%\nU.S. federal statutory rate\n$\n2,868\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n2,295\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n1,552\n \n21.0\n \n%\nIncrease (decrease) resulting from:\nState and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n557\n \n4.1\n \n463\n \n4.2\n \n435\n \n5.9\n \nTax basis in foreign investments\n(\n11\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\n34\n \n0.3\n \n11\n \n0.1\n \nUncertain tax positions\n(\n15\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\n8\n \n0.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \nInvestment in ABI\n(\n35\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n37\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n24\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\nInvestment in JUUL\n—\n \n—\n \n53\n \n0.5\n \n306\n \n4.1\n \nInvestment in Cronos\n3\n \n—\n \n11\n \n0.1\n \n30\n \n0.4\n \nValuation allowance releases\n(\n939\n)\n(\n6.9\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n664\n)\n(\n9.0\n)\nOther\n(\n34\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\n(\n29\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\nEffective tax rate\n$\n2,394\n \n17.5\n \n%\n$\n2,798\n \n25.6\n \n%\n$\n1,625\n \n22.0\n \n%\nThe tax provision in 2024 included tax benefits of $\n939\n million due primarily to the release of valuation allowances recorded against a deferred tax asset related to our JUUL-related losses as a result of the IRS Agreement and the ABI Transaction, partially offset by state tax expense, net of federal benefit, of $\n557\n million.\nThe tax provision in 2023 included state tax expense, net of federal benefit, of $\n463\n million and tax expense of $\n53\n million for a valuation allowance recorded against a deferred tax asset related to the disposition of our former investment in JUUL.\nThe tax provision in 2022 included tax benefits of $\n664\n million due primarily to the release of valuation allowances related to the anticipated ability to utilize a portion of existing capital losses.

We had estimated gross federal, state and foreign tax net operating losses (“NOLs”) of $\n374\n million, $\n1,066\n million and $\n38\n million, respectively.  The federal NOLs, a majority of the state NOLs and the foreign NOLs have indefinite carryforward periods.\nAfter giving effect to the IRS Agreement and $\n1.7\n billion of JUUL-related capital losses previously utilized against capital gains related to the \nIQOS\n Transaction, we have $\n5.7\n billion (which includes a $\n3.5\n billion outside basis difference in a domestic subsidiary, a $\n1.2\n billion outside basis difference in a foreign subsidiary and $\n1.0\n billion of capital loss carryforwards) of the $\n12.8\n billion tax loss related to our former investment in JUUL remaining to offset future potential capital gains.  For financial statement purposes, none of the tax benefit for the remaining $\n5.7\n billion was recognized at December 31, 2024.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending valuation allowances was as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n2,256\n \n$\n2,800\n \n$\n3,097\n \nAdditions to valuation allowance charged to income tax expense\n244\n \n114\n \n429\n \nReductions to valuation allowance credited to income tax benefit\n(\n1,337\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n730\n)\n(Reductions) additions to valuation allowance due to NJOY Transaction (no impact to earnings)\n(\n4\n)\n12\n \n—\n \nReductions to valuation allowance offset to deferred tax asset (no impact to earnings)\n(\n491\n)\n(\n663\n)\n—\n \nForeign currency translation\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n4\n \nBalance at end of year\n$\n668\n \n$\n2,256\n \n$\n2,800\n \nWe determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  We determine the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence.  In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.  As has occurred in prior periods, there is a potential that sufficient positive evidence may be available in future periods to cause us to reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.  That change to the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets and a decrease in income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.\nThe additions to valuation allowances during 2024 were due primarily to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our JUUL-related capital loss carryforwards.  The reductions to valuation allowances during 2024 were due primarily to the $\n4.0\n billion of ordinary losses recognized as part of the IRS Agreement, the reduction of a deferred tax asset for the portion of our JUUL-related capital losses that is now part of our tax basis in the shares of a domestic subsidiary and the ABI Transaction.  This outside basis difference of the domestic subsidiary is not recognized as a deferred tax asset since we do not expect the temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future.  The cumulative valuation allowance at December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our investment in Cronos ($\n402\n million) and our JUUL-related capital loss carryforwards ($\n207\n million).\nThe additions to valuation allowances during 2023 were due primarily to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our former investment in JUUL.  The reductions to valuation allowances during 2023 were due primarily to the reduction of a deferred tax asset for the portion of our JUUL capital losses that is now part of our tax basis in the shares of a foreign subsidiary.  This outside basis difference of the foreign subsidiary is not recognized as a deferred tax asset since we do not expect the temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future.  The cumulative valuation allowance at December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our tax basis in the shares of a domestic subsidiary ($\n1,808\n million) and our investment in Cronos ($\n397\n million).\nThe additions to valuation allowances during 2022 were due primarily to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with decreases in the estimated fair value of our former investment in JUUL.  The reductions to valuation allowances during 2022 were due primarily to the anticipated ability to utilize a portion of existing losses related to our former investment in JUUL and the abandonment of our Cronos warrant.  The cumulative valuation allowance at December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with our former investment in JUUL ($\n2,394\n million) and our investment in Cronos ($\n379\n million).\nFor a discussion regarding our former investment in JUUL and current investments in ABI and Cronos, see Note 8. \nInvestments in Equity Securities\n.\n81\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nNote 17.  \nSegment Reporting\nAt December 31, 2024, our reportable segments were (i) smokeable products, consisting of combustible cigarettes and machine-made large cigars; and (ii) oral tobacco products, consisting of MST products and oral nicotine pouches.\nOur all other category included (i) NJOY (beginning June 1, 2023); (ii) Horizon; (iii) Helix International; and (iv) other business activities, all of which consists of research and development (“R&D”) expense related to certain new product platforms and technologies.\nOur chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is Altria’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews operating companies income (loss) (“OCI”) to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, our segments.  OCI for our segments is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles.  Our CODM uses OCI for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance of the segments, including allocating capital and other resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.  Interest and other debt expense, net, along with net periodic benefit income, excluding service cost, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed at the corporate level and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our CODM.

The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, for our pension plans was $\n5.9\n billion and $\n6.3\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nActuarial gains for our pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2024 were due primarily to a higher discount rate.  Actuarial gains for our postretirement plans for the year ended December 31, 2024 were due primarily to lower assumed health care plans participation rates and a higher discount rate.  Actuarial losses for our pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2023 were due primarily to a lower discount rate.  Actuarial gains for our postretirement plans for the year ended December 31, 2023 were due primarily to a planned change in healthcare provider effective January 2025, and other items, partially offset by actuarial losses attributable to a lower discount rate.\nFor pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, our accumulated benefit obligation was $\n140\n million and $\n142\n million, respectively.  For pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, our projected benefit obligation was $\n161\n million and $\n159\n million, respectively.

Contributions and costs are determined generally as a percentage of earnings, as defined by our plans.  Amounts charged to expense for these defined contribution plans totaled $\n112\n million, $\n109\n million and $\n91\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n▪\nPension and Postretirement Plan Assets: \nIn managing our pension assets, we implement a liability-driven investment framework that aligns plan assets with liabilities.  The current equity/fixed income target allocation of \n20\n%/\n80\n% is designed to balance pension liability hedging and asset growth in order to maintain our plan’s funded status and cover incremental service accruals and interest cost.  Liability hedging is achieved through investing in rate-sensitive fixed income securities, primarily corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries, while growth assets are comprised of publicly traded equity securities.\nOur investment strategy for our postretirement plan assets is intended to maximize our total asset return based on the expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term and reflects the maturity structure of our benefit obligation.  The equity/fixed income target allocation for postretirement plan assets is \n55\n%/\n45\n%.\nWe believe that we implement these investment strategies in a prudent and risk-controlled manner, consistent with the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, by investing retirement plan assets in a well-diversified mix of equities, fixed income and other securities.\nThe actual composition of our plan assets at December 31, 2024 was broadly characterized with the following allocation:\nPension\nPostretirement\nEquity securities\n21\n \n%\n57\n \n%\nCorporate bonds\n63\n \n%\n30\n \n%\nU.S. Treasury and foreign government securities and all other investments \n16\n \n%\n(1)\n13\n \n%\n(1)  \nAmount includes U.S. Treasury and foreign government securities (\n8\n%) and all other investments (\n8\n%).\nOur pension and postretirement plan asset performance is monitored on an ongoing basis to adjust the mix as necessary to achieve our target allocations.\nSubstantially all pension and all postretirement assets can be used to make monthly benefit payments.\nWe implement our investment strategy for our pension and postretirement plan assets by investing in long-duration fixed income securities that primarily include U.S. corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and U.S. Treasury securities that mirror  our pension obligation benchmark, as well as U.S. and international equity index strategies that are intended to mirror broad market \n86\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nindices, including, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and Morgan Stanley Capital International (“MSCI”) Europe, Australasia, and the Far East (“EAFE”) Index.  Our pension and postretirement plans also invest in actively managed international equity securities of mid- and small-cap companies located in developed and emerging markets.  For pension plan assets, our allocation to below investment grade securities represented approximately \n8\n% of the fixed income holdings or approximately \n7\n% of our total plan assets at December 31, 2024.  Our allocation to emerging markets represented approximately \n2\n% of total plan assets at December 31, 2024.  For postretirement plan assets, our allocation to below investment grade securities represented approximately \n8\n% of the fixed income holdings or approximately \n3\n% of our total plan assets at December 31, 2024.  Our allocation to emerging markets represented approximately \n2\n% of our total plan assets at December 31, 2024.\nOur risk management practices for our pension and postretirement plans include (i) ongoing monitoring of asset allocation, investment performance and investment managers’ compliance with their investment guidelines, (ii) periodic rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes and (iii) annual actuarial re-measurement of plan liabilities.\nOur expected rate of return on pension and postretirement plan assets is determined by our plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.  The forward-looking estimates are consistent with the long-term historical averages exhibited by returns on equity and fixed income securities.  For determining our pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (income), our 2025 expected rate of return assumptions are \n6.1\n% and \n7.4\n%, respectively.\nThe fair values of our pension plan assets by asset category were as follows at December 31:\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nTotal\nU.S. and foreign government securities or their agencies:\nU.S. government and agencies\n$\n—\n \n$\n508\n \n$\n508\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,114\n \n$\n1,114\n \nU.S. municipal bonds\n—\n \n69\n \n69\n \n—\n \n81\n \n81\n \nForeign government and agencies\n—\n \n54\n \n54\n \n—\n \n33\n \n33\n \nCorporate debt instruments:\nAbove investment grade\n—\n \n3,572\n \n3,572\n \n—\n \n3,160\n \n3,160\n \nBelow investment grade and no rating\n—\n \n582\n \n582\n \n—\n \n716\n \n716\n \nCommon stock:\nInternational equities\n398\n \n—\n \n398\n \n360\n \n—\n \n360\n \nU.S. equities\n361\n \n—\n \n361\n \n323\n \n—\n \n323\n \nAsset backed securities\n—\n \n185\n \n185\n \n—\n \n279\n \n279\n \nOther, net\n(\n15\n)\n99\n \n84\n \n47\n \n154\n \n201\n \n$\n744\n \n$\n5,069\n \n$\n5,813\n \n$\n730\n \n$\n5,537\n \n$\n6,267\n \nInvestments measured at NAV as a practical expedient for fair value:\nCollective investment funds\nU.S. large cap\n$\n445\n \n$\n388\n \nU.S. small cap\n \n100\n \n90\n \nInternational developed markets\n53\n \n55\n \nTotal investments measured at NAV\n$\n598\n \n$\n533\n \nOther\n134\n \n(\n25\n)\nFair value of plan assets, net\n$\n6,545\n \n$\n6,775\n \nLevel 3 holdings and transactions were immaterial to total plan assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n87\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nThe fair values of our postretirement plan assets were as follows at December 31:\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nTotal\nU.S. and foreign government securities or their agencies:\nU.S. government and agencies\n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n4\n \nForeign government and agencies\n—\n \n2\n \n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \n2\n \nCorporate debt instruments:\nAbove investment grade\n—\n \n24\n \n24\n \n—\n \n31\n \n31\n \nBelow investment grade and no rating\n—\n \n2\n \n2\n \n—\n \n4\n \n4\n \nOther, net\n—\n \n8\n \n8\n \n1\n \n3\n \n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n44\n \n$\n45\n \nInvestments measured at NAV as a practical expedient for fair value:\nCollective investment funds:\nU.S. large cap\n$\n35\n \n$\n44\n \nInternational developed markets\n12\n \n11\n \nTotal investments measured at NAV\n$\n47\n \n$\n55\n \nOther\n—\n \n2\n \nFair value of plan assets, net\n$\n84\n \n$\n102\n \nThere were no Level 3 postretirement plan holdings or transactions during 2024 and 2023.\nFor a description of the fair value hierarchy and the three levels of inputs used to measure fair value, see Note 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n▪\nU.S. and Foreign Government Securities\n: U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities, agency bonds and municipal securities.  Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes.  Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n▪\nCorporate Debt Instruments\n: Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes.  Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n▪\nCommon Stock\n: Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n▪\nAsset Backed Securities\n: Asset backed securities are fixed income securities such as mortgage backed securities and auto loans that are collateralized by pools of underlying assets that are unable to be sold individually.  They are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active over-the-counter market.\n▪\nCollective Investment Funds\n: Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index.  They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds, which are valued based on the net asset value (“NAV”), and are provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value.  These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\nCash Flows: \nWe make contributions to our pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pay benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations.  Currently, we anticipate making employer contributions to our pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $\n30\n million\n for each i\nn 2025.  However, the foregoing  estimates of 2025 contributions to our pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n88\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31,

Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, unfair trade practices, antitrust, income tax liability, contraband shipments, patent infringement, employment matters, environmental matters, claims alleging violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), claims for contribution and claims of competitors, shareholders or distributors.  Legislative action, such as changes to tort law, also may expand the types of claims and remedies available to plaintiffs.\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty, and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases.  An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.  Damages claimed in some tobacco-related and other litigation are or can be significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions of dollars.  The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrates that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.  In certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several.  In such cases, we may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment.  As a result, under certain circumstances, we may have to pay more than our proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts.  Furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, we also may be required to pay interest and attorneys’ fees.\nAlthough PM USA historically has been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases.  This risk has been substantially reduced given that \n47\n states and Puerto Rico limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all.  However, tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida’s bond cap statute in several cases, and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well.  Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court.  States, including Florida, also may seek to repeal or alter bond cap statutes through legislation.  Although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.\nWe record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed elsewhere in this Note 20. \nContingencies\n: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.  Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe have achieved substantial success in managing litigation.  Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain.  It is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation.  We believe, and have been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts.  We have defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges.  However, we may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\n91\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nJudgments Paid and Provisions for Tobacco and Health (Including \nEngle\n Progeny Litigation) and Certain Other Litigation Items: \nThe changes in our accrued liability for tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, including related interest costs, for the periods specified below are as follows:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAccrued liability for tobacco and health and certain other litigation items at beginning of period\n$\n346\n \n$\n71\n \n$\n91\n \nPre-tax charges for:\nTobacco and health and certain other litigation \n(1)\n70\n \n79\n \n101\n \nShareholder derivative lawsuits \n(2)\n—\n \n98\n \n27\n \nJUUL-related settlements \n(3)\n30\n \n242\n \n—\n \nRelated interest costs\n1\n \n11\n \n3\n \nPayments\n(\n351\n)\n(\n155\n)\n(\n151\n)\nAccrued liability for tobacco and health and certain other litigation items at end of period\n$\n96\n \n$\n346\n \n$\n71\n \n(1)\n Includes judgments, settlements and fee disputes associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation.\n(2)\n See\n Federal and State Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits\n below for a discussion of the settlement of the federal and state shareholder derivative lawsuits.\n(3)\n Includes the settlement of certain e-vapor product litigation relating to JUUL e-vapor products.

Pre-tax charges except for related interest costs were included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.  Pre-tax charges for related interest costs were included in interest and other debt expense, net in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nAfter exhausting all appeals in those cases resulting in adverse verdicts associated with tobacco-related litigation, since October 2004, PM USA has paid judgments and settlements (including related costs and fees) totaling approximately $\n1.1\n billion and interest totaling approximately $\n242\n million as of December 31, 2024.  These amounts include payments for \nEngle\n progeny judgments (and related costs and fees) totaling approximately $\n449\n million and related interest totaling approximately $\n61\n million.\nSecurity for Judgments: \nTo obtain stays of judgments pending appeal, PM USA has posted various forms of security.  As of December 31, 2024, PM USA has posted appeal bonds totaling approximately $\n31\n million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash and are included in assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOverview of Tobacco-Related Litigation\nTypes and Number of U.S. Cases: \nClaims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories: (i) smoking and health cases alleging personal injury brought on behalf of individual plaintiffs; (ii) health care cost recovery cases brought by governmental (both domestic and foreign) plaintiffs seeking reimbursement for health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking and/or disgorgement of profits; (iii) e-vapor cases alleging violation of RICO, fraud, failure to warn, design defect, negligence, antitrust, patent infringement and unfair trade practices; and (iv) other tobacco-related litigation described below.

Plaintiffs in the smoking and health cases seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, treble/multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, creation of medical monitoring and smoking cessation funds, disgorgement of profits, and injunctive and equitable relief.  Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, comparative fault and/or contributory negligence, statutes of limitations and preemption by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.\nNon-\nEngle\n Progeny Litigation: \nSummarized below are the non-\nEngle \nprogeny smoking and health cases pending in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiff and against PM USA and remain outstanding or cases concluded within the last 12 months where PM USA paid a final judgment.  Charts listing certain verdicts for plaintiffs in the \nEngle \nprogeny cases can be found in \nSmoking and Health Litigation - Engle Progeny Trial Results\n below.\nTaylor\n: In April 2024, a jury in an Oregon state court returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against PM USA, awarding less than $\n1\n million in compensatory damages.  The jury found that plaintiff was not entitled to punitive damages.  Plaintiff has appealed the judgment, and the appeal remains pending.  PM USA filed post-trial motions, which were denied, and PM USA has noticed an appeal from the final judgment and the trial court’s denial of the post-trial motions.  The parties filed a motion to stay execution pending appeal, and the court has stayed execution of the final judgment pending conclusion of appellate activity.\nRicapor-Hall\n: In August 2023, a jury in a Hawaii state court returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against PM USA, awarding $\n6\n million in compensatory damages and $\n8\n million in punitive damages.  In October 2023, the court entered judgment against PM USA for $\n11\n million, having reduced the compensatory damages award to $\n3\n million based on the jury’s finding on comparative fault and a set-off against plaintiff’s settlements with other defendants.  We filed post-trial motions challenging the verdict, which were denied in \n93\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nMarch 2024.  In April 2024, we filed a notice of appeal and a motion to stay execution pending appeal, and the court has stayed execution of the final judgment pending resolution of PM USA’s appeal rights.  PM USA’s appeal remains pending, and plaintiff has noticed a cross-appeal.\nWoodley\n:\n \nIn February 2023, a jury in a Massachusetts state court returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against PM USA, awarding $\n5\n million in compensatory damages.  There was \nno\n claim for punitive damages.  Following the denial of PM USA’s post-trial motions, PM USA appealed the judgment to the Appeals Court of Massachusetts, which affirmed the judgment in January 2025.\nFontaine\n:\n \nIn September 2022, a jury in a Massachusetts state court returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against PM USA, awarding approximately $\n8\n million in compensatory damages and $\n1\n billion in punitive damages.  In September 2023, the court denied PM USA’s motion for a new trial and partially granted PM USA’s motion for remittitur, reducing the punitive damages award to $\n56\n million.  In December 2023, the court entered a final judgment awarding plaintiff $\n8\n million in compensatory damages, $\n56\n million in punitive damages and prejudgment interest.  PM USA has noticed an appeal to the Appeals Court of Massachusetts, and the appeal remains pending.\nFederal Government’s Lawsuit\n:\n \nSee \nHealth Care Cost Recovery Litigation - Federal Government’s Lawsuit\n below for a discussion of the verdict and post-trial developments in the United States of America health care cost recovery case.\nEngle\n Progeny Cases: \nEngle\n progeny cases are individual smoking and health lawsuits filed by Florida resident plaintiffs against one or more cigarette manufacturer defendants.  The lawsuits arose following the Florida Supreme Court’s decertification of the class in \nEngle, et. al. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et. al.\n, a smoking and health class action lawsuit filed in Florida state court against multiple defendants, including PM USA, in which the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff class and the trial court assessed punitive damages against the defendants.  In July 2006, the Florida Supreme Court mandated that the trial court’s punitive damages award be vacated, that the class approved by the trial court be decertified and that members of the decertified class could file individual actions against defendants within one year of issuance of the mandate.  Plaintiffs in \nEngle \nprogeny lawsuits are entitled to rely on certain liability findings from the class action lawsuit, substantially reducing each plaintiff’s burden of proof.  These liability findings stipulate: (i) that smoking causes various diseases; (ii) that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive; (iii) that defendants’ cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous; (iv) that defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking; (v) that defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment; (vi) that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective; and (vii) that defendants were negligent.\nPending \nEngl\ne Progeny Cases: \nThe deadline for filing \nEngle\n progeny cases expired in January 2008, at which point a total of approximately \n9,300\n federal and state claims were pending.  As of January 27, 2025, approximately \n105\n state court cases were pending against PM USA or Altria asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately \n132\n state court plaintiffs.  Because of a number of factors, including docketing delays, duplicated filings and overlapping dismissal orders, these numbers are estimates.  Each federal \nEngle\n progeny case has been resolved.\nEngle\n Progeny Trial Results: \nAs of January 27, 2025, \n147\n federal and state \nEngle\n progeny cases involving PM USA have resulted in verdicts.  \nEighty-eight\n were returned in favor of plaintiffs, \nfive\n of which have been reversed post-trial or on appeal and remain pending.  \nFifty-nine\n verdicts were returned in favor of PM USA, \ntwo\n of which have been reversed post-trial or on appeal and remain pending.  In addition, there have been a number of mistrials, only some of which have resulted in new trials as of January 27, 2025.\nPost-trial activity in a case can result in a final resolution that differs from the initial verdict.  In many cases, parties have appealed either compensatory or punitive damages awards or both.  Courts also have increased and decreased the amounts of compensatory damages juries have awarded, decreased the amounts of punitive damages juries have awarded, declared mistrials and vacated judgments, in whole or in part, with respect to compensatory and punitive damages awards.  Initial verdicts have been reversed in whole or in part on appeal or following retrial.  Juries have returned verdicts in favor of or against PM USA awarding no damages.  In cases where juries returned verdicts against PM USA awarding no damages, some trial courts have decided to award plaintiff damages notwithstanding the verdict.  Cases also have been dismissed with or without prejudice before or after a verdict.\nThe charts below list the verdicts in and post-trial status of certain Engle progeny cases in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs.  The first chart lists cases that are pending as of January 27, 2025 where PM USA has determined an unfavorable outcome is not probable and the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, and the second chart lists cases that have concluded in the past 12 months.  In this Note 20. \nContingencies\n, references to “R.J. Reynolds” are to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  Unless otherwise noted for a particular case, the jury’s award for compensatory damages will not be reduced by any finding of plaintiff’s comparative fault.

In general, these cases have purported to be brought on behalf of residents of a particular state or states (although a few cases have purported to be nationwide in scope) and have raised addiction claims and, in many cases, claims of physical injury as well.\nClass certification has been denied or reversed by courts in \n61\n smoking and health class actions involving PM USA in Arkansas (\n1\n), California (\n1\n), Delaware (\n1\n), the District of Columbia (\n2\n), Florida (\n2\n), Illinois (\n3\n), Iowa (\n1\n), Kansas (\n1\n), Louisiana (\n1\n), Maryland (\n1\n), Michigan (\n1\n), Minnesota (\n1\n), Nevada (\n29\n), New Jersey (\n6\n), New York (\n2\n), Ohio (\n1\n), Oklahoma (\n1\n), Oregon (\n1\n), Pennsylvania (\n1\n), Puerto Rico (\n1\n), South Carolina (\n1\n), Texas (\n1\n) and Wisconsin (\n1\n).  See \nCertain Other Tobacco-Related Litigation \nbelow for a discussion of “Lights” and “Ultra Lights” class action cases and medical monitoring class action cases pending against PM USA.\nAs of January 27, 2025, PM USA and Altria are named as defendants, along with other cigarette manufacturers, in \nseven\n class actions filed in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Ontario.  In Saskatchewan, British Columbia (\ntwo\n separate cases) and Ontario, plaintiffs seek class certification on behalf of individuals who suffer or have suffered from various diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, heart disease or cancer, after smoking defendants’ cigarettes.  In the actions filed in Alberta, Manitoba and Nova Scotia, plaintiffs seek certification of classes of all individuals who smoked defendants’ cigarettes.  In March 2019, all of these class actions were stayed as a result of \nthree\n Canadian tobacco manufacturers (\nno\nne of which is related to us) seeking protection under Canada’s Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (which is similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States).  The companies entered into these proceedings following a Canadian appellate court upholding \ntwo\n smoking and health class action verdicts against those companies totaling approximately CAD $\n13\n billion.  See \nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters\n below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria and PMI, which provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products.\nAs of January 27, 2025, PM USA is named as a defendant in \n24\n cases brought by flight attendants against United States cigarette manufacturers seeking compensatory damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”).  The flight attendants allege that they are members of an ETS smoking and health class action in Florida that was settled in 1997 (\nBroin\n).  The terms of the court-approved settlement in that case allowed class members to file individual lawsuits seeking compensatory damages but prohibited them from seeking punitive damages.  Class members were prohibited from filing individual lawsuits after 2000 under the court-approved settlement.  In July 2024, we reached agreement on terms to resolve approximately \n627\n \n95\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nindividual \nBroin\n lawsuits.  Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a pre-tax provision of $\n4\n million related to the settlement of these cases, which we paid in the third quarter of 2024.\nHealth Care Cost Recovery Litigation\nOverview: \nIn the health care cost recovery litigation, governmental entities seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and, in some cases, of future expenditures and damages.  Relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages, multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors, disclosure of research, disgorgement of profits, funding of anti-smoking programs, additional disclosure of nicotine yields, and payment of attorney and expert witness fees.\nAlthough there have been some decisions to the contrary, most judicial decisions in the United States have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers.  \nNine\n federal circuit courts of appeals and \neight\n state appellate courts, relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote, have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions.  The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five federal circuit courts of appeal.\nIn addition to the cases brought in the United States, health care cost recovery actions have been brought against tobacco industry participants, including PM USA and Altria, in Canada (\n10\n cases), and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions.\nSince the beginning of 2008, the Canadian Provinces of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia have brought health care reimbursement claims against cigarette manufacturers.  PM USA is named as a defendant in the British Columbia and Quebec cases, while both Altria and PM USA are named as defendants in the New Brunswick, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia cases.  The Nunavut Territory and Northwest Territory have passed legislation permitting similar claims, but lawsuits based on this legislation have not been filed.  All of these cases have been stayed pending resolution of proceedings in Canada involving \nthree\n tobacco manufacturers (none of which are affiliated with us) under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act discussed above.  See \nSmoking and Health Litigation - Other Smoking and Health Class Actions\n above for a discussion of these proceedings.  See \nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters\n below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products.\nSettlements of Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation: \nIn November 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (the “MSA”) with \n46\n states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims.  PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, the “State Settlement Agreements”).  The State Settlement Agreements require that the original participating manufacturers or “OPMs” (now PM USA, R.J. Reynolds and, with respect to certain brands, ITG Brands, LLC (“ITG”)) make annual payments of approximately $\n10.4\n billion, subject to adjustments for several factors, including inflation, market share and industry volume.  The OPMs’ obligation to make quarterly payments settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, subject to an annual cap of $\n500\n million, on a pro rata basis based on market share, ended in the fourth quarter of 2024.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate amount recorded in cost of sales with respect to the State Settlement Agreements was approximately $\n3.5\n billion, $\n3.7\n billion and $\n3.9\n billion, respectively.  These amounts include PM USA’s estimate of amounts related to NPM Adjustments discussed below.\nNon-Participating Manufacturer (“NPM”) Adjustment Disputes: \nThe “NPM Adjustment” is a reduction in MSA payments made by the OPMs and those manufacturers that are subsequent signatories to the MSA (collectively, the “participating manufacturers” or “PMs”) that applies if the PMs collectively lose at least a specified level of market share to non-participating manufacturers since 1997, subject to certain conditions and defenses.  The applicability of this reduction has been subject to certain disputes, some of which have been resolved via settlement, as discussed below.\nSettlements of NPM Adjustment Disputes\n.\n▪\nMulti-State Settlement\n.  As of January 2022, a total of \n36\n states and territories had settled NPM Adjustment disputes relating to varying periods of time.  In March 2022, August 2023 and February 2024, Illinois, Iowa and Idaho, respectively, joined the multi-state settlement, bringing the total number of states and territories that have joined the multi-state settlement to \n39\n.  In the first quarter of 2022, PM USA recorded $\n80\n million, $\n20\n million of which related to the 2019 through 2021 “transition years,” as a reduction in cost of sales as a result of Illinois joining the multi-state settlement.  As a result of Iowa joining the multi-state settlement, PM USA will receive approximately $\n19\n million for 2005 through 2022, $\n4\n million of which relates to the 2020 through 2022 “transition years.”  Accordingly, PM USA recorded $\n19\n million as a reduction in cost of sales in the third quarter of 2023.  As a result of Idaho joining the multi-state settlement, PM USA will receive approximately $\n8\n million for 2005 through 2023, $\n2\n million of which relates to the 2021 through 2023 “transition years.”  In connection with this development, PM USA recorded $\n8\n million as a reduction in cost of sales in the first quarter of 2024.  Pursuant to the multi-state settlement, PM USA has received \n96\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\n$\n1.37\n billion since the first group of states entered the NPM Adjustment dispute settlement in 2014 and expects to receive annual credits applied against PM USA’s MSA payments through 2041.\n▪\nNew York Settlement.  \nIn 2015, PM USA entered into a separate NPM Adjustment settlement in which PM USA settled the NPM Adjustment disputes with New York in perpetuity.  PM USA has received $\n572\n million pursuant to the New York settlement and expects to receive annual credits applied against the MSA payments due to New York going forward.\n▪\nMontana Settlement\n.  In 2020, PM USA entered into a separate NPM Adjustment settlement in which PM USA settled the NPM Adjustment disputes with Montana through 2030, resulting in a payment from PM USA to Montana for an immaterial amount.\n▪\nMassachusetts Settlement\n.  In 2024, PM USA entered into a separate NPM Adjustment settlement in which PM USA settled the NPM Adjustment disputes with Massachusetts through 2011.  As a result of this settlement, PM USA will receive $\n28\n million.  Accordingly, PM USA recorded $\n28\n million as a reduction in costs of sales in the third quarter of 2024.\nContinuing NPM Adjustment Disputes with States That Have Not Settled\n.\n▪\n2004 NPM Adjustment.\n  The PMs and the \nnine\n states that had not settled the NPM Adjustment disputes for 2004 participated in a multi-state arbitration.  Iowa subsequently joined the multistate settlement in August 2023.  The arbitration panel found \nthree\n of the remaining \neight\n states that have not settled the NPM Adjustment disputes, Washington, Missouri and New Mexico, were not diligent in the enforcement of their escrow statutes in 2004, and PM USA received approximately $\n52\n million on account of the 2004 NPM Adjustment as a credit against its April 2023 MSA payment.  PM USA recorded $\n44\n million and $\n8\n million in third quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.  Washington, Missouri and New Mexico have challenged those determinations in their respective state courts, and several issues remain to be resolved by the state trial and appellate courts that may affect the final amount of the 2004 NPM adjustment PM USA and other PMs will receive.\n▪\n2005-2007 NPM Adjustments.\n  The PMs and the \nsix\n states that have not settled the NPM Adjustment disputes are currently arbitrating NPM Adjustment disputes before a single arbitration panel.  The arbitration encompasses \nthree years\n, 2005 through 2007, for \nfive\n of the \nsix\n states, and \none year\n, 2005, for \none\n state.  As of January 27, 2025, the arbitration panel had issued decisions for Maryland, Washington and Wisconsin, finding Maryland and Wisconsin diligent for all \nthree years\n and Washington not diligent for all \nthree years\n.  Washington challenged that determination in Washington state court, and the challenge was denied by the trial court.  Washington has appealed that denial, and the appeal remains pending.  PM USA recorded $\n14\n million as a reduction of costs of sales and $\n21\n million as interest income in the fourth quarter of 2023 for its estimate of the minimum amount of the 2005 through 2007 NPM Adjustment it will receive.\n▪\nSubsequent Years.  \nNo assurance can be given as to when proceedings for 2008 and subsequent years will be scheduled or the precise form those proceedings will take.\nOther Disputes under the State Settlement Agreements: \nThe payment obligations of the tobacco product manufacturers that are parties to the State Settlement Agreements, as well as the allocations of any NPM Adjustments and related settlements, have been and may continue to be affected by R.J. Reynolds’s acquisition of Lorillard Tobacco Company in 2015 and its related sale of certain cigarette brands to ITG (the “ITG transferred brands”).  PM USA continues to dispute how the ITG transferred brands are treated in allocating the NPM Adjustments and profit adjustments under the State Settlement Agreements.\nIn December 2019, the State of Mississippi filed a motion in Mississippi state court seeking to enforce the Mississippi State Settlement Agreement against PM USA, R.J. Reynolds and ITG concerning the tax rates used in the annual calculation of the net operating profit adjustment payments starting in 2018.  The Mississippi state court held a hearing in October 2021 and issued a decision in June 2022 granting the State’s motion.  PM USA appealed the court’s decision in June 2024.  In September 2024, PM USA and Mississippi settled their dispute over the profit adjustment payments.  Pursuant to the settlement, PM USA paid $\n7\n million to Mississippi for 2018 through 2023.  Accordingly, PM USA recorded $\n5\n million of expense to cost of sales and $\n2\n million of interest expense in the third quarter of 2024.\nIn May 2023, PM USA and R.J. Reynolds filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas seeking to enforce the Texas State Settlement Agreement against the State of Texas concerning the same tax rate issue raised by the State of Mississippi.  The State of Texas filed a cross-motion to enforce, and the court found in favor of the State of Texas.  As of January 27, 2025, the court had not made a determination on damages.  PM USA intends to appeal.\nIn July 2024, the State of Minnesota filed a motion in Minnesota state court seeking to enforce the Minnesota State Settlement Agreement against PM USA, R.J. Reynolds and ITG concerning the same state tax issues raised by Mississippi and Texas.  The court found in favor of the State of Minnesota.  As of January 27, 2025, the court had not made a determination on damages.  PM USA intends to appeal.\nFederal Government’s Lawsuit: \nIn 1999, the U.S. government filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against various cigarette manufacturers, including PM USA, and others, including Altria, asserting claims under three federal statutes.  The case ultimately proceeded only under the civil provisions of RICO.  In August 2006, the district court held that certain defendants, including Altria and PM USA, violated RICO and engaged in certain “sub-schemes” to defraud that the government had alleged.\n97\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nThe court did not impose monetary penalties on defendants, but ordered various types of non-monetary relief, including an injunction against conveying any express or implied health message or health descriptors on cigarette packaging or in cigarette advertising or promotional material, including “lights,” “ultra lights” and “low tar,” which the court found could cause consumers to believe one cigarette brand is less hazardous than another brand, and the issuance of “corrective statements” in various media regarding the adverse health effects of smoking, the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine, the lack of any significant health benefit from smoking “low tar” or “light” cigarettes, defendants’ manipulation of cigarette design to ensure optimum nicotine delivery and the adverse health effects of exposure to ETS.\nCorrective statements appeared in newspapers and on television for \nfour months\n and \none year\n, respectively, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the onserts appeared for two weeks at a time for a total of twelve weeks over \ntwo years\n beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Corrective statements have appeared on websites since the second quarter of 2018.  In December 2022, the district court entered a consent order approving a settlement with respect to corrective statements on point-of-sale signage.  In addition to the $\n28\n million of provisions recorded in 2022, we recorded in the first quarter of 2024 provisions of $\n15\n million for estimated costs of implementing the corrective statements on point-of-sale signage remedy.\nIn May 2024, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. government resolving its concerns regarding our assignment of the exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to the \nIQOS\n System to PMI and whether the court-ordered injunction that applies to cigarettes discussed above also applies to \nHeatSticks,\n a heated tobacco product used with the \nIQOS\n System.  Under the agreement, PM USA agreed to obtain district court approval for any future similar transaction and to post additional point-of-sale signage containing the corrective statements referenced above.  The cost of implementing the additional point-of-sale signage did not require an increase to the previously recorded provisions for point-of-sale signage discussed above.  Pursuant to the settlement, PM USA voluntarily dismissed its appeal of the district court’s ruling that \nHeatSticks\n are subject to the court’s injunction.\nE-vapor Product Litigation\nWe have been named as defendants in federal class action lawsuits, individual lawsuits and “third party” lawsuits relating to JUUL e-vapor products, which include school districts, state and local governments and tribal and healthcare organization lawsuits.  We refer to this litigation in the United States collectively as the “Multidistrict Litigation.”  The theories of recovery in the Multidistrict Litigation include violation of RICO, fraud, failure to warn, design defect, negligence, public nuisance and unfair trade practices.  Plaintiffs seek various remedies, including compensatory and punitive damages, restitution or remediation (for plaintiffs that are government entities) and an injunction prohibiting product sales.  We also have been named as defendants in a group of cases pending in a consolidated California state court proceeding.\nIn May 2023, we reached agreement on terms to resolve the majority of the Multidistrict Litigation lawsuits as well as the majority of the group of cases pending in a consolidated California state court proceeding for $\n235\n million, for which amount we recorded a pre-tax provision in the second quarter of 2023.  In March 2024, the court granted final approval of the class action settlement, and we paid the settlement amount in the second quarter of 2024.  The settlement applies to all of the Multidistrict Litigation except \n20\n individual cases that opted out of the settlement and \n38\n “third party” cases brought by Native American tribes.  We separately agreed to settle the cases brought by Native America tribes in July 2024, and these cases have been dismissed.  We recorded a pre-tax provision for $\n20\n million in the second quarter of 2024 related to the settlement and paid the settlement amount in October 2024.  Neither settlement applies to \nthree\n class action lawsuits pending in Canada, the cases brought by state attorneys general, discussed below, or \n17\n putative class action antitrust lawsuits.  For a description of the antitrust cases not subject to the settlement, see \nAntitrust Litigation\n below.\nFour\n of the “third party” lawsuits noted above against us and JUUL were initiated, individually, by the attorneys general of Alaska, Hawaii, Minnesota and New Mexico alleging violations of state consumer protection and other similar laws.  In April 2023, January 2024, February 2024 and April 2024, we agreed to settle the Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico lawsuits, respectively, for immaterial amounts.\nIn May 2023, Fuma International LLC (“Fuma”) filed a lawsuit against Altria and our affiliates Nu Mark LLC (“Nu Mark”), AGDC, ALCS and NJOY in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia asserting claims of patent infringement based on the sale of various Nu Mark and NJOY products, including \nNJOY ACE\n, in the United States.  In August 2023, we entered into an agreement with Fuma resulting in NJOY’s acquisition of the patents that Fuma asserted in its lawsuit.  The parties separately agreed that Fuma would dismiss its patent infringement claims in exchange for $\n10\n million, and such claims were dismissed in August 2023.  We recorded a pre-tax provision for $\n10\n million in the third quarter of 2023 related to the agreement and paid such amount to Fuma in August 2023.\nIn June 2023, JUUL and VMR Products LLC (“VMR”) filed a lawsuit against Altria and our affiliates AGDC, ALCS, NJOY Holdings and NJOY in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona asserting claims of patent infringement based on the sale of \nNJOY ACE \nin the United States.  Plaintiffs seek various remedies, including damages and an injunction on sales of \nNJOY ACE\n.  The lawsuit is currently stayed.\nAlso in June 2023, the same plaintiffs filed a related action against the same defendants with the ITC.  There, the plaintiffs also allege patent infringement, but the remedies sought include an exclusion order that would prohibit the importation of \nNJOY ACE\n into the United States.  \nNo\n damages are recoverable in the proceedings before the ITC.  A hearing before the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) \n98\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nwas held in May 2024, and, in August 2024, the ALJ issued an initial determination supporting the plaintiffs’ allegations with respect to \nfour\n patents and recommending an exclusion order.  In September 2024, NJOY petitioned the ITC to review the ALJ’s initial determination.  In October 2024, the ITC granted review of the ALJ’s initial determination with respect to aspects of \ntwo\n of the \nfour\n patents.  On January 29, 2025, the ITC issued its final determination finding that \nNJOY ACE\n infringes the \nfour\n patents plaintiff asserted and issued an exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders prohibiting the importation and sale of \nNJOY ACE\n.  The ITC sent its orders to the Office of the United States Trade Representative for review.  The Trade Representative has \n60\n days to review the ITC’s determination.  If the Trade Representative disapproves of the ITC’s determination, the orders will not go into effect.  If the Trade Representative does not affirmatively reject the ITC’s determination, the determination automatically becomes final and takes effect after the \n60\n days have elapsed (March 31, 2025) or earlier if the Trade Representative notifies the ITC of approval before the \n60\n days elapse.  The final exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but the final exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders prohibiting the importation and sale of \nNJOY ACE\n would likely not be stayed during the pendency of such an appeal.\nIn November and December 2023 and February 2024, Altria and our affiliates filed petitions with the U.S. Patent Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) challenging the validity of the patents underlying JUUL and VMR’s patent infringement claims.  In May, June and August 2024, the PTAB denied Altria’s request to institute review as to \nfour\n patents (including \nthree\n of the patents that form the basis of the ITC’s final determination) and, in June 2024, granted Altria’s request to institute review as to \none\n of the patents that forms the basis of the ITC’s final determination.  The PTAB will conduct proceedings and issue its validity decision as to the \none\n JUUL patent by June 2025, after which appeals may be filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nIn August 2023, NJOY filed a complaint against JUUL in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting claims of patent infringement based on the sale of certain JUUL e-vapor products, including the currently marketed \nJUUL\n device and \nJUULpods\n,\n \nin the United States.  The lawsuit is currently stayed.\nAlso in August 2023, NJOY filed a related action against JUUL with the ITC alleging patent infringement and seeking a ban on the importation and sale of the same JUUL products in the United States.  A hearing before the ALJ was held in June 2024.  In December 2024, the ALJ issued an initial determination concluding that, while the patents NJOY asserted against JUUL are valid, JUUL products do not infringe the patents.  The ALJ also determined that, with respect to the asserted patents, NJOY did not satisfy the “domestic industry” requirement, which requires the party asserting a patent to show significant and substantial domestic investments, such as investments related to engineering, research and development or licensing, designed to exploit the patent.  Subsequently, in December 2024, NJOY petitioned the ITC to review the ALJ’s initial determination.  The ITC must decide whether to grant or deny review of the ALJ’s initial determination in whole or in part by February 3, 2025, subject to the ITC’s right to grant itself an extension.  If granted, the ITC’s review of the ALJ’s initial determination will proceed in the same manner as discussed above with respect to VMR and JUUL’s action against NJOY.  The ITC must issue its final determination, including with respect to the form of remedy, if any, to be ordered, by April 7, 2025, subject to its right to grant itself an extension.\nIn November 2023, JUUL filed petitions with the PTAB challenging the validity of the patents underlying NJOY’s patent infringement claims.  In May 2024, the PTAB agreed to review JUUL’s challenge to both of the NJOY patents asserted against JUUL.  The PTAB will conduct proceedings and issue its validity decisions by May 2025, after which appeals may be filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nWe, JUUL and VMR previously engaged with a mediator to attempt to negotiate a resolution of the proceedings pending before the ITC, U.S. District Courts and the PTAB.  The parties also have engaged in negotiations without a mediator.  Based on the status of the negotiations and the proceedings before the ITC, U.S. District Courts and the PTAB, we have determined that a loss is not probable or reasonably estimable as of the date of this filing.\nIQOS \nLitigation\nIn April 2020, RAI Strategic Holdings, Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co., which are affiliates of R.J. Reynolds, filed a lawsuit against Altria, PM USA, ALCS, PMI and its affiliate, Philip Morris Products S.A., in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia asserting claims of patent infringement based on the sale of the \nIQOS\n System electronic device and \nMarlboro HeatSticks\n in the United States.  Plaintiffs seek various remedies, including preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, treble damages and attorneys’ fees.  Altria and PMI were previously dismissed from the lawsuit, and plaintiffs’ claims against the other defendants have been stayed.\nPM USA, ALCS and Philip Morris Products S.A. filed counterclaims against plaintiffs in the Eastern District of Virginia lawsuit alleging patent infringement by R.J. Reynolds’ e-vapor products.  In June 2022, PM USA and ALCS reached an agreement with R.J. Reynolds resulting in dismissal of their counterclaims.  In addition, ALCS filed a separate lawsuit against R.J. Reynolds in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina also alleging patent infringement by R.J. Reynolds’ e-vapor products.  In September 2022, a jury awarded ALCS $\n95\n million in damages for past infringement, plus supplemental damages and interest.  In January 2023, the court ordered R.J. Reynolds to pay ALCS a \n5.25\n% royalty on future sales of its infringing product resulting in positive net income through the expiration of the relevant patents in 2035.  R.J. Reynolds filed a notice of appeal of the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the judgment in December 2024.  In July 2024, R.J. Reynolds moved the district court to vacate the judgment, including the damages awards and ongoing royalties, on the grounds that R.J. Reynolds obtained a \n99\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nsub-license to the asserted patents from JUUL in December 2023.  In December 2024, the district court denied the motion as to the damages award and royalties due through December 2023.  The district court also found that additional proceedings were warranted on the part of the motion regarding royalties after R.J. Reynolds obtained an evidentiary hearing.  As gains related to this lawsuit have not yet been determined to be realized or realizable in accordance with GAAP, they have not been recognized in our financial statements.\nIn November 2020, Healthier Choices Management Corp. filed an additional unrelated patent infringement case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against PM USA and Philip Morris Products S.A. seeking damages and equitable relief.  In February 2021, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which the court granted in July 2021.  In December 2021, the U.S. District Court denied plaintiff’s motion to amend the complaint and plaintiff appealed this ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reversed the district court’s decision and remanded for further proceedings.  On remand, the U.S. District Court stayed the case pending the outcome of plaintiff’s appeal from a ruling by the PTAB, which issued a decision that the claims of the asserted patent are invalid.  In November 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB’s decision that the asserted patent is invalid.  In December 2024, Healthier Choices Management Corp. voluntarily dismissed its case.\nAntitrust Litigation\nIn March 2023, we entered into the Stock Transfer Agreement with JUUL pursuant to which, among other things, we transferred to JUUL all of our beneficially owned JUUL equity securities.  See Note 8.\n Investments in Equity Securities\n for a discussion of our disposition of our investment in JUUL.\nAs of January 27, 2025, \n17\n putative class action lawsuits have been filed against Altria and JUUL in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  In November 2020, these lawsuits were consolidated into \nthree\n complaints (one on behalf of direct purchasers, one on behalf of indirect purchasers and one on behalf of indirect resellers).  The consolidated lawsuits, as amended, allege that Altria and JUUL violated Sections 1, 2 and/or 3 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act and various state antitrust, consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws by restraining trade and/or substantially lessening competition in the U.S. closed-system electronic cigarette market.  Plaintiffs seek various remedies, including treble damages, attorneys’ fees, a declaration that the agreements between Altria and JUUL are invalid and rescission of the transaction.  In February 2024, the court ordered that certain of the direct-purchaser plaintiffs’ claims against JUUL be sent to arbitration pursuant to an arbitration provision in JUUL’s online purchase agreement and dismissed without prejudice the direct-purchaser plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief.  The trial with respect to the consolidated lawsuits is set to commence in May 2026.\nFederal and State Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits\nIn October 2022, we agreed to settle a series of federal and state derivative cases brought by Altria shareholders on behalf of themselves and Altria against Altria and certain of our current and former executives and directors and JUUL, its founders and certain of its current and former executives.  The cases related to our former investment in JUUL and asserted claims of breach of fiduciary duty by the Altria defendants and aiding and abetting in that alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the remaining defendants.\nUnder the terms of the settlement, which became effective in May 2023, among other things, we agreed to provide $\n100\n million in funding over a \nfive-year\n period to underage tobacco prevention and cessation programs, which may include positive youth development programs, led by independent third-party organizations.  We began providing funding in the third quarter of 2024.  In 2022, we recorded pre-tax provisions totaling $\n27\n million for costs associated with the independent monitoring of our funding commitments and attorneys’ fees.  In the first quarter of 2023, we recorded pre-tax provisions totaling approximately $\n100\n million related to the settlement, and in April 2023, paid $\n15\n million to plaintiffs’ escrow account for attorneys’ fees.\nCertain Other Tobacco-Related Litigation\n“Lights/Ultra Lights” Cases and Other Smoking and Health Class Actions\n:\n \nPlaintiffs have sought certification of their cases as class actions, alleging among other things, that the uses of the terms “Lights” and/or “Ultra Lights” constitute deceptive and unfair trade practices, common law or statutory fraud, unjust enrichment or breach of warranty, and have sought injunctive and equitable relief, including restitution and, in certain cases, punitive damages.  These class actions have been brought against PM USA and, in certain instances, Altria or our other subsidiaries, on behalf of individuals who purchased and consumed various brands of cigarettes.  Defenses raised in these cases include lack of misrepresentation, lack of causation, injury and damages, the statute of limitations, non-liability under state statutory provisions exempting conduct that complies with federal regulatory directives, and the First Amendment.  \nTwenty-one\n state courts in \n23\n “Lights” cases have refused to certify class actions, dismissed class action allegations, reversed prior class certification decisions or have entered judgment in favor of PM USA.  As of January 27, 2025, \ntwo\n “Lights/Ultra Lights” class actions are pending in U.S. state courts.  Neither case is active.\nAs of January 27, 2025, \none\n smoking and health case alleging personal injury or seeking court-supervised programs or an ongoing medical monitoring program on behalf of individuals exposed to ETS and purporting to be brought on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs, is pending in a U.S. state court.  The case is currently inactive.\nUST Litigation\n: \nUST and/or its tobacco subsidiaries have been named in a number of individual tobacco and health lawsuits over time.  Plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases have been based on various theories of recovery, such as negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, breach of implied warranty, addiction and breach of consumer protection statutes.  \n100\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nPlaintiffs have typically sought various forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, and certain equitable relief, including disgorgement.  Defenses raised in these cases have included lack of causation, assumption of the risk, comparative fault and/or contributory negligence, and statutes of limitations.  As of January 27, 2025, there is \nno\n such case pending against UST and/or its tobacco subsidiaries.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nAltria and our former subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as “Superfund”), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party.  Altria and our former subsidiaries are involved in several cost recovery/contribution cases subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under Superfund or other laws and regulations.  We expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations.\nWe provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.  Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future.  In the opinion of our management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation.  At December 31, 2024, we (i) had $\n43\n million of unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and (ii) were contingently liable for guarantees related to our own performance, including $\n19\n million for surety bonds.  In addition, from time to time, we issue lines of credit to affiliated entities.  These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on our liquidity.\nUnder the terms of a distribution agreement between Altria and PMI (“Distribution Agreement”), entered into as a result of our 2008 spin-off of our former subsidiary PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer.  PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.  We do not have a related liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant.  PMI has agreed not to seek indemnification with respect to the active \nIQOS\n System patent litigation discussed above under \nIQOS Litigation\n.\nAs part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement.  For further discussion of the supplier financing program, see Note 5. \nSupplier Financing\n.\nPM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our $\n3.0\n billion Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.\n101\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Altria Group, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below\n \nare matters\n \narising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\n \nconsolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, \n102\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nE-Vapor Product Litigation \nAs described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions against the Company as well as its respective indemnitees.  Management records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  The Company's accrued liability for tobacco and health and certain other litigation items is $96 million as of December 31, 2024.  In establishing this liability, management evaluates tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, including e-vapor product litigation.  While it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except for those cases which, as described in Note 20, have been accrued for, (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to e-vapor product litigation is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining if a loss for e-vapor product litigation should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s determination of whether a loss should be recorded.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s loss determination for tobacco and health litigation matters, including e-vapor product litigation, and controls over the related financial statement disclosures.  These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the completeness of the Company’s description of e-vapor product litigation matters; (ii) confirming with external and internal legal counsel the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the extent to which a loss is estimable for e-vapor product litigation matters; (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s determination regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome for e-vapor product litigation matters; and (iv) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s e-vapor product litigation disclosures.\nSkoal Trademark Impairment Assessments\nAs described in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s \nSkoal\n trademark had a carrying value of $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2024.  Management conducts an annual review of indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require management to perform an interim review.  In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the interim period ended June 30, 2024, management evaluated the accelerated growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related increase in competitive activity among tobacco categories, which have contributed to reductions in sales volumes for Moist Smokeless Tobacco products, including \nSkoal\n.  Management concluded that the expected impact from the sales volume declines on the \nSkoal \ntrademark represented a triggering event and performed an interim impairment assessment as of June 30, 2024.  Management determined the estimated fair value of the \nSkoal\n trademark as of June 30, 2024 was below its carrying value and recorded an impairment of $354 million during the second quarter of 2024.  Management’s annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2024 resulted in no impairment charge.  Management used an income approach to estimate the fair value of the \nSkoal \ntrademark.  The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows.  In performing the 2024 valuation, management’s cash flow analysis for the \nSkoal\n trademark included significant judgments and assumptions related to volume, revenue, income, operating margins, perpetual growth rate and discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the \nSkoal\n trademark impairment assessments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the \nSkoal\n trademark; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue, perpetual growth rates, and the discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s \nSkoal\n trademark.  These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates of the \nSkoal\n trademark; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the income approach; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue, perpetual growth rates, and the discount rates.  Evaluating management’s assumption related to revenue involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the\n Skoal\n brand; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence \n103\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nobtained in other areas of the audit.  Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company’s income approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the perpetual growth rate and discount rate assumptions.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment- E-Vapor Reporting Unit\nAs described in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance was $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, and the goodwill associated with the e-vapor reporting unit was $1.8 billion.  Management conducts an annual review of goodwill for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require management to perform an interim review.  Management used an income approach to estimate the fair values of the Company’s reporting units.  The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired.  In performing the 2024 valuation, management’s cash flow analysis for the e-vapor reporting unit included significant judgments and assumptions related to\n \nvolume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rate and discount rate.  During 2024, management’s annual impairment test of goodwill resulted in no impairment charges.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the e-vapor reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to\n \nvolume, perpetual growth rate, and discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the e-vapor reporting unit.  These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the income approach; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the volume, perpetual growth rate and discount rate.  Evaluating management’s assumption related to volume involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the Company’s e-vapor reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.  Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company’s income approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the perpetual growth rate and discount rate assumptions.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nRichmond, Virginia\nJanuary 30, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1934, which is when the Company became subject to SEC reporting requirements.

Altria Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:\nn\n  \npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Altria Group, Inc.;\nn\n  \nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;\nn\n  \nprovide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Altria Group, Inc. are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of Altria Group, Inc.; and\nn\n  \nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
