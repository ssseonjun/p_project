    "item1": "Item 1—Business—Reinsurance.”  The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures.  The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company’s catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge.  The amounts for earthquakes reflect U.S. and Canadian property and workers’ compensation exposures.  These loss amounts include the effects of exposure growth, inflation and modeling updates based on recent trends and scientific analysis.  The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated loss amounts.  \nCatastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history.  These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output.  Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable.  Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect.  Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.  In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases.  In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable.\n \nActual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount.  In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period. \nMoreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers’ compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar flares and other naturally-occurring events, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber events.  \nIn addition, compared to models for hurricanes, models for earthquakes are less reliable due to there being a more limited number of significant historical events to analyze, while models for tornadoes, hail storms, wildfires and winter storms are newer and may be less reliable due to the highly random geographic nature and size of these events. Accordingly, these models may be less accurate in predicting risks and estimating losses. Further, changes in climate conditions could cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively evaluate and manage catastrophe risk.\n \nAs compared to natural catastrophes, modeling for man-made catastrophes, such as terrorism and cyber events, is even more difficult and less reliable, and for some events (both natural and man-made), models are either in early stages of development and, therefore, not widely adopted, or are not available.\n87\nFor more information about the Company’s exposure to catastrophe losses, see “",

Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The following is a discussion of the Company’s primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of December 31, 2024. The Company’s market risk sensitive instruments, including derivatives, are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading.\nThe carrying value of the Company’s investment portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $94.22 billion and $88.81 billion, respectively, of which 89% and 87%, respectively, was invested in fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 6.8% and 7.2%, respectively, of the Company’s invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies.  The Company’s exposure to equity price risk is not significant. The Company has no direct commodity risk and is not a party to any credit default swaps.\nThe primary market risks to the investment portfolio are interest rate risk and credit risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. The portfolio duration is primarily managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions.  For additional information regarding the Company’s investments, see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements as well as the “Investment Portfolio” and “Outlook” sections of “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” \nThe primary market risk for all of the Company’s debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing. The Company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach. For additional information regarding the Company’s debt, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements as well as the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” \nThe Company’s foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the Company’s invested assets, insurance reserves and shareholders’ equity denominated in foreign currencies. Cash flows from the Company’s foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies. The Company purchases these investments primarily to fund insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency, effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure.  Invested assets denominated in the Canadian dollar comprised approximately 3.8% and 4.1% of the total invested assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Invested assets denominated in the British Pound Sterling comprised approximately 2.4% of total invested assets at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. Invested assets denominated in other currencies at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not material.\nThere were no other significant changes in the Company’s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.\n117\nSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nSensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings, fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period of time. In the Company’s sensitivity analysis model, a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. “Near-term” means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure, especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the Company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value. \nInterest Rate Risk\nIn this sensitivity analysis model, the Company uses fair values to measure its potential loss. The sensitivity analysis model includes the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading: fixed maturities, non-redeemable preferred stocks, mortgage loans, short-term securities and debt and derivative financial instruments. The primary market risk to the Company’s market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk (inclusive of credit spreads). The sensitivity analysis model uses various basis point changes in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model.\nFor invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk, estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result from a parallel increase in interest rates. Durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put and interest rate reset features. Durations on tax-exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the U.S. Treasury curve. Fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value-weighted basis, including accrued interest, using holdings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFor debt, the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical December 31, 2024 and 2023 ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a 100 basis point change, comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices, and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding.\nThe sensitivity analysis model used by the Company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately $3.06 billion and $2.58 billion based on a 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the Company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from emerging interest rate trends. In addition, the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments. A hypothetical 10% reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings. The Company’s analysis indicates that a hypothetical 10% reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $643 million and $638 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n118\nITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULES\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n (\nKPMG LLP\n, \nNew York, NY\n, Auditor Firm ID: \n185\n)\n120\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nStatement of Income for the years ended December 31, 202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 20\n2\n2\n122\nStatement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 202\n2\n123\nBalance Sheet a\ns of\n December 31, 202\n4\n and 202\n3\n124\nStatement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 202\n2\n125\nStatement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 202\n2\n126\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n127\nSchedules:\nSchedule II - Condensed Financial Information of Registrant (Parent Company Only)\n216\nSchedule III - Supplementary Insurance Information\n221\nSchedule V - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\n222\nSchedule VI - Supplementary Information Concerning Property-Casualty Insurance Operations \n223\n119\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nThe Travelers Companies, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated\n \nFinancial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of The Travelers Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules as listed in the accompanying index to consolidated financial statements and schedules\n \n(collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the estimate of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves \nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent the Company’s estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date. The Company derives estimates of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves principally utilizing actuarial expertise and various projection methods. The Company’s claims and claim adjustment expense reserves balance at December 31, 2024 was $64.1 billion.   \nWe identified the evaluation of the estimate of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves as a critical audit matter. The process of evaluating the estimate of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves significant auditor judgment due to the inherent uncertainty in the ultimate amounts and timing of claim payments, which may be affected by a number of internal and external considerations. \n120\nEvaluating the impact of these considerations on the ultimate costs of claims and claim adjustment expenses requires specialized skills and knowledge. \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We, with involvement of actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s reserving process for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. This included controls related to the actuarial analyses and the determination of the Company’s estimate of the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. We also involved actuarial professionals, who assisted in: \n•\nassessing the methodologies underlying the Company’s claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimate and comparing to generally accepted actuarial practices\n•\nevaluating for certain lines of business, the Company’s estimates by performing independent analyses of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves using Company historical loss experience and industry data\n•\nassessing, for selected other lines of business, the Company’s internally prepared actuarial projection methods and key assumptions in comparison to the Company’s internal experience and related industry trends\n•\ndeveloping a range of reserve estimates and assessing the position and movement within the range of the Company’s recorded reserves in order to evaluate the Company’s consolidated reserves. \n/s/ KPMG LLP\nKPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1994.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 13, 2025 \n121\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\n                                     \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company).  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  To the extent that the Company changes its accounting for or presentation of items in the financial statements, the presentation of such amounts in prior periods is changed to conform to the current period presentation, if appropriate, and a disclosure is provided, if material.\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Corvus Insurance Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Corvus), a cyber insurance managing general underwriter, for consideration transferred of approximately $\n427\n million. The acquisition provides the Company the opportunity to renew Corvus’s book of business and to leverage Corvus’s capabilities to enhance the return profile of Travelers’ existing cyber portfolio. At the acquisition date, the Company recorded at fair value $\n478\n million of assets acquired and $\n51\n million of liabilities assumed as part of purchase accounting, including $\n390\n million of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. The assets acquired from Corvus were included in the Company’s Bond & Specialty Insurance segment, effective at the acquisition date. The Company funded this transaction from internal resources. A provisional amount of $\n19\n million was recorded as a deferred tax asset and included on the consolidated balance sheet on January 2, 2024, and was later increased by an insignificant amount when the 2023 tax return for Corvus was finalized.\nAccounting Policies\nInvestments\nFixed Maturities\nFixed maturities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks. Fixed maturities, including instruments subject to securities lending agreements, are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. \nEquity Securities\nEquity securities, which include public and non-public common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net realized investment gains (losses).  \nReal Estate Investments\nThe Company’s real estate investments include warehouses, office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly owned. Real estate is recorded on the purchase date at the purchase price, which generally represents fair value, and is supported by internal analysis or external appraisals that use discounted cash flow analyses and other acceptable valuation techniques.  Real estate held for investment purposes is subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nBuildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the expected useful life of the building or \n39\n years.  Real estate held for sale is carried at lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\nShort-term Securities\nShort-term securities have an original maturity of less than \none year\n and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.\n127\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n1.\n                                     \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nOther Investments\nInvestments in Private Equity Limited Partnerships, Hedge Funds and Real Estate Partnerships\nThe Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships.  The partnerships and the hedge funds generally report investments on their balance sheet at fair value.  The financial statements prepared by the investee are received by the Company on a lag basis, with the lag period generally dependent upon the type of underlying investments. The private equity and real estate partnerships provide financial information quarterly which is generally available to investors, including the Company, within \nthree months\n following the date of the reporting period.  The hedge funds provide financial information monthly, which is generally available to investors within \none month\n following the date of the reporting period.  The Company regularly requests financial information from the partnerships prior to the receipt of the partnerships’ financial statements and records any material information obtained from these requests in its consolidated financial statements.\nOther\nDerivatives are also included in other investments.  The Company’s derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value, with the changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statement of income in net realized investment gains (losses).  For a further discussion of the derivatives used by the Company, see note 3.\nNet Investment Income\nInvestment income from fixed maturities is recognized based on the constant effective yield method which includes an adjustment for estimated principal pre-payments, if any. The effective yield used to determine amortization for fixed maturities subject to prepayment risk (e.g., asset-backed, loan-backed and structured securities) is recalculated and adjusted periodically based upon actual historical and/or projected future cash flows, which are obtained from a widely-accepted securities data provider.  The adjustments to the yield for highly rated prepayable fixed maturities are accounted for using the retrospective method.  The adjustments to the yield for non-highly rated prepayable fixed maturities are accounted for using the prospective method.  Dividends on equity securities (including those with transfer restrictions) are recognized in income when declared.  Rental income on real estate is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  See the section titled: Real Estate in note 3 for further discussion.  Investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Company’s share of the investee’s earnings or losses in the fund is reported in net investment income.\nAccrual of income is suspended on non-securitized fixed maturities that are in default, or on which it is likely that future payments will not be made as scheduled.  Interest income on investments in default is recognized only when payments are received.  Investments included in the consolidated balance sheet that were not income-producing for the preceding 12 months were not material.\nNet Realized Investment Gains and Losses\nNet realized investment gains and losses include net realized gains (losses) from the sale of investments, credit impairment losses on investment assets, impairments of real estate investments, changes in the fair value of equity securities, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments. Net realized investment gains (losses) on the sale of investments are included as a component of pre-tax revenues based upon specific identification of the investments sold on the trade date.\n \n128\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n1.\n                                     \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nInvestment Impairments \nThe Company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets that may have credit impairments.\nCredit Impairments Related to Fixed Maturity Investments\nSome of the factors considered in assessing impairment of fixed maturity investments due to credit-related factors include: (1) the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost; (2) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; (3) the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest; and (4) whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value.\nFor fixed maturity investments that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains (losses).  The impairment related to all other factors (non-credit factors) is reported in other comprehensive income. The allowance is adjusted for any additional credit losses and subsequent recoveries. Upon recognizing a credit loss, the cost basis is not adjusted. \nFor fixed maturity investments where the Company records a credit loss, a determination is made as to the cause of the impairment and whether the Company expects a recovery in the value.  For fixed maturity investments where the Company expects a recovery in value, the constant effective yield method is utilized, and the investment is amortized to par.\nFor fixed maturity investments the Company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses). The new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized in net realized investment gains (losses).  The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nThe Company reports investment income accrued separately from fixed maturity investments, available for sale, and has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for investment income accrued. Investment income accrued is written off through net realized investment gains (losses) at the time the issuer of the bond defaults or is expected to default on payments.\nUncollectible available-for-sale debt securities are written-off when the Company determines that no additional payments of principal or interest will be received.\nDetermination of Credit Loss — Fixed Maturities\nThe Company determines the credit loss component of fixed maturity investments by utilizing discounted cash flow modeling to determine the present value of the security and comparing the present value with the amortized cost of the security.  If the amortized cost is greater than the present value of the expected cash flows, the difference is considered a credit loss and recognized as an impairment loss in net realized investment gains (losses).\nFor non-structured fixed maturities (U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities, obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, debt securities issued by foreign governments and certain corporate debt), the estimate of expected cash flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery time frame and assessing whether further principal and interest will be received.  The determination of recovery value incorporates an issuer valuation assumption utilizing one or a combination of valuation methods as deemed appropriate by the Company.  The Company determines the undiscounted recovery value by allocating the estimated value of the issuer to the Company’s assessment of the priority of claims.  The present value of the cash flows is determined by applying the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment) and an estimated recovery time frame.  Generally, that time frame for securities for which the issuer is in bankruptcy is \n12\n months.  For securities for which the issuer is financially troubled but not in bankruptcy, that time frame is generally \n24\n months.  Included in the present value calculation are expected principal and interest payments; however, for securities for which the issuer is classified as bankrupt or in default, the present value calculation assumes no interest payments and a single recovery amount.\n129\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n1.\n                                     \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nIn estimating the recovery value, significant judgment is involved in the development of assumptions relating to a myriad of factors related to the issuer including, but not limited to, revenue, margin and earnings projections, the likely market or liquidation values of assets, potential additional debt to be incurred pre- or post-bankruptcy/restructuring, the ability to shift existing or new debt to different priority layers, the amount of restructuring/bankruptcy expenses, the size and priority of unfunded pension obligations, litigation or other contingent claims, the treatment of intercompany claims and the likely outcome with respect to inter-creditor conflicts.\nFor structured fixed maturity securities (primarily residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities), the Company estimates the present value of the security by projecting future cash flows of the assets underlying the securitization, allocating the flows to the various tranches based on the structure of the securitization and determining the present value of the cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment or changes in expected cash flows).  The Company incorporates levels of delinquencies, defaults and severities as well as credit attributes of the remaining assets in the securitization, along with other economic data, to arrive at its estimate of the parameters applied to the assets underlying the securitization.  \nReal Estate Investments\nOn at least an annual basis, the Company obtains independent appraisals for substantially all of its real estate investments. In addition, the carrying value of all real estate investments is reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The review for impairment considers the valuation from the independent appraisal, when applicable, and incorporates an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the real estate property. An impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the real estate property.  The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value.\nOther Investments\nThe Company reviews its investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships for impairment no less frequently than quarterly and monitors the performance throughout the year through discussions with the managers/general partners.  If the Company becomes aware of an impairment of a partnership’s investments at the balance sheet date prior to receiving the partnership’s financial statements, it will recognize an impairment by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the partnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income.\nChanges in Intent to Sell Temporarily Impaired Assets\nThe Company may, from time to time, sell invested assets subsequent to the balance sheet date that it did not intend to sell at the balance sheet date.  Conversely, the Company may not sell invested assets that it asserted that it intended to sell at the balance sheet date.  Such changes in intent are due to events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date.  The types of events that may result in a change in intent include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances related to the invested asset (e.g., a downgrade or upgrade from a rating agency), significant unforeseen changes in liquidity needs, or changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment.\nSecurities Lending\nThe Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. Borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least \n102\n% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. This collateral is held by a third-party custodian, and the Company has the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution borrowing the Company’s securities is in default under the lending agreement (i.e., the Company is not permitted to re-pledge or sell any such collateral). Therefore, the Company does not recognize the receipt of the collateral held by the third-party custodian or the obligation to return the collateral. The loaned securities remain a recorded asset of the Company.  The Company accepts only cash as collateral for securities on loan and restricts the manner in which that cash is invested.\n130\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n1.\n                                     \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash represents funds that are legally or contractually restricted as to withdrawal or usage.  These restrictions primarily relate to certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company providing brokerage and other insurance-related services.\nReinsurance Recoverables\nAmounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. Included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to certain structured settlements. The Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for amounts that are estimated to be uncollectible. The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors.  For structured settlements, the allowance is also based upon the Company’s ongoing review of life insurers’ creditworthiness and estimated amounts of coverage that would be available from state guaranty funds if a life insurer defaults.  A probability-of-default methodology which reflects current and forecasted economic conditions is used to estimate the amount of uncollectible reinsurance due to credit-related factors and the estimate is reported in an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance also includes estimated uncollectible amounts related to dispute risk with reinsurers.  Amounts deemed to be uncollectible, including amounts due from known insolvent reinsurers, are written off against the allowance.  Changes in the allowance, as well as any subsequent collections of amounts previously written off, are reported as part of claims and claim adjustment expenses.  The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nIncremental direct costs of acquired, new and renewal insurance contracts, consisting of commissions (other than contingent commissions) and premium-related taxes, are capitalized and charged to expense pro rata over the contract periods in which the related premiums are earned.  Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income and, if not, are charged to expense. Future investment income attributable to related premiums is taken into account in measuring the recoverability of the carrying value of this asset. All other acquisition expenses are charged to operations as incurred.\nContractholder Receivables and Payables\nUnder certain workers’ compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant for the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. These amounts are included on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet in both contractholder payables and contractholder receivables.  Contractholder receivables are reported net of an allowance for expected credit losses.  The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, changes in policyholder credit standing, and other relevant factors.  A probability-of-default methodology, which reflects current and forecasted economic conditions, is used to estimate the allowance for expected credit losses.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company performs a review, on at least an annual basis, of goodwill held by the reporting units which are the Company’s \nthree\n operating and reportable segments: Business Insurance; Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Personal Insurance.  The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to their carrying value, including goodwill.  If the carrying values of the reporting units were to exceed their fair value, the amount of the impairment would be calculated and goodwill adjusted accordingly.\nThe Company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units.  The discounted cash flow model is an income approach to valuation that is based on a detailed cash flow analysis for deriving a current fair value of reporting units and is representative of the Company’s reporting units’ current and expected future financial performance.  The discount rate assumptions reflect the Company’s assessment of the risks inherent in the projected future cash flows and the Company’s weighted-average cost of capital, and are compared against available market data for reasonableness.\n131\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n1.\n                                     \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets held by the Company are also reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis.  The classification of the asset as indefinite-lived is reassessed and an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives.  The carrying amount of intangible assets with a finite useful life is regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment in value.  Impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.\nAs a result of the reviews performed for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the respective carrying value of its reporting units for those years and that goodwill was not impaired.  The Company also determined during its reviews for each year that its other indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.\nInternal-Use Software\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company develops and purchases software as well as enters into arrangements to utilize software as a service under cloud computing arrangements.   These software costs and any costs related to the implementation and set-up of the cloud computing arrangements are capitalized and reported within other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.\n \nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\nClaims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management’s estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) as of the balance sheet date. The reserves are adjusted regularly based upon experience. Included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in the consolidated balance sheet are reserves for long-term disability and annuity claim payments, primarily arising from workers’ compensation insurance and workers’ compensation excess insurance policies, that are discounted to the present value of estimated future payments.\nThe Company performs a continuing review of its claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, including its reserving techniques and the impact of reinsurance. The reserves are also reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company.  Since the reserves are based on estimates, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such reserves. The effects of changes in such estimated reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. Such changes in estimates could occur in a future period and may be material to the Company’s results of operations and financial position in such period.\nOther Liabilities\nIncluded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet is the Company’s estimate of its liability for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. The liability for expected state guaranty fund and other premium-based assessments is recognized as the Company writes or becomes obligated to write or renew the premiums on which the assessments are expected to be based.  The liability for loss-based assessments is recognized as the related losses are incurred. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a liability of $\n182\n million and $\n183\n million, respectively, for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments and related recoverables of $\n29\n million and $\n26\n million, respectively.   The liability for such assessments and the related recoverables are not discounted for the time value of money. The loss-based assessments are expected to be paid over a period ranging from \none year\n to the life expectancy of certain workers’ compensation claimants and the recoveries are expected to occur over the same period of time.\nAlso included in other liabilities is an accrual for policyholder dividends. Certain insurance contracts, primarily workers’ compensation, are participating whereby dividends are paid to policyholders in accordance with contract provisions. Net written premiums for participating dividend policies were approximately \n1\n% of total net written premiums for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  Policyholder dividends are accrued against earnings using best available estimates of amounts to be paid.  The liability accrued for policyholder dividends totaled $\n81\n million and $\n77\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n132\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n1.\n                                     \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nTreasury Stock\nThe cost of common stock repurchased by the Company is reported as treasury stock and represents authorized and unissued shares of the Company under the Minnesota Business Corporation Act.\nStatutory Accounting Practices\nThe Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the State of Connecticut, are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance departments of the states of domicile. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are those practices that are incorporated directly or by reference in state laws, regulations, and general administrative rules applicable to all insurance enterprises domiciled in a particular state. The State of Connecticut requires insurers domiciled in Connecticut to prepare their statutory financial statements in accordance with National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) statutory accounting practices.\nPermitted statutory accounting practices are those practices that differ either from state-prescribed statutory accounting practices or NAIC statutory accounting practices.\nThe Company does not apply any statutory accounting practices that would be considered a prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practice that differs from NAIC statutory accounting practices.\nThe Company’s non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with the regulatory reporting requirements of their respective local jurisdiction.\nPremiums and Unearned Premium Reserves\nPremiums are recognized as revenues over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided, which is generally pro rata over the policy period. Unearned premium reserves represent the unexpired portion of policy premiums. Accrued retrospective premiums are included in premium balances receivable.  Premium balances receivable are reported net of an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, historical loss data, including delinquencies and write-offs, current and forecasted economic conditions and other relevant factors.  Credit risk is partially mitigated by the Company’s ability to cancel the policy if the policyholder does not pay the premium.\nThe cost of reinsurance premiums (ceded reinsurance premiums) is generally reflected in income (as a charge to income) in a manner consistent with the recognition of premium on the underlying reinsurance contracts.  For catastrophe coverage, the cost of reinsurance premiums is generally recognized ratably over the contract period to the extent coverage remains available. Ceded unearned premiums represent the unexpired portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as an asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\nFee Income\nFee income includes revenues from risk and claims management services provided to the Company’s insureds and third-party non-insureds, as well as policy issuance and claims management services to workers’ compensation residual market pools.  Fee income is earned over the policy period for the services provided to the Company’s insureds, and either over the contract period or as the Company completes its service obligations for the services provided to third-party non-insureds.\n \nOther Revenues\nOther revenues include revenues from premium installment charges, which are recognized as collected, gains and losses on dispositions of assets and redemption of debt, and other miscellaneous revenues, including gains recognized as a result of settlements of reinsurance disputes and claim-related legal matters.\nOther revenues also include revenues from noninsurance subsidiaries (other than fee income) for insurance-related services and on-line insurance brokerage services and is recognized as the service is provided to the customer.\n \n133\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n1.\n                                     \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company assigns functional currencies to its foreign operations, which are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the functional currency, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reported in net realized investment gains (losses). Functional currency amounts are then translated into U.S. dollars. The foreign currency remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for items reported in the balance sheet and average exchange rates for items recorded in earnings.  The change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year, net of tax, is a component of other comprehensive income.\nForeign currency gains and losses related to the changes in fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturities are reported in other comprehensive income. All other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reported in earnings.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company has an employee stock incentive compensation plan that permits grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock, stock units, performance awards and other share-based or share-denominated awards with respect to the Company’s common stock.\nCompensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of an award\n,\n utilizing the assumptions discussed in note 14.  Compensation cost is recognized for financial reporting purposes over the period in which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period).  In connection with certain share-based awards, participants are entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, either in cash or dividend equivalent shares, commensurate with the dividends paid to common shareholders.  Dividends and dividend equivalent shares on awards that are expected to vest are recorded in retained earnings.  Dividends paid on awards that are not expected to vest as part of the Company’s forfeiture estimate are recorded as compensation expense.\nNature of Operations\nBusiness Insurance\nBusiness Insurance offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance products and services to its customers, primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world, including as a corporate member of Lloyd’s.  Business Insurance is organized as follows:\nDomestic\n•\nSelect Accounts \nprovides small businesses with property and casualty insurance products and services, including commercial multi-peril, workers’ compensation, commercial automobile, general liability and commercial property.\n•\nMiddle Market\n provides mid-sized businesses with property and casualty insurance products and services, including workers’ compensation, general liability, commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and commercial property, as well as risk management, claims handling and other services.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n1.\n                                     \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nAutomobile policies provide coverage for liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage, uninsured motorist protection, and for physical damage to an insured’s own vehicle from collision, fire, flood, hail and theft.  In addition, many states require policies to provide first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.\nHomeowners and Other policies provide protection against losses to dwellings and contents from a variety of perils (excluding flooding) as well as coverage for personal liability. The Company writes homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and tenants, and rental properties.  The Company also writes coverage for boats and yachts, valuable personal items such as jewelry, umbrella liability, and weddings and special events.\n2.\n                                     \n \nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe accounting policies used to prepare the segment reporting data for the Company’s \nthree\n reportable business segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in note 1.\nThe chief operating decision maker (CODM) is the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM reviews the financial performance of the reportable business segments to assess the efficiency with which capital is employed, the effective management of risk, the achievement of strategic initiatives, and how to allocate resources to reportable business segments based on the segment’s historical and projected financial performance. The significant measures of the reportable business segments’ financial performance include segment revenues, consisting of premiums, net investment income, fee income and other revenues, less segment expenses, consisting of claims and claim adjustment expenses, deferred acquisition costs, and general and administrative expenses.\nExcept as described below for certain legal entities, the Company allocates its invested assets and the related net investment income to its reportable business segments.  Pre-tax net investment income is allocated based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment. For investable funds, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the estimated duration of the loss reserves’ future cash flows, the interest rate environment at the time the losses were incurred and A+ rated corporate debt instrument yields.  For capital, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the average yield on the total investment portfolio.  The benchmark investment yields are applied to each segment’s investable funds and capital, respectively, to produce a total notional investment income by segment.  The Company’s actual net investment income is allocated to each segment in proportion to the respective segment’s notional investment income to total notional investment income.  There are certain legal entities within the Company that are dedicated to specific reportable business segments.  The invested assets and related net investment income from these legal entities are reported in the applicable business segment and are not allocated among the other business segments.\nThe cost of the Company’s catastrophe treaty program is included in the Company’s ceded premiums and is allocated among reportable business segments based on an estimate of actual market reinsurance pricing using expected losses calculated by the Company’s catastrophe model, adjusted for any experience adjustments.\nThe following tables summarize the components of the Company’s revenues, income (loss), net written premiums and total assets by reportable business segments.\n136\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

Negotiated terms and conditions include, among others, rental rates, length of lease period and improvements to the premises to be provided by the Company.\nProceeds from the sales of real estate investments were $\n64\n million in 2024, $\n0 million\n in 2023 and $\n10\n million in 2022.  Gains of $\n17\n million and $\n4\n million were realized on those sales in 2024 and 2022, respectively.  Net realized investment losses in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included $\n5\n million, $\n9\n million and $\n12\n million, respectively, of impairment charges related to real estate.  Accumulated depreciation on real estate held for investment purposes was $\n581\n million and $\n556\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFuture minimum rental income on operating leases relating to the Company’s real estate properties is expected to be $\n118\n million, $\n107\n million, $\n93\n million, $\n72\n million and $\n46\n million for 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029, respectively, and $\n87\n million for 2030 and thereafter.\nShort-term Securities\nThe Company’s short-term securities consist of Aaa-rated registered money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, high-quality commercial paper (primarily A1/P1) and high-quality corporate securities purchased within a year to their maturity with a combined average of \n23\n days to maturity at December 31, 2024.  The amortized cost of these securities, which totaled $\n4.77\n billion and $\n5.14\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, approximated their fair value.\nOther Investments\nIncluded in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company \none month\n to \nthree months\n following the end of the reporting period.  Accordingly, net investment income from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company’s financial statements on a quarter lag basis.  \n144\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n3.\n                                     \n \nINVESTMENTS (Continued)\nVariable Interest Entities\nEntities which do not have sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support or in which the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of a controlling financial interest are referred to as variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated by the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest (primary beneficiary) as a result of having both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of an entity subject to consolidation based on a qualitative assessment of the VIE’s capital structure, contractual terms, nature of the VIE’s operations and purpose and the Company’s relative exposure to the related risks of the VIE on the date it becomes initially involved in the VIE. The Company reassesses its VIE determination with respect to an entity on an ongoing basis.\nThe Company is a passive investor in limited partner equity interests issued by third party VIEs. These include certain of the Company’s investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships where the Company is not related to the general partner. These investments are generally accounted for under the equity method and reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as other investments unless the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary. These equity interests generally cannot be redeemed. Distributions from these investments are received by the Company as a result of liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds and/or as income distribution. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and any unfunded commitment. The Company considers an investment in a VIE in which it has a \n20\n% or greater equity interest as a significant VIE.  Neither the Company’s carrying amounts nor the unfunded commitments related to these significant VIE’s are material individually or in the aggregate. \nUnrealized Investment Losses\nThe following tables summarize, for all fixed maturities classified as available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by the length of time those securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position.  The fair value amounts reported in the tables are estimates that are prepared using the process described in note 4.  The Company also relies upon estimates of several factors in its review and evaluation of individual investments, using the process described in note 1, in determining whether a credit loss impairment exists.\nLess than 12 months\n12 months or longer\nTotal\n(at December 31, 2024, in millions)\nFair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFixed maturities\nU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities\n$\n557\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2,830\n \n$\n168\n \n$\n3,387\n \n$\n169\n \nObligations of U.S. states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n8,584\n \n160\n \n15,007\n \n2,224\n \n23,591\n \n2,384\n \nDebt securities issued by foreign governments\n113\n \n1\n \n454\n \n12\n \n567\n \n13\n \nMortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities\n7,359\n \n148\n \n1,419\n \n188\n \n8,778\n \n336\n \nCorporate and all other bonds\n7,341\n \n144\n \n21,999\n \n1,786\n \n29,340\n \n1,930\n \nTotal \n$\n23,954\n \n$\n454\n \n$\n41,709\n \n$\n4,378\n \n$\n65,663\n \n$\n4,832\n \n145\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

Net realized investment losses in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included $\n5\n million, $\n9\n million and $\n12\n million, respectively, of realized losses related to real estate.  Credit losses related to the fixed maturity portfolio for 2024 and 2023 represented less than \n1\n% of the fixed maturity portfolio on a pre-tax basis and less than \n1\n% of shareholders’ equity on an after-tax basis at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nConcentrations and Credit Quality\nConcentrations of credit risk arise from exposure to counterparties that are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that could cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.  The Company seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties, obtaining collateral as deemed appropriate and applying controls that include credit approvals, limits of credit exposure and other monitoring procedures.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, other than U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities, the Company was not exposed to any concentration of credit risk of a single issuer greater than \n5\n% of the Company’s shareholders’ equity.\nIncluded in fixed maturities are below investment grade securities totaling $\n980\n million and $\n982\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company defines its below investment grade securities as those securities rated below investment grade by external rating agencies, or the equivalent by the Company when a public rating does not exist.  Such securities include below investment grade bonds that are publicly traded and certain other privately issued bonds that are classified as below investment grade loans.\n148\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

The change in fair value of these investments is reported in net realized investment gains and losses.\n4.\n                                     \n \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company’s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance.  The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available.  The disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable.  In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s significant market assumptions.  The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety.  The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 \n-\n Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.\n•\nLevel 2 \n-\n Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n•\nLevel 3 \n-\n Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable.  The unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use.\n149\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n4.\n                                     \n \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)\nValuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e., not in a forced transaction.  The estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g., a forced transaction.  Additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.\nFor investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the Company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in Level 1 of the hierarchy.  The Company receives the quoted market prices from third party, nationally recognized pricing services.  When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes these pricing services to determine an estimate of fair value.  The fair value estimates provided from these pricing services are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy.  If quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the Company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as Level 2 or Level 3.  The Company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm’s length transaction.\nFixed Maturities\nThe Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately \n99\n% of its fixed maturities at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.  The pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets.  Since fixed maturities other than U.S. Treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing.  Additionally, the pricing service uses an Option Adjusted Spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.\nThe pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news.  The market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events.  The extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions.  Depending on the security, the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant.  For some securities, additional inputs may be necessary.\nThe pricing service utilized by the Company has indicated that it will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. If the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the Company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to make assumptions for any market-based inputs that were unavailable due to market conditions. The Company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the Company’s knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market. In addition, the Company has periodic discussions with the pricing service to discuss and understand any changes in process and their responsiveness to changes occurring in the markets. The Company also monitors all monthly price changes and further evaluates any securities whose value changed more than \n10\n% from the prior month. The Company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation (stale price review). The Company also uses a second  independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service’s valuation of the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio. These processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the primary pricing service.\nThe fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes.  Accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed maturities, other than U.S. Treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy.  The estimated fair value of U.S. Treasury securities is included in the amount disclosed in Level 1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.\n150\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n4.\n                                     \n \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)\nThe Company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and, accordingly, estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity.  The underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the U.S. Treasury curve are observable market-based indices that relate to corporate and high-yield fixed maturity investments.  The Company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in Level 2, since all significant inputs are market observable.  \nWhile the vast majority of the Company’s fixed maturities are included in Level 2, the Company holds a number of corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using either another internal pricing matrix, a present value income approach, or a broker quote (collectively, the other methodologies). The other methodologies include some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation.  Due to the limited amount of observable market information available in the estimation of fair value, the Company includes the fair value estimates for bonds that are valued using the other methodologies in Level 3.  \nEquity Securities — Common Stock and Non-Redeemable Preferred Stock\nFor public common stock and non-redeemable preferred stocks, the Company receives prices from pricing services that are based on observable market transactions and includes these estimates in the amount disclosed in Level 1.  When current market quotes in active markets are unavailable for certain non-redeemable preferred stocks held by the Company, the Company receives an estimate of fair value from the pricing services.  The services utilize similar methodologies to price the non-redeemable preferred stocks as they do for the fixed maturities. The Company includes the fair value estimate for these non-redeemable preferred stocks in the amount disclosed in Level 2.\nFor certain investments in non-public common and preferred equity securities, the fair value estimate is determined either internally or by an external fund manager based on the impact of recent observable transactions related to the investment, recent filings, operating results, balance sheet stability, growth and other business and market sector fundamentals.

Assumed reinsurance refers to the acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies have underwritten. Ceded reinsurance involves transferring certain insurance risks (along with the related written and earned premiums) the Company has underwritten to other insurance companies who agree to share these risks. The primary purpose of ceded reinsurance is to protect the Company, at a cost, from losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept and to protect the Company’s capital. Reinsurance is placed on both a quota-share and excess-of-loss basis.  Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not discharge \n155\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n6.\n                                     \n \nREINSURANCE (Continued)\nthe Company as the primary insurer, except for instances where the primary policy or policies have been novated, such as in certain structured settlement agreements.\nThe Company utilizes a corporate catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage its exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes and to protect its capital.  In addition to the coverage provided under this treaty, the Company also utilizes a reinsurance agreement entered into in connection with catastrophe bonds issued by Long Point Re IV to protect against certain weather-related and earthquake losses in the Northeastern United States and a Northeast property catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty to protect against losses resulting from weather-related and earthquake catastrophes in the Northeastern United States.  The Company also utilizes excess-of-loss treaties to protect against earthquake losses up to a certain threshold in Business Insurance (for certain markets) and for Personal Insurance, and several reinsurance treaties specific to its international operations.\nThe Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to evaluate the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers and as a basis for determining the reinsurers with which the Company conducts ongoing business.  In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may become involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers.  Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the Company’s rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.\nIncluded in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to involuntary reinsurance arrangements.  The Company is required to participate in various involuntary reinsurance arrangements through assumed reinsurance, principally with regard to residual market mechanisms in workers’ compensation and automobile insurance, as well as homeowners’ insurance in certain coastal areas. In addition, the Company provides services for several of these involuntary arrangements (mandatory pools and associations) under which it writes such residual market business directly, then cedes \n100\n% of this business to the mandatory pool.  Such participations and servicing arrangements are arranged to mitigate credit risk to the Company, as any ceded balances are jointly backed by all the pool members.\nAlso included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to certain structured settlements.  Structured settlements are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers’ compensation claims comprise a significant portion.  In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant.  If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations.  In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments.\nThe following is a summary of reinsurance financial data reflected in the consolidated statement of income:\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWritten premiums\nDirect\n$\n44,377\n \n$\n40,983\n \n$\n36,648\n \nAssumed\n2,173\n \n1,989\n \n1,228\n \nCeded\n(\n3,194\n)\n(\n2,771\n)\n(\n2,462\n)\nTotal net written premiums\n$\n43,356\n \n$\n40,201\n \n$\n35,414\n \nEarned premiums\nDirect\n$\n42,983\n \n$\n38,796\n \n$\n34,948\n \nAssumed\n2,095\n \n1,614\n \n1,145\n \nCeded\n(\n3,137\n)\n(\n2,649\n)\n(\n2,330\n)\nTotal net earned premiums\n$\n41,941\n \n$\n37,761\n \n$\n33,763\n \nPercentage of assumed earned premiums to net earned premiums\n5.0\n \n%\n4.3\n \n%\n3.4\n \n%\nCeded claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred\n$\n1,249\n \n$\n1,462\n \n$\n1,187\n \nCeded premiums include the premiums paid for coverage provided by the Company’s catastrophe bonds.\n156\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

All commercial property and casualty insurers licensed in the United States are generally required to participate in the program. Under the program, a participating insurer, in exchange for making terrorism insurance available, is entitled to be reimbursed by the Federal Government for \n80\n% of subject losses, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap.  \nThe deductible for any calendar year is equal to \n20\n% of the insurer’s direct earned premiums for covered lines for the preceding calendar year.  The Company’s estimated deductible under the program is $\n3.85\n billion for 2025.  The annual cap limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $\n100\n billion.  Once subject losses have reached the $\n100\n billion aggregate during a program year, participating insurers will not be liable under the program for additional covered terrorism losses for that program year.  There have been \nno\n terrorism-related losses that have triggered program coverage since the program was established.  Given that the law establishing the program remains untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied if an act of terrorism is certified under the program.  In addition, application of the program to a specific event will depend upon whether the government has designated such event as a covered event. It is also possible that future legislative action could change or eliminate the program.  Further, given the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism losses, as well as the limited terrorism coverage in the Company’s own reinsurance program, future losses from acts of terrorism, particularly involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could be material to the Company’s operating results, financial position and/or liquidity in future periods. In addition, the Company may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising from a high frequency of high severity natural catastrophes and/or of man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means.  While the Company seeks to manage its exposure to man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means, the Company may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or more man-made catastrophic events involving cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological means.\n157\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

The customer-related intangible assets include Corvus’s broker and policyholder relationships and were valued using the excess earnings method income approach, a valuation technique that provides an estimate of fair value based on the cash flows that the asset can be expected to generate over its remaining useful life. Broker relationships represent the relationships Corvus has with its existing brokers through which new business is placed with policyholders. Policyholder relationships represent the renewal of existing policies. Significant inputs to the fair valuation include estimates of revenue growth, broker retention rates, policyholder attrition rates and weighted average cost of capital.\n158\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n7.\n                                     \n \nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Continued)\n(2)\nContract-based intangible assets subject to amortization are comprised of fair value adjustments on claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, reinsurance recoverables and other contract-related intangible assets.  Fair value adjustments recorded in connection with insurance acquisitions were based on management’s estimate of nominal claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables.  The method used calculated a risk adjustment to a risk-free discounted reserve that would, if reserves ran off as expected, produce results that yielded the assumed cost-of-capital on the capital supporting the loss reserves.  The fair value adjustments are reported as other intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheet, and the amounts measured in accordance with the acquirer’s accounting policies for insurance contracts have been reported as part of the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables.  The intangible assets are being recognized into income over the expected payment pattern.  Because the time value of money and the risk adjustment (cost of capital) components of the intangible assets run off at different rates, the amount recognized in income may be a net benefit in some periods and a net expense in other periods.\n(3)\nMarketing-related intangibles of $\n18\n million were recorded in connection with the acquisition of Corvus in the first quarter of 2024. The marketing-related intangible assets include trade names and a non-compete agreement. The trade names were valued using a relief from royalty method, a valuation technique which estimates the fair value of an asset based on the present value of the royalties saved because the company owns the asset.  Significant inputs to the fair valuation include estimates of future revenue, appropriate rates of return associated with certain assets and weighted average cost of capital.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n8.\n                                     \n \nINSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)\nMethodology for Estimating Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) Reserves\nClaims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management’s estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) as of the balance sheet date.  Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability, but instead represent management estimates, primarily utilizing actuarial expertise and projection methods that develop estimates for the ultimate cost of claims and claim adjustment expenses.  Because the establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates and judgment, currently estimated claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change.  The Company reflects changes to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.\nCumulative amounts paid and case reserves held as of the balance sheet date are subtracted from the estimate of the ultimate cost of claims and claim adjustment expenses to derive incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves.  Accordingly, IBNR reserves include the cost of unreported claims, development on known claims and re-opened claims.  This approach to estimating IBNR reserves has been in place for many years, with no material changes in methodology in the past year.\nDetailed claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication of the initial estimate for ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year.  As a result, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on an exposure-based method using either the loss ratio projection or the expected loss method.  The loss ratio projection method, which is typically used for guaranteed-cost business, develops an initial estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year by multiplying earned premium for the accident year by a projected loss ratio.  The projected loss ratio is determined by analyzing prior period experience, and adjusting for loss cost trends, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the accident year relative to prior accident years.  The expected loss method, which is typically used for loss sensitive business, develops an initial estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year by analyzing exposures by account.\nFor prior accident years, the following estimation and analysis methods are principally used by the Company’s actuaries to estimate the ultimate cost of claims and claim adjustment expenses.  These estimation and analysis methods are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods.\n•\nThe paid loss development method assumes that the future change (positive or negative) in cumulative paid losses for a given cohort of claims will occur in a stable, predictable pattern from year-to-year, consistent with the pattern observed in past cohorts.\n•\nThe case incurred development method is the same as the paid loss development method but is based on cumulative case-incurred losses rather than paid losses.\n•\nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses an initial estimate of ultimate losses for a given product line reserve component, typically expressed as a ratio to earned premium.  The method assumes that the ratio of additional claim activity to earned premium for that component is relatively stable and predictable over time and that actual claim activity to date is not a credible predictor of further activity for that component.  The method is used most often for more recent accident years where claim data is sparse and/or volatile, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible.\n•\nThe average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method assumes that average claim values are stable and predictable over time for a particular cohort of claims.  It is typically limited to analysis at more granular levels, such as coverage or hazard/peril, where a more homogeneous subset of claims produce a more stable and fairly predictable average value.  The reported claim development method is the same as the paid loss development method but uses changes in cumulative claim counts to produce estimates of ultimate claim counts rather than ultimate dollars.  The resulting estimate of ultimate claim counts by cohort is multiplied by an average value per claim from an average value analysis to obtain estimated ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses.\nWhile these are the principal methods utilized, the Company’s actuaries have available to them the full range of actuarial methods developed by the casualty actuarial profession.  The Company’s actuaries are also regularly monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates.  Most actuarial methods assume that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the \n174\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n8.\n                                     \n \nINSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)\nfuture.  For certain reserve components where this assumption may not hold, such as asbestos and environmental reserves, conventional actuarial methods are not utilized by the Company.\nMethodology for Determining Cumulative Number of Reported Claims\nA claim file is created when the Company is notified of an actual demand for payment, notified of an event that may lead to a demand for payment or when it is determined that a demand for payment could possibly lead to a future demand for payment on another coverage on the same policy or on another policy.  Claim files are generally created for a policy at the claimant by coverage level, depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the underlying event.\nFor Business Insurance and for Personal Insurance, claim file information is summarized such that the Company generally recognizes one count for each policy claim event by internal regulatory line of business, regardless of the number of claimants or coverages involved.  The claims counts are then accumulated and reported by product line.  While the methodology is generally consistent within each segment for the product lines displayed, there are some minor differences between and within segments.  For Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company generally recognizes one count per coverage per policy claim event and one count per bond per surety claim event.\nFor purposes of the claims development tables above, claims reported for direct business are counted even if they eventually close with no loss payment, except in the case of (i) deductible business, where the claim is not counted until the case incurred claim estimate is above the deductible and (ii) International-Canada reported claim counts where claims closed with no loss payment are not counted.  Note that claims with zero claim dollars may still generate some level of claim adjustment expenses.  Claim counts for assumed business are included only to the extent such counts are available. The Company generally does not receive claim count information for which the underlying claim activity is handled by others, including pools and associations.  The Company does not generate claim counts for ceded business. The methods used to summarize claim counts have not changed significantly over the time periods reported in the tables above.\nThe Company cautions against using the summarized claim count information provided in this disclosure in attempting to project ultimate loss payouts by product line. The Company generally finds claim count data to be useful only on a more granular basis than the aggregated basis disclosed in the claim development tables above, as the risks, average values and other dynamics of the claim process can vary materially by the cause of loss and coverage within product line.  For example, in Personal Automobile, the introduction of roadside assistance coverage resulted in a significant increase in claim counts with a low average claim cost.  For this reason the Company varies its approach to, and in many cases the level of aggregation for, counting claims for internal analysis purposes depending on the particular granular analysis performed.\nAsbestos and Environmental Reserves\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s claims and claim adjustment expense reserves included $\n1.72\n billion and $\n1.76\n billion, respectively, for asbestos and environmental-related claims, net of reinsurance.\nIt is difficult to estimate the reserves for asbestos and environmental-related claims due to the vagaries of court coverage decisions, plaintiffs’ expanded theories of liability, the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, including, without limitation, those which are set forth below.\nAsbestos Reserves\n.  Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally conducts an in-depth asbestos claim review on an annual basis, including a review of domestic policyholders with open claims and litigation cases for potential product and “non-product” liability.  Policyholders are identified for this review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $\n100,000\n), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential “non-product” exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder.\nAmong the factors the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder’s potential liability, including as a result of the bankruptcy of other defendants; the jurisdictions involved, including any trends, judicial rulings or legislative actions in those jurisdictions; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; the potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and \n175\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n8.\n                                     \n \nINSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)\napplicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.\nThe Company also reviews its asbestos reserves quarterly.  These reviews include, as appropriate, an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions.  The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders and the assumed reinsurance component of reserves, as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity.  Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves, and the Company’s evaluations have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment. \nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review.  While the latest available government data continue to reflect a declining trend in deaths caused by mesothelioma, the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims was relatively flat compared to 2023.  Net asbestos paid claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n282\n million, $\n212\n million and $\n245\n million, respectively.  Payments on behalf of these policyholders continue to be influenced by the factors described above, including an increase in severity for certain policyholders and a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, primarily mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally sued and/or primary targets of asbestos litigation. The completion of the analyses described above and the annual review in the third quarters of 2024, 2023 and 2022 resulted in $\n242\n million, $\n284\n million and $\n212\n million increases, respectively, to the Company’s net asbestos reserves.  In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company’s estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders.  The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs primarily resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the continued high level of mesothelioma claim filings and the impact of the current litigation environment surrounding those claims discussed above. The 2023 charge also included an additional increase to strengthen the Company’s carried reserve position relative to the range of reasonable estimates. \nOver the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company’s overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company’s overall view of the current underlying\n \nasbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.\nEnvironmental Reserves\n.  In establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. These claims are mainly brought pursuant to various state or federal statutes that require a liable party to undertake or pay for environmental remediation.  Liability under these statutes may be joint and several with other responsible parties.  In the course of its analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations.  In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction.  The evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed.  Conventional actuarial methods are not used to estimate these reserves.\nOver the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time, the number of policyholders with open environmental claims and the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters.  These policyholders continue to present smaller \n176\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n8.\n                                     \n \nINSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)\nexposures, are involved in fewer hazardous waste sites and are lower tier defendants than policyholders presenting such claims in the past.  Moreover, more efficient clean-up technologies have reduced clean-up costs in many instances depending on the remedy chosen at sites.   However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated.  In addition, inflationary impacts on consulting and contractor costs, increased involvement of regulatory agencies and costs of their involvement, and the application of more stringent cleanup standards, including on emerging contaminants, has contributed to reserve development on existing environmental claims. Additionally, the costs associated with coverage litigation on environmental matters has been greater than anticipated, driven by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As a result of these factors, in 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $\n78\n million, $\n93\n million and $\n132\n million, respectively.\nAsbestos and Environmental Reserves.\n As a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management’s judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. Changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment may impact the future resolution of asbestos and environmental claims and result in adverse loss reserve development.  The emergence of a greater number of asbestos or environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated may result in adverse loss reserve development.  Changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims, could affect the settlement of asbestos and environmental claims.  It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.\nBecause of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company’s current reserves.  In addition, the Company’s estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change.  These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company’s operating results in future periods.\nCatastrophe Exposure\nThe Company has geographic exposure to catastrophe losses, which include hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar flares and other naturally-occurring events.  Catastrophes can also result from terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts including those involving cyber events, nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, civil unrest, explosions and destruction of infrastructure.  The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires and cyber attacks may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. The Company generally seeks to mitigate its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance.\nThere are also risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes.  For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of the Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves.  Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; the potential impact of changing climate conditions, including higher frequency and severity of weather-related events; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage and business income interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility.  The timing of a catastrophe’s occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting period.  The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.\n177\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

Interest rates on commercial paper issued in 2024 ranged from \n4.59\n% to \n5.36\n%, and in 2023 ranged from \n4.29\n% to \n5.34\n%.\nSenior Notes\n—The Company’s various senior debt issues are unsecured obligations that rank equally with one another.  Interest payments are made semi-annually.  The Company generally may redeem some or all of the notes prior to maturity in accordance with terms unique to each debt instrument.\nThe Travelers Companies, Inc. fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment of all principal, premiums, if any, and interest on certain debt obligations of its subsidiaries Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) and Travelers Insurance Group Holdings Inc. (TIGHI). The guarantees pertain to the $\n200\n million \n7.75\n% notes due 2026 and the $\n500\n million \n6.375\n% notes due 2033.\nJunior Subordinated Debentures\n—The Company’s \nthree\n junior subordinated debenture instruments are all similar in nature to each other.  \nThree\n separate business trusts issued preferred securities to investors and used the proceeds to purchase the Company’s junior subordinated debentures.  Interest on each of the instruments is paid semi-annually.\nThe Company’s consolidated balance sheet includes the debt instruments acquired in a business acquisition, which were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The resulting fair value adjustment is being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments using the effective-interest method. The amortization of the fair value adjustment reduced interest expense by $\n1\n million and $\n3\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table presents merger-related unamortized fair value adjustments:\nUnamortized Fair Value\nPurchase Adjustment at December 31,\n(in millions)\nIssue Rate\nMaturity Date\n2024\n2023\nJunior subordinated debentures\n7.625\n \n%\nDec. 2027\n$\n5\n \n$\n6\n \n8.500\n \n%\nDec. 2045\n13\n \n13\n \n8.312\n \n%\nJul. 2046\n16\n \n16\n \nTotal\n$\n34\n \n$\n35\n \nMaturities\n—Other than commercial paper, the amount of debt obligations that become due in each of the next five years is as follows: 2025, $\n0\n; 2026, $\n200\n million; 2027, $\n125\n million; 2028, $\n0\n; and 2029, $\n0\n.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 15, 2022, the Company entered into to a \nfive-year\n, $\n1.0\n billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, replacing its \nfive-year\n, $\n1.0\n billion credit agreement  that was due to expire on June 4, 2023.  \nPursuant to the credit agreement covenants, the Company must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, defined as shareholders’ equity determined in accordance with GAAP (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) plus (a) trust preferred securities (not to exceed \n15\n% of total capital) and (b) mandatorily convertible securities (combined with trust preferred securities, not to exceed \n25\n% of total capital), less goodwill and other intangible assets.  That threshold is fixed during the term of the credit agreement at an amount equal to $\n13.9\n billion (\n57.5\n% of the Company’s net worth at March 31, 2022).  In addition, the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of default, including with respect to a change in control, which would occur upon the acquisition of \n35\n% or more of the Company’s voting stock or certain changes in the composition of the Company’s Board of Directors.\n  \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\n  Generally, the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\nSOFR\n) plus \n85\n basis points (including a credit spread adjustment) to \nSOFR\n plus \n147.5\n basis points (including a credit spread adjustment), depending on the Company’s credit ratings.  At December 31, 2024, that cost would have been \nSOFR\n plus \n110\n basis points (including a credit spread adjustment), had there been any amounts outstanding under the credit agreement. \nThe Company has uncollateralized letters of credit with an aggregate limit of $\n306\n million at December 31, 2024, including $\n260\n million that provides a portion of the capital needed to support the Company’s obligations at Lloyd’s.\n179\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n9.\n                                     \n \nDEBT (Continued)\nShelf Registration\nThe Company has a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that expires on June 8, 2025 which permits it to issue securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering.\n \n10.\n                                     \n \nSHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY\nAuthorized Shares\nThe number of authorized shares of the Company is \n1.755\n billion, consisting of \nfive million\n shares of preferred stock, \n1.745\n billion shares of voting common stock and \nfive million\n undesignated shares.  The Company’s Articles of Incorporation authorize the Board of Directors to establish, from the undesignated shares, one or more classes and series of shares, and to further designate the type of shares and terms thereof.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company’s Articles of Incorporation provide authority to issue up to \nfive million\n shares of preferred stock.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company is governed by the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. All authorized shares of voting common stock have no par value.  Shares of common stock reacquired are considered authorized and unissued shares.\nTreasury Stock\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise.  The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date.  The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company’s business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company’s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws and other factors.  In April 2023, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization that added an additional $\n5.0\n billion of repurchase capacity.  During 2024, the Company repurchased \n4.4\n million shares under its share repurchase authorizations, for a total of $\n1.0\n billion.  The average cost per share repurchased was $\n225.44\n.  Included in the cost of treasury stock acquired pursuant to common share repurchases is the 1% excise tax imposed on common share repurchase activity, net of common share issuances, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.  At December 31, 2024, the Company had $\n5.04\n billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorizations.\nThe Company’s Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2023 Stock Incentive Plan provide settlement alternatives to employees in which the Company retains shares to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and shares used by employees to cover the exercise price, as well as the related payroll withholding taxes, with respect to certain stock options that were exercised.  During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company acquired $\n146\n million and $\n64\n million, respectively, of its common stock under these plans.\nCommon shares acquired are reported as treasury stock in the consolidated balance sheet.\n180\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n10.\n                                     \n \nSHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY (Continued)\nDividend Availability\nThe Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the State of Connecticut, are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid by each insurance subsidiary to its respective parent company without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. A maximum of $\n4.17\n billion is available by the end of 2025 for such dividends to ultimately be paid to the holding company, TRV, without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department.  The Company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2025 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2025, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the Connecticut Insurance Department prior to payment.\nEach of the Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders’ surplus at December 31, 2024 significantly above the level at which any regulatory action would occur. Regulators in the jurisdictions in which the Company’s foreign insurance subsidiaries are located require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance policies written. Each of the Company’s foreign insurance subsidiaries also had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at December 31, 2024.\nIn addition to the regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends that can be paid by the Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid to the Company’s shareholders is also limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth as described in note 9.\nTRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs.  The undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company’s financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2024.\nThe U.S. insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of $\n2.00\n billion, $\n1.17\n billion and $\n2.90\n billion during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, TRV declared cash dividends per common share of $\n4.15\n, $\n3.93\n and $\n3.67\n, respectively, and paid cash dividends of $\n951\n million, $\n908\n million and $\n875\n million, respectively.\nStatutory Net Income and Statutory Capital and Surplus\nStatutory net income of the Company’s domestic and international insurance subsidiaries was $\n4.74\n billion, $\n2.85\n billion and $\n2.62\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus of the Company’s domestic and international insurance subsidiaries was $\n27.72\n billion and $\n25.11\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n181\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

The Company has a \n188\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2014 Incentive Plan) was terminated, joining several other legacy share-based incentive compensation plans that had been terminated in prior years (together, the legacy plans). Outstanding grants were not affected by the termination of the legacy plans.  The 2023 Incentive Plan is currently the only plan pursuant to which future stock-based awards may be granted.\nThe number of shares of the Company’s common stock initially authorized for grant under the 2023 Incentive Plan was \n5,789,184\n shares.  The following are not counted towards the combined \n5,789,184\n shares available and will be available for future grants under the 2023 Incentive Plan: (i) shares of common stock subject to awards that expire unexercised, that are forfeited, terminated or canceled, that are settled in cash or other forms of property, or otherwise do not result in the issuance of shares of common stock, in whole or in part; (ii) shares that are used to pay the exercise price of stock options and shares used to pay withholding taxes on awards generally; and (iii) shares purchased by the Company on the open market using cash option exercise proceeds; provided, however, that the increase in the number of shares of common stock available for grant pursuant to such market purchases shall not be greater than the number that could be repurchased at fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock option giving rise to such option proceeds.  In addition, the \n5,789,184\n shares authorized by shareholders for issuance under the 2023 Incentive Plan will be increased by any shares subject to awards under the 2014 Incentive Plan that were outstanding as of May 24, 2023 and subsequently expire, are forfeited, canceled, settled in cash or otherwise terminate without the issuance of shares.\nThe Company also has a compensation program for non-employee directors (the Director Compensation Program). Under the Director Compensation Program, non-employee directors’ compensation consists of an annual retainer, a deferred stock award, committee chair fees and a lead director fee.  Each non-employee director may choose to receive all or a portion of his or her annual retainer, committee chair fee and lead director fee, as applicable, in the form of cash or deferred stock units which vest upon grant.  The annual deferred stock awards vest in full \none day\n prior to the date of the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders occurring in the year following the year of the grant date, subject to continued service. The annual deferred stock awards, including dividend equivalents, accumulate until distribution either in a lump sum or, if the director so elects, in annual installments, in each case beginning at least \nsix months\n following termination of service as a director. The deferred stock units issued under the Director Compensation Program are awarded under the 2023 Incentive Plan.\nStock Option Awards\nStock option awards granted to eligible officers and key employees have a \nten-year\n term.  All stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.  The stock options granted generally vest upon meeting certain years of service criteria. Except as the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may allow in the future, stock options cannot be sold or transferred by the participant.  Stock options outstanding under the 2023 Incentive Plan and the 2014 Incentive Plan generally vest \nthree years\n after grant date (cliff vest).\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant by application of a variation of the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the assumptions noted in the following table. The expected term of newly granted stock options is the time to vest plus half the remaining time to expiration. This considers the vesting restrictions and represents an even pattern of exercise behavior over the remaining term. The expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock for the same period as the estimated option term generally using the volatility of the week prior to the stock option grant.  The expected dividend is based upon the Company’s current quarter dividend annualized and assumed to be constant over the expected option term. The risk-free interest rate for each option is the interpolated market yield of a U.S. Treasury bill with a term comparable to the expected option term for the same week used for measuring volatility.  \nThe following table provides information about options granted:\n189\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

The fair value attributable to the stock option awards on the date of grant was $\n68.92\n per share.\nRestricted Stock Units, Deferred Stock Units and Performance Share Award Programs\nThe Company issues restricted stock unit awards to eligible officers and key employees under the Equity Awards program pursuant to the 2023 Incentive Plan.  A restricted stock unit represents the right to receive a share of common stock. These restricted stock unit awards are granted at market price, generally vest \nthree years\n from the date of grant, do not have voting rights and the underlying shares of common stock are not issued until the vesting criteria is satisfied.  In addition, members of the Company’s Board of Directors can be issued deferred stock units from (i) an annual award; (ii) deferred compensation (in lieu of cash retainer, committee chair fees and lead director fees); and (iii) dividend equivalents earned on outstanding deferred compensation.\nThe Company also has a Performance Share Awards program pursuant to the 2023 Incentive Plan. Under the program, the Company may issue performance share awards to certain employees of the Company who hold positions of Vice President (or its equivalent) or above. The performance share awards provide the recipient the right to earn shares of the Company’s common stock based upon the Company’s attainment of certain performance goals and the recipient meeting certain years of service criteria. The performance goals for performance share awards are based on the Company’s adjusted return on equity over a \nthree-year\n performance period.  Vesting of performance shares is contingent upon the Company attaining the relevant performance period minimum threshold return on equity and the recipient meeting certain years of service criteria, generally \n190\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

If the performance period return on equity is below the minimum threshold, \nnone\n of the performance shares will vest.  If performance meets or exceeds the minimum performance threshold, a range of performance shares will vest (\n50\n% to \n200\n% for awards granted in 2023 and 2024), depending on the actual return on equity attained.\nThe fair value of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance shares was measured at the market price of the Company stock at date of grant.  Under terms of the 2023 Incentive Plan, holders of deferred stock units and performance shares may receive dividend equivalents.\nThe total fair value of shares that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n253\n million, $\n164\n million and $\n159\n million, respectively.\nA summary of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance share activity under the 2023 Incentive Plan and the legacy plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:\nRestricted and Deferred Stock\nUnits\nPerformance Shares\nOther Equity Instruments\nNumber\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nNumber\nWeighted Average\nGrant-Date Fair\nValue\nNonvested, beginning of year\n1,025,695\n \n$\n167.98\n \n1,004,799\n \n$\n180.87\n \nGranted\n632,770\n \n210.23\n \n282,921\n \n213.01\n \nVested\n(\n500,718\n)\n(1)\n164.60\n \n(\n575,266\n)\n(2)\n172.50\n \nForfeited\n(\n56,758\n)\n186.74\n \n(\n9,156\n)\n189.68\n \nPerformance-based adjustment\n— \n— \n452,350\n \n(3)\n200.86\n \nNonvested, end of year\n1,100,989\n \n$\n192.83\n \n1,155,648\n \n$\n200.66\n \n___________________________________________\n(1)\nRepresents awards for which the requisite service has been rendered.\n(2)\nReflects the number of performance shares attributable to the performance goals attained over the completed performance period (\nthree years\n) and for which service conditions have been met.\n(3)\nRepresents the current year change in estimated performance shares to reflect the attainment of performance goals for the awards that were granted in each of the years 2022 through 2024.\n \nIn addition to the nonvested shares presented in the above table, there are related nonvested dividend equivalent shares.  The number of nonvested dividend equivalent shares related to deferred stock units was \n260\n at the beginning of the year and \n165\n at the end of the year and the number of nonvested dividend equivalent shares related to performance shares was \n33,757\n at the beginning of the year and \n35,112\n at the end of the year.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n14.\n                                     \n \nSHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (Continued)\nShare-Based Compensation Cost Recognition\nThe amount of compensation cost for awards subject to a service condition is based on the number of shares expected to be issued and is recognized over the time period for which service is to be provided (requisite service period), generally the vesting period.  Awards granted to retiree-eligible employees or to employees who become retiree-eligible before an award’s vesting date are considered to have met the requisite service condition if the vesting terms are accelerated upon retirement. The compensation cost for awards subject to a performance condition is based upon the probable outcome of the performance condition, which on the grant date reflects an estimate of attaining \n100\n% of the performance shares granted.  The compensation cost reflects an estimated annual forfeiture rate from \n1.5\n% to \n3.5\n% over the requisite service period of the awards. That estimate is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments expected to vest is likely to differ from previous estimates.  Compensation costs for awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  For awards that have graded vesting terms, the compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The total compensation cost for all share-based incentive compensation awards recognized in earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n260\n million, $\n214\n million and $\n183\n million, respectively. Included in these amounts are compensation cost adjustments of $\n68\n million, $\n39\n million and $\n23\n million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, that reflected the cost associated with the updated estimate of performance shares due to attaining certain performance levels from the date of the initial grant of the performance awards.  The related tax benefits recognized in earnings were $\n43\n million, $\n36\n million and $\n31\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2024, there was $\n248\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested share-based incentive compensation awards. This includes stock options, restricted and deferred stock units and performance shares granted under the 2023 Incentive Plan. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n1.8\n years.  Cash received from the exercise of employee stock options under share-based compensation plans totaled $\n321\n million, $\n141\n million and $\n267\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The tax benefit for tax deductions from employee stock options exercised during 2024, 2023 and 2022 totaled $\n39\n million, $\n11\n million and $\n22\n million, respectively.\nAwards Made Subsequent to the Balance Sheet Date\nOn February 4, 2025, the Company granted \n685,943\n common stock awards in the form of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance share awards under the 2023 Incentive Plan to participating officers, non-employee directors and other key employees.\nIncluded in the total common stock awards granted were \n432,987\n shares of restricted stock units and deferred stock units with a fair value per share attributable to the units of $\n244.06\n.\nThe remaining common stock awards granted were \n252,956\n performance share awards, which are settled in common stock and are contingent on the Company’s attainment of certain performance and market-based goals over the performance period and the recipient meeting certain years of service.\n \nThe percentage of shares that may vest at the end of the performance period is subject to the attainment of identified return-on-equity (ROE) performance goals, and is adjusted (up or down) based on the Company’s total shareholder return relative to the S&P Financials Index. The range of performance shares that may vest under the Plan is \n0\n% to \n200\n%.

After 2025, assumed health care cost trend rates are expected to increase in the subsequent year and then are expected to decrease in a linear pattern until the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate of \n4.50\n% in 2033.  The 2024 assumed health care cost trend rate of (\n2.78\n)% reflects known negotiated medical premium rate changes to the Company’s baseline health care cost trend rate of \n8.00\n%.\n \nThe discount rate assumption used to determine the \nbenefit obligation\n is based on a yield-curve approach. Under this approach, individual spot rates from the yield curve of a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed maturity corporate bonds (rated Aa) available at the year-end valuation date, for which the timing and amount of cash outflows correspond with the timing and amount of the estimated benefit payouts of the Company’s benefit plan, are applied to expected future benefits payments in measuring the projected \nbenefit obligation\n.

Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial position. The asset mix guidelines have been established and are reviewed quarterly. These guidelines are intended to serve as tools to facilitate the investment of plan assets to maximize long-term total return and the ongoing oversight of the plan’s investment performance.  Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through daily and monthly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability studies.\nThe Company’s overall investment strategy for the qualified domestic pension plan is to achieve a mix of approximately \n85\n% to \n90\n% of investments for long-term growth and \n10\n% to \n15\n% for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers.  The current target allocations for plan assets are \n55\n% to \n65\n% equity securities and \n20\n% to \n40\n% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities.  Equity securities primarily include investments in large, medium and small-cap companies primarily located in the United States.  Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities and debt securities issued by foreign governments.\nAssets of the Company’s foreign pension plans are not significant.\nFair Value Measurement — Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Assets\nFor a discussion of the methods employed by the Company to measure the fair value of invested assets, see note 4.  The following discussion of fair value measurements applies exclusively to the Company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefit assets.\nFair value estimates for equity and bond mutual funds held by the pension plans reflect prices received from an external pricing service that are based on observable market transactions.  These estimates are primarily included in Level 1.\nShort-term securities are carried at fair value which approximates cost plus accrued interest or amortized discount.  The fair value or market value of these is periodically compared to this amortized cost and is based on significant observable inputs as determined by an external pricing service.  Accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such short-term securities, other than U.S. Treasury securities and money market mutual funds, provided by an external pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy.  The estimated fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and money market mutual funds is included in the amount disclosed in Level 1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.\nFair Value Hierarchy — Pension Plans\nThe following tables present the level within the fair value hierarchy at which the financial assets of the Company’s pension plans are measured on a recurring basis.\n198\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

The Company’s non-U.S. employees and certain domestic employees participate in separate savings plans.  The total expense related to all of the savings plans was $\n170\n million, $\n154\n million and $\n139\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAll common shares held by the Savings Plan are considered outstanding for basic and diluted EPS computations and dividends paid on all shares are charged to retained earnings.\n16.\n                                     \n \nLEASES\nThe Company enters into lease agreements for real estate that is primarily used for office space in the ordinary course of business.  These leases are accounted for as operating leases, whereby lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and a right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognized as part of other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet. \nMost leases include an option to extend or renew the lease term.  The exercise of the renewal option is at the Company’s discretion.  The operating lease liability includes lease payments related to options to extend or renew the lease term if the Company is reasonably certain of exercising those options.  The Company, in determining the present value of lease payments, \n200\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n17.\n                                     \n \nCONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (Continued)\nAsbestos and Environmental Claims and Litigation\nIn the ordinary course of its insurance business, the Company has received and continues to receive claims for insurance arising under policies issued by the Company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage litigation. The Company is defending asbestos- and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses; however, the outcomes of these disputes are uncertain.  In this regard, the Company employs dedicated specialists and comprehensive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under appropriate circumstances.  Currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and their impact on future loss development for claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. Any such development could be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as future changes, if any, in applicable legislation. Because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company’s current insurance reserves. In addition, the Company’s estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or changes in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company’s results of operations in future periods.\nOther Proceedings Not Arising Under Insurance Contracts or Reinsurance Agreements\nThe Company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages relating to insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements.  The legal costs associated with such lawsuits are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.  Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the Company’s results of operations or would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or liquidity.\nOther Commitments and Guarantees\nCommitments\nInvestment Commitments\n — The Company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships, real estate partnerships and other investments.  These commitments totaled $\n1.49\n billion and $\n2.05\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nGuarantees\nIn the ordinary course of selling businesses to third parties, the Company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of representations and warranties, obligations arising from certain liabilities and any breach or failure to perform certain covenants with respect to the businesses being sold.  Such indemnification provisions generally are applicable from the closing date to the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations, although, in some cases, there may be agreed upon term limitations or no term limitations.  Certain of these contingent obligations are subject to deductibles which have to be incurred by the obligee before the Company is obligated to make payments.  The maximum amount of the Company’s contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of businesses that are quantifiable was $\n351\n million at December 31, 2024. \nThe Company also has contingent obligations for guarantees related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications.  The Company also provides standard indemnifications that it utilizes with service providers in the normal course of business.  The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms.  The maximum amount of the Company’s obligation related to the guarantee of certain insurance policy obligations of a former insurance subsidiary was $\n480\n million at December 31, 2024, all of which is indemnified by a third party.\nCertain of the guarantees and indemnifications described above have no stated or notional amounts or limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and, accordingly, the Company is unable to provide an estimate of the maximum potential payments for such arrangements.  The Company does not expect to make any material payments related to these guarantees.\n202\nTHE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n18.\n                                     \n \nNONCASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nDuring 2024, the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association, a FAIR Plan of which the Company was a member, was restructured from a partnership that shares profits and losses with Member Companies to a joint underwriting association, or JUA, that is a stand-alone, risk-bearing entity.  This restructuring included a noncash exchange of the Company’s share of undistributed members’ equity for a beneficial interest in a new Fair Plan Trust which resulted in noncash investing activity totaling $\n32\n million.  In unrelated transactions, the Company issued common stock during 2024 in connection with its stock compensation plan which resulted in noncash financing transactions totaling $\n32\n million from the net share settlement of employee stock options.\nThere were no other material noncash financing or investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n203\nItem 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNot Applicable.\nItem 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management’s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, management is excluding an assessment of such internal controls for Corvus Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Corvus) from its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Corvus on January 2, 2024. Corvus represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated total assets, consolidated total revenues and net income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.\nIn addition, there was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of Corvus and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as it integrates Corvus into the Company’s overall internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company regularly seeks to identify, develop and implement improvements to its technology systems and business processes, some of which may affect its internal control over financial reporting. These changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems or platforms, automating manual processes or utilizing technology developed by third parties.  These systems changes are often phased in over multiple periods in order to limit the implementation risk in any one period, and as each change is implemented the Company monitors its effectiveness as part of its internal control over financial reporting. \n204\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s accounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Company’s Audit Committee.\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; \n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and \n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nManagement has assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are the measures in the \nInternal Control ‑ Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \nBased upon its assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2024, and that there were no material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of that date.\nKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-K, has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting which follows this report. \n205\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors \nThe Travelers Companies, Inc.: \nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited The Travelers Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control –\n \nIntegrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules as listed in the index to consolidated financial statements and schedules (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company acquired Corvus Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Corvus) during 2024, and management excluded an assessment of Corvus’ internal control from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Corvus represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated total assets, consolidated total revenues and net income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Corvus.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n206\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nKPMG LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 13, 2025\n207\nItem 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) \nadopted\n, \nterminated\n or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933). \nItem 9C.    DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\nPART III\nItem 10.    DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nExecutive Officers of the Company\nSet forth below is information concerning the Company’s executive officers as of February 13, 2025.\nName\nAge\nOffice\nAlan D.
