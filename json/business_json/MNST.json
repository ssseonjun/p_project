    "item1a": "Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of aluminum cans, as well as sugar, sucralose and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, juice concentrates, milk, cream, coffee, tea, hops, malt and yeast, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, tariffs, as well as limitations in the availability of aluminum cans and certain other raw materials and packaging materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. \nWe do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and, except for aluminum, generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices.\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 40% and 38% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2024 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.\nWe have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in interest and other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2024 to be significant.\nITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe information required to be furnished in response to this Item 8 follows the signature page and Index to Exhibits hereto at pages 72 through 118.\n​\nITEM 9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\n​\nITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n –\n \nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms of the SEC and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n – Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our management’s evaluation under the framework in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n – There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n​\n​\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n​\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Monster Beverage Corporation and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Monster Beverage Corporation and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Monster Beverage Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Monster Beverage Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index in Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”) of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nIrvine, California\n​\nFebruary 28, 2025\n​\n​\nITEM 9B.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three-months ended December 31, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers \nadopted\n, \nmodified\n or \nterminated\n a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).\n​\nITEM 9C.\nDISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICITONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\n​\n64\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPART III\nITEM 10.\nDIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe information required by this item regarding our directors is included under the caption “Proposal One – Election of Directors” in our Proxy Statement for our 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (the “2025 Proxy Statement”) and is incorporated herein by reference.\nInformation concerning compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act is included under the caption “Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports” in our 2025 Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference.\nInformation concerning the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee Financial Expert is reported under the caption “Audit Committee; Report of the Audit Committee; Duties and Responsibilities” in our 2025 Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all our directors, officers (including our principal executive officers, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controllers) and employees.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\n’\ns internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nChange in Accounting Principle and Stock Split Adjustments\nWe have audited the adjustments to the 2022 consolidated financial statement footnotes to retrospectively apply the effects from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n, as described in Note 1. Additionally, as described in Note 1, in 2023 the Company\n’\ns Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split distributed in the form of a stock dividend, and all references to number of shares and per share information in the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis. We have also audited the adjustments that were retrospectively applied to restate the number of shares and per share information reflected in the 2022 consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the adjustments for the change in accounting principle and stock split described above are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2022 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\n’\ns management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\n’\ns financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosure to which it relates.\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAccrued Promotional Allowances\nDescription of the Matter\n​\nThe Company recorded $267.7 million in accrued promotional allowances as of December 31, 2024. As described in Notes 1 and 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company\n’\ns promotional allowances are calculated based on various programs and agreements with its bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established at the time of the initial product sale. These accruals are based on agreed-upon terms as well as the Company\n’\ns historical experience with similar programs. Promotional allowances for the Company\n’\ns energy drink products primarily include consideration given to its non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers. The promotional expenditures are recorded as a reduction to net sales in the period the underlying sale occurs.\nAuditing the accrued promotional allowances was challenging due to the amount of data utilized to compute the accrual as a result of the number of bottlers/distributors and retail customers.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n​\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management\n’\ns controls over promotional allowances. We also tested controls over management\n’\ns review of the amount of the recorded promotional allowances and tested management\n’\ns controls to validate the completeness and accuracy of data used in management\n’\ns estimate.\nOur substantive audit procedures included, among others, testing the data underlying the promotional allowances and testing the completeness and accuracy of the accrued promotional allowances. We evaluated the completeness of the accrual by selecting accrued promotional allowances recorded, sending confirmation requests to the bottlers/distributors and retail customers and testing a sample of payments made subsequent to year end. We performed analytical procedures considering historical relationships between the promotional allowances recorded to sales. We additionally performed detail testing over the current year promotional expenditures and performed testing over management\n’\ns lookback analysis comparing the previous year-end accrued promotional allowances amounts to actual payments. Lastly, we performed inquiries of the Company\n’\ns sales and marketing personnel in order to corroborate our understanding of new and existing promotional programs that could impact the amounts recorded.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\n​\n​\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\n​\n​\n​\nIrvine, California\n​\nFebruary 28, 2025\n​\n​\n​\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n​\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nMonster Beverage Corporation\nCorona, California\n​\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited, before the effects of the adjustments to retrospectively apply the stock split and segment disclosures required by Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07)\n, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows of Monster Beverage Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”) (the 2022 financial statements before the effects of the retrospective adjustments discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements are not presented herein). In our opinion, the 2022 financial statements, before the effects of the adjustments to retrospectively apply the stock split and segment disclosures required by ASU 2023-07 discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, present fairly, in all material respects, the results of the Company’s operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the adjustments to retrospectively apply the stock split or retrospective adjustments to segment disclosures discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance about whether such retrospective adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. Those retrospective adjustments were audited by the successor auditor.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

Amounts)\n​\n1.\nORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization\n – Monster Beverage Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Delaware. The Company is a holding company and has no operating business except through its consolidated subsidiaries.\nNature of Operations\n – The Company develops, markets, sells and distributes energy drink beverages and concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names: Monster Energy®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Rehab Monster®, Monster Energy® Nitro, Java Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign Inferno® Thermogenic Fuel, Reign Storm®, Bang Energy®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Nalu®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®, BPM®, BU®, Samurai®, Live+®, Predator® and Fury®.\nThe Company also develops, markets, sells and distributes still and sparkling waters under the Monster Tour Water® brand name.\nThe Company also develops, markets, sells and distributes craft beers, flavored malt beverages (“FMBs”) and hard seltzers under a number of brands, including Jai Alai® IPA, Florida Man® IPA, Dale’s Pale Ale®, Wild Basin® Hard Seltzers, Dallas Blonde®, Deep Ellum\nTM\n IPA, Perrin Brewing Company® Black Ale, Hop Rising® Double IPA, Wasatch® Apricot Hefeweizen, The Beast\nTM\n, Nasty Beast® Hard Tea and a host of other brands. \nBasis of Presentation\n – The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nStock Split\n – On February 28, 2023, the Company announced a \ntwo\n-for-one stock split of the Company’s common stock which was effected in the form of a \n100\n% stock dividend. The common stock dividend was issued on March 27, 2023 (the “Stock Split”) and the Company’s common stock began trading at the split adjusted price on March 28, 2023. Accordingly, all per share amounts, average common stock outstanding, common stock outstanding, common stock repurchased and equity-based compensation disclosure presented in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect the Stock Split. Stockholders’ equity has been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, to give effect to the Stock Split for all periods presented by reclassifying the par value of the additional shares issued in connection with the Stock Split to common stock from additional paid-in capital.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n – The Company consolidates all entities that it controls by ownership of a majority voting interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nBusiness Combinations – \nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations”. FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination.\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n– The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future.\n82\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nInvestments\n – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. Under FASB ASC 326-30-35, a security is considered to be impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Where the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss, the Company will record an impairment relating to credit losses through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments has resulted from credit loss or other factors at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether an impairment has resulted from credit loss or other factors include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and the Company’s intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value.\nAccounts Receivable – \nThe Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45, in its consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis.\nInventories\n – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net realizable value).\nProperty and Equipment\n – Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, equipment, real property and vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (generally \nfive\n to \nthirty years\n) and is calculated using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income.\nGoodwill\n – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company will recognize an impairment for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2024, goodwill impairment charges of $\n86.3\n million were recorded related to the Alcohol Brands reporting unit. Subsequent to the impairment charges recorded, there is \nno\n remaining goodwill for the Alcohol Brands reporting unit. As of December 31, 2024, the accumulated goodwill impairment balance was $\n86.3\n million related entirely to the Alcohol Brands reporting unit. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 there were \nno\n goodwill impairments recorded and there are \nno\n accumulated impairment balances.\n83\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nOther Intangibles\n – Other Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, \n®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Unleash the Beast!®, Rehab Monster®, Java Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Monster Energy® Nitro, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign Inferno®, Reign Storm®, Predator®, Fury®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Nalu®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®, BPM®, BU®, Samurai®, Bang Energy®, Monster Tour Water®, Oskar Blues Brewery®, Cigar City®, Deep Ellum Brewing Co®, Perrin Brewing Company®, Squatters®, Wasatch®, Jai Alai®, Dale’s Pale Ale®, Dallas Blonde®, Wild Basin®, Dale’s®, Mama’s Little Yella Pils®, Hop Rising®, The Beast\nTM\n, The Beast Unleashed® and Nasty Beast® Hard Tea trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages.

In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. External legal costs incurred in the defense of the Company’s trademarks are capitalized when the future economic benefit of the intangible asset will be increased, and a successful defense is probable. In the event of a successful defense, the settlements received are netted against the external legal costs that were capitalized. The external legal costs incurred and settlements received may not occur in the same period. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, impairment charges of $\n40.8\n million, $\n38.7\n million and $\n2.2\n million, respectively, were recorded to indefinite-lived intangibles.\nThe Company presently has more than \n21,400\n registered trademarks and pending applications in various countries worldwide, and the Company applies for new trademarks on an ongoing basis. The Company regards its trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and other intellectual property as very important to its business. The Company considers Monster®, Monster Energy®, \n ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Unleash the Beast!®, Rehab Monster®, Java Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Monster Energy® Nitro, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign Inferno®, Reign Storm®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®, Predator®, Fury®, Live+®, BPM®, Samurai®, Bang Energy®, Monster Tour Water®, Oskar Blues Brewery®, Cigar City®, Deep Ellum Brewing Co®, Perrin Brewing Company®, Squatters®, Wasatch®, Jai Alai®, Dale’s Pale Ale®, Dallas Blonde®, Wild Basin®, Dale’s®, Hop Rising®, The Beast\nTM\n, The Beast Unleashed® and Nasty Beast® Hard Tea to be its core trademarks. The Company also owns the intellectual property of its most important flavors for certain of its Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in perpetuity.\nLeases –\n The Company leases identified assets comprised of real estate and equipment. Real estate leases consist primarily of office and warehouse space and equipment leases consist of vehicles and warehouse equipment. At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the term, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At inception of a lease, the Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component based on the component’s relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately.\nLeases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in FASB ASC 842, “Leases”. The Company’s operating leases are comprised of real estate and warehouse equipment, and the Company’s finance leases are comprised of vehicles. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at the commencement date. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term operating leases that have a term of 12 months or less. \nCertain of the Company’s real estate leases contain variable lease payments, including payments based on an index or rate. Variable lease payments based on an index or rate are initially measured using the index or rate in effect at the lease commencement date. Additional payments based on the change in an index or rate, or payments based on a change in the Company’s portion of real estate taxes and insurance, are recorded as a period expense when incurred. \n84\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nLease expense for operating leases, consisting of lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Interest expense on finance leases is calculated using the amortized cost basis and is included in interest and other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income.\nLong-Lived Assets \n– Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, impairment charges of $\n8.2\n million and $\n4.3\n million, respectively, were recognized on property and equipment related to the Company’s alcohol products. For the year ended December 31, 2022, there were \nno\n impairment indicators identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n – The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging risk exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and aluminum commodity prices. The Company’s derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Company values each derivative financial instrument by obtaining valuation information from a reliable and observable market source. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the derivative’s mark to fair value is initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings, unless it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to fair value with gains and losses immediately recorded in earnings. In the consolidated statements of cash flows, derivative activities are classified based on the cash flows of the items being hedged. Upon the dedesignation of an effective derivative contract, the gains or losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the originally hedged item affects earnings, unless it is probable the hedged item will not occur, at which time it is recognized immediately. Any gains or losses incurred after the dedesignation date are recorded in earnings immediately.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\n – The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2024 have terms of three months or less. The Company does not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.\nThe Company has not designated its foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in interest and other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, aggregate foreign currency transaction gains (losses), including the gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts, amounted to ($\n26.4\n) million, ($\n60.2\n) million and ($\n37.9\n) million, respectively, and have been recorded in interest and other income(expense), net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n85\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nRevenue Recognition\n – See Note 3.\nCost of Sales – \nCost of sales consists of the costs of flavors, concentrates, supplement ingredients and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of beverages, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. In addition, the Company includes in costs of sales certain costs such as depreciation, amortization and payroll costs that relate to the direct manufacture by the Company of certain flavors and concentrates. Raw materials account for the largest portion of cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials.\nOperating Expenses\n – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, impairment charges on goodwill and other intangible assets, depreciation and other general and administrative costs.\nFreight-Out Costs \n– For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, freight-out costs amounted to $\n224.2\n million, $\n223.6\n million and $\n249.2\n million, respectively, and have been recorded in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses \n– The Company accounts for advertising production costs by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. A significant amount of the Company’s promotional expenses result from payments under sponsorship and endorsement contracts. Accounting for sponsorship and endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, sponsorship and endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to the periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Advertising and promotional expenses, including, but not limited to, production costs amounted to $\n584.1\n million, $\n528.9\n million and $\n460.7\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Advertising and promotional expenses that are not subject to FASB ASC 606 are included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nIncome Taxes\n – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.\n86\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nStock-Based Compensation\n – The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC 718. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date at which the non-employee’s performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units and performance share units is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit or performance share unit in cash, the award is classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date. See Note 16.\nNet Income Per Common Share\n – In accordance with FASB ASC 260, net income per common share, on a basic and diluted basis, is presented for all periods. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding. The calculation of common equivalent shares assumes the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury share repurchases at average market prices, as applicable.\nConcentration of Risk – \nCertain of the Company’s products utilize components (raw materials and/or co-packing services) from a limited number of sources. A disruption in the supply of such components could significantly affect the Company’s revenues from those products, as alternative sources of such components may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or within a reasonably short time period. The Company continues to endeavor to secure the availability of alternative sources for such components and minimize the risk of any disruption in production.\nThe Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”), through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “TCCC Subsidiaries”), accounted for approximately \n3\n%, \n2\n% and \n2\n% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCoca-Cola Europacific Partners accounted for approximately \n14\n%, \n13\n% and \n13\n% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCoca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. accounted for approximately \n10\n%, \n10\n% and \n11\n% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nReyes Holdings, LLC accounted for approximately \n9\n% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nCredit Risk\n – The Company sells its products nationally and internationally, primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors (“bottlers/distributors”), retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses, and historically, such losses have been within management’s expectations.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n – The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments.\nUse of Estimates\n – The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n87\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements –\n In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n. The amendments in this update improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 on January 1, 2024, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. The amendments in this update primarily require more detailed disclosures related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.\n The amendments in this update require the Company to disaggregate key expense categories such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization within its financial statements. The amendments in ASU 2024-03 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2024-03 will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n2.\nACQUISITION \nOn July 31, 2023, a subsidiary of the Company, Blast Asset Acquisition LLC, completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Bang Energy”) (the “Bang Transaction”). The acquired assets primarily include the Bang Energy® drinks business and a beverage production facility in Phoenix, AZ. The Company accounted for the Bang Transaction in accordance with FASB ASC 805.\nIn accordance with Regulation S-X, pro forma unaudited condensed financial information for the Bang Transaction has not been provided as the impact of the transaction on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity was not material.\n​\n3.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenues are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The Company has \nfour\n operating and reportable segments: (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment (“Monster Energy® Drinks”), which is primarily comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Reign Storm® total wellness energy drinks and Bang Energy® drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment (“Strategic Brands”), which is primarily comprised of the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”) in 2015 as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands, Predator® and Fury®, (iii) Alcohol Brands segment (“Alcohol Brands”), which is comprised of various craft beers, FMBs and hard seltzers and (iv) Other segment (“Other”), which is comprised of certain products sold by American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to independent third-party customers (the “AFF Third-Party Products”).\nThe Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged drinks primarily to bottlers/distributors. In some cases, the Company sells ready-to-drink packaged drinks directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military.\nThe Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling “concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold by such bottlers to other bottlers/distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, foodservice customers, drug stores, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, the Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers/distributors.\n88\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nThe Company’s Alcohol Brands segment primarily generates operating revenues by selling kegged and ready-to-drink canned beers, FMBs and hard seltzers primarily to beer distributors in the United States.\nThe majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance obligation by transferring control of its products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when the Company’s products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying contracts or agreements. Certain of the Company’s bottlers/distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, control of the Company’s products passes to such bottlers/distributors when they notify the Company that they have taken possession or transferred the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. The Company’s general payment terms are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. The Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company excludes from revenues all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on the sale of its products and collected from customers.\nDistribution expenses to transport the Company’s products, where applicable, and warehousing expense after manufacture are accounted for within operating expenses.\nPromotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales for the Company’s energy drink products, primarily include consideration given to the Company’s non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following:\n●\ndiscounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; \n●\nreimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; \n●\nthe Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; \n●\nthe Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; \n●\nincentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; \n●\ndiscounted or free products; \n●\ncontractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and \n●\ncommissions to TCCC based on the Company’s sales to wholly-owned subsidiaries of TCCC (the “TCCC Subsidiaries”) and/or to TCCC bottlers/distributors accounted for under the equity method by TCCC (the “TCCC Related Parties”).\nThe Company’s promotional allowance programs with its non-alcohol bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, typically ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances for its energy drink products are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established at the time of initial product sale for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or bottler/distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value are summarized below.\n●\nLevel 1: \nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n●\nLevel 2: \nObservable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.\n●\nLevel 3: \nUnobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nASC 820 requires the use of observable market inputs (quoted market prices) when measuring fair value and requires a Level 1 quoted price to be used to measure fair value whenever possible.\nThe following tables present the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, segregated among the appropriate levels within the fair value hierarchy at:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n    \nLevel 1\n    \nLevel 2\n    \nLevel 3\n    \nTotal\nCash\n​\n$\n \n1,103,647\n​\n$\n \n—\n​\n$\n \n—\n​\n$\n \n1,103,647\nMoney market funds\n​\n \n \n396,306\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n396,306\nCertificates of deposit\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n33,334\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n33,334\nForeign currency derivatives\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n799\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n799\nCommodity derivatives\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n (\n785\n)\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n (\n785\n)\nTotal\n​\n$\n \n1,499,953\n​\n$\n \n33,348\n​\n$\n \n—\n​\n$\n \n1,533,301\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAmounts included in:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n Cash and cash equivalents\n​\n$\n \n1,499,953\n​\n$\n \n33,334\n​\n$\n \n—\n​\n$\n \n1,533,287\n Accounts receivable, net\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n5,991\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n5,991\n Other assets\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n6\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n6\n Accrued liabilities\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n (\n5,952\n)\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n (\n5,952\n)\n Other liabilities\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n (\n31\n)\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n (\n31\n)\nTotal\n​\n$\n \n1,499,953\n​\n$\n \n33,348\n​\n$\n \n—\n​\n$\n \n1,533,301\n​\n94\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2023\n    \nLevel 1\n    \nLevel 2\n    \nLevel 3\n    \nTotal\nCash\n​\n$\n \n1,105,701\n​\n$\n \n—\n​\n$\n \n—\n​\n$\n \n1,105,701\nMoney market funds\n​\n \n \n960,873\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n960,873\nCertificates of deposit\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n33,824\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n33,824\nCommercial paper\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n163,774\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n163,774\nCorporate bonds\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n264,208\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n264,208\nMunicipal securities\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n361\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n361\nU.S. government agency securities\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n159,585\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n159,585\nU.S. treasuries\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n641,385\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n641,385\nForeign currency derivatives\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n (\n1,083\n)\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n (\n1,083\n)\nCommodity derivatives\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n4,410\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n4,410\nTotal\n​\n$\n \n2,066,574\n​\n$\n \n1,266,464\n​\n$\n \n—\n​\n$\n \n3,333,038\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAmounts included in:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n Cash and cash equivalents\n​\n$\n \n2,066,574\n​\n$\n \n231,101\n​\n$\n \n—\n​\n$\n \n2,297,675\n Short-term investments\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n955,605\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n955,605\n Accounts receivable, net\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n4,618\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n4,618\n Other assets\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n316\n​\n​\n \n—\n​\n​\n \n316\n Investments\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n76,431\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n \n76,431\n Accrued liabilities\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n (\n1,607\n)\n​\n \n \n—\n​\n \n (\n1,607\n)\nTotal\n​\n$\n \n2,066,574\n​\n$\n \n1,266,464\n​\n$\n \n—\n​\n$\n \n3,333,038\n​\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company held \nno\n short-term or long-term investments. At December 31, 2023, all of the Company’s short-term and long-term investments were classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s valuation of its Level 1 investments is based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical securities. The Company’s valuation of its Level 2 investments is based on other observable inputs, specifically a market approach which utilizes valuation models, pricing systems, mathematical tools and other relevant information for the same or similar securities. The Company’s valuation of its Level 2 foreign currency exchange contracts is based on quoted market prices of the same or similar instruments, adjusted for counterparty risk. There were \nno\n transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and there were no changes in the Company’s valuation techniques.\nAssets recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. These assets are measured at fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The fair value of trademarks was determined using the relief-from-royalty method. The fair value of reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach. Determining the fair value of trademarks and reporting units required the use of significant judgment, including royalty rates, discount rates, assumptions in the Company’s long-term business plan about future revenue and expenses, capital expenditures, and changes in working capital, which are dependent on internal forecasts and estimation of the long-term growth rate. These plans take into consideration factors including historical experience, anticipated future economic conditions, and expectations for the industry and markets in which the Company participates. Inputs used to estimate these fair values included significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, the fair value assessments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in the fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is currently less than two years.\n​\nThe Company has entered into commodity hedge contracts to mitigate the price risk associated with a portion of its forecasted aluminum purchases. These derivative instruments were designated as part of the Company’s commodity cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of aluminum. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for this program were $\n127.0\n million and $\n98.3\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n96\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nThe following table presents the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nYear ended December 31, 2024\nDerivatives designated as\n    \nGain (loss)\n    \nLocation of gain (loss)\n    \nGain (loss) reclassified\nhedging instruments\n \nrecognized in AOCI\n \nrecognized in income\n \nfrom AOCI into income\nCommodity contracts\n​\n$\n (\n1,131\n)\n \nCost of sales\n​\n$\n \n2,835\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nDerivatives designated as \n    \nGain (loss) \n    \nLocation of gain (loss)\n    \nGain (loss) reclassified\nhedging instruments\n​\nrecognized in AOCI\n​\n recognized in income\n​\n from AOCI into income\nCommodity contracts\n​\n$\n4,410\n \n​\nCost of sales\n​\n$\n(\n317\n)\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings net gains (losses) of $\n0.9\n million from the amount recorded in AOCI as the anticipated cash flows occur during the next 12 months.\n​\nEconomic (Non-Designated) Hedging Strategy\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks related primarily to its foreign business operations. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts of the Company that were outstanding as of December 31, 2024 have terms of \napproximately \none month\n or less\n. The Company does not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. \nThe Company has not designated its foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions. Therefore, gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in interest and other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic hedges were $\n342.4\n million and $\n282.7\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe net gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in the consolidated statements of income were as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGain (loss) recognized\n​\n​\n​\n​\nin income on derivatives\n​\n​\n​\n​\nYear ended\nDerivatives not designated as\n​\nLocation of gain (loss)\n​\nDecember 31, \n​\nDecember 31, \n​\nDecember 31, \nhedging instruments\n    \nrecognized in income on derivatives\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nForeign currency exchange contracts\n \nInterest and other income (expense), net\n \n$\n \n1,651\n \n$\n (\n12,364\n)\n \n$\n (\n6,893\n)\n​\nCertain of the Company’s counterparty agreements contain provisions that require the Company to post collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position.

As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded impairment charges of \n$\n86.3\n million related to goodwill of the Alcohol Brands reporting unit. Subsequent to the impairment charges recorded, there is \nno\n remaining goodwill for the Alcohol Brands reporting unit. As of December 31, 2024, the accumulated goodwill impairment balance was \n$\n86.3\n million related entirely to the Alcohol Brands reporting unit. Further, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nimpairment charges\n of \n$\n40.8\n million and \n$\n38.7\n million were recorded to other indefinite lived intangible assets related primarily to the Alcohol Brands segment.

Revenue recognized was \n$\n21.5\n million, \n$\n21.5\n million and \n$\n21.4\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n​\n12.\nDEBT\nThe Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31,\n​\nDecember 31,\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\nTerm loan\n​\n$\n \n375,000\n​\n$\n —\nRevolving credit facility\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n —\nTotal debt\n​\n \n \n375,000\n​\n \n —\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs\n​\n \n (\n1,049\n)\n​\n \n —\nTotal debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs\n​\n \n \n373,951\n​\n \n —\nLess: current portion of long-term debt\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n —\nLong-term debt\n​\n$\n \n373,951\n​\n$\n —\n​\nIn May 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other lenders, which provides for senior unsecured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $\n1.50\n billion (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”). The Credit Facilities consist of a $\n750.0\n million term loan (the “Term Loan”) and up to $\n750.0\n million in multicurrency revolving loan commitments (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Term Loan matures May 2027 and the Revolving Credit Facility matures May 2029. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal to the applicable rate plus margin (as defined in the Credit Facilities). The interest rate in effect on the Term Loan was \n5.42\n% as of December 31, 2024. \nNo\n borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024. \n100\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities are due on the respective maturity date. Borrowings may be repaid at any time during the term of the Credit Facilities and, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, may be reborrowed prior to the maturity date.\nAdditionally, the Company has a line of credit of up to $\n15.0\n million with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch. At December 31, 2024, the interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit was \n5.5\n%. As of December 31, 2024, \nno\n amount was outstanding on this line of credit.\nBased on Level 2 inputs, the carrying value of the Company’s debt approximates fair value, as borrowings are subject to variable interest rates that adjust with changes in market rates and market conditions and the current interest rate approximates that which would be available under similar financial arrangements.\n​\n13.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nContractual Obligations\n – The Company had the following contractual obligations related primarily to sponsorships and other marketing activities as of December 31, 2024:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nYear Ending December 31:\n    \n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n2025\n​\n$\n \n258,010\n2026\n​\n​\n \n94,471\n2027\n​\n​\n \n44,256\n2028\n​\n​\n \n39,732\n2029\n​\n​\n \n38,247\n2030 and thereafter\n​\n​\n \n95\n​\n \n$\n \n474,811\n​\nPurchase Commitments\n – The Company had purchase commitments aggregating approximately \n$\n415.9\n million at December 31, 2024, which represented commitments made by the Company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers of raw materials for the production of its products. These obligations vary in terms but are generally satisfied within \none year\n.\nThe Company purchases various raw material items, including, but not limited to, flavors, ingredients, supplement ingredients, containers, milk, glucose, sucralose and cream, from a limited number of suppliers. An interruption in supply from any of such resources could result in the Company’s inability to produce certain products for limited or possibly extended periods of time. The aggregate value of purchases from suppliers of such limited resources described above for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n577.0\n million, $\n590.5\n million and $\n666.1\n million, respectively. \nGuarantees\n – The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third-party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) certain agreements with the Company’s officers, directors and employees under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship, (ii) certain distribution or purchase agreements under which the Company may have to indemnify the Company’s customers from any claim, liability or loss arising out of any actual or alleged injury or damages suffered in connection with the consumption or purchase of the Company’s products or the use of Company trademarks, and (iii) certain real estate leases, under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for liabilities and other claims arising from the Company’s use of the applicable premises. The terms of such obligations vary and typically, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Generally, the Company believes that its insurance coverage is adequate to cover any resulting liabilities or claims.\nLitigation \n– \nFrom time to time in the normal course of business, the Company is named in litigation, including labor and employment matters, personal injury matters, consumer class actions, intellectual property matters, data privacy matters, and claims, including from prior distributors. Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known \n101\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nto the Company, management believes that such litigation in aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nThe Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that is accrued, if any, and any related insurance reimbursements. As of December 31, 2024, $\n16.8\n million of loss contingencies were included in the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, $\n0.3\n million of loss contingencies were included in the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n​\n14.\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, after tax, are as follows at December 31:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\nAccumulated net unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities\n \n$\n —\n \n$\n (\n758\n)\nAccumulated foreign currency translation gain (loss)\n​\n​\n (\n269,930\n)\n​\n​\n (\n128,989\n)\nAccumulated net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\n​\n​\n \n443\n​\n​\n \n4,410\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive loss\n \n$\n (\n269,487\n)\n \n$\n (\n125,337\n)\n​\n​\n15.\nTREASURY STOCK \nShare Repurchase Programs\nOn November 2, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $\n500.0\n million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the “November 2022 Repurchase Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company purchased approximately \n4.6\n million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $\n51.67\n per share, for a total amount of approximately $\n239.6\n million, which exhausted the availability under the November 2022 Repurchase Plan.\nOn November 7, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to an additional $\n500.0\n million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the “November 2023 Repurchase Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company purchased approximately \n10.6\n million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $\n47.16\n per share, for a total amount of approximately $\n500.0\n million, which exhausted the availability under the November 2023 Repurchase Plan.\nOn August 19, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to an additional $\n500.0\n million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the “August 2024 Repurchase Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2024, \nno\n shares were repurchased under the August 2024 Repurchase Plan. As of February 27, 2025, $\n500.0\n million remained available for repurchase under the August 2024 Repurchase Plan.\nThe aggregate amount of the Company’s outstanding common stock that remains available for repurchase under all previously authorized repurchase plans is $\n500.0\n million as of February 27, 2025.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, \n0.4\n million shares of common stock were purchased from employees in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding taxes due for a total amount of $\n23.1\n million. While such purchases are considered common stock repurchases, they are not counted as purchases against the Company’s authorized share repurchase programs. Such shares are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.\nTender Offer\nOn May 1, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to execute a modified “Dutch auction” tender offer to repurchase up to $\n3.0\n billion of its outstanding shares of common stock. On May 8, 2024, the Company commenced the tender offer, with such offer expiring on June 5, 2024. On June 10, 2024, the Company accepted for purchase a total of approximately \n56.6\n million \n102\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nshares of common stock at a purchase price of $\n53.00\n per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $\n3.0\n billion. The repurchase was funded with approximately $\n2.25\n billion of cash on hand and approximately $\n750\n million in borrowings. The cost of these shares and the fees relating to the tender offer are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.\n16.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company has \ntwo\n stock-based compensation plans under which shares were available for grant as of December 31, 2024: (i) the Monster Beverage Corporation 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan”), which includes the Monster Beverage Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan as a sub plan thereunder, and (ii) the Monster Beverage Corporation 2017 Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors as Amended and Restated on February 23, 2022 (the “2017 Directors Plan”), which includes the Monster Beverage Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors as a sub plan thereunder. The 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on April 14, 2020 and approved by the stockholders of the Company at the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders held on June 3, 2020 (the “Effective Date”). The 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan replaced the Monster Beverage Corporation 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan”).\nThe 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other share-based awards up to an aggregate of \n92,338,734\n shares of the Company’s common stock, comprised of \n64,000,000\n new shares of common stock reserved under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which were authorized on the Effective Date, and \n28,338,734\n shares of common stock that were available for grant under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2019 and prior to the Effective Date. Shares authorized under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan are reduced by \none\n (1) share for options or stock appreciation rights granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan and for any grants after December 31, 2019 under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan, and by \n2.6\n shares for each share granted or issued with respect to a Full Value Award under either the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan or for any shares granted after December 31, 2019 under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan. A “Full Value Award” is an award other than an incentive stock option, a non-qualified stock option, or a stock appreciation right, which is settled by the issuance of shares. Options granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan may be incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”), or non-qualified stock options.\nShares previously granted under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan after December 31, 2019 and prior to the Effective Date of the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan reduced the number of shares available for grant under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2024, \n21,077,180\n shares of the Company’s common stock have been granted, net of cancellations, and \n66,497,789\n shares (as adjusted for Full Value Awards) of the Company’s common stock remain available for grant under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan.\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) has sole and exclusive authority to grant stock awards to all employees who are not new hires and to all new hires who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (“Section 16”). Each of the Compensation Committee and the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Executive Committee”) independently has the authority to grant stock awards to (i) new hires and (ii) employees receiving a promotion, in each case, who are not Section 16 employees. Awards granted by the Executive Committee are not subject to approval or ratification by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. Options granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest over a \nthree\n- to \nfive-year\n period from the grant date and are generally exercisable up to \n10 years\n after the grant date. Restricted stock units granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest over a \nthree\n- or \nfive-year\n period from the grant date. Performance share units will generally vest based on an award recipient’s continuous employment through a cumulative \nthree\n - year performance period and the achievement of financial performance goals specified for the applicable award during such performance period.\nIn 2016, the Company adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan (as a sub plan to the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan), pursuant to which eligible employees may elect to defer cash and/or equity based compensation and to receive the deferred amounts, together with an investment return (positive or negative), either at a pre-determined time in the future or upon termination of employment with the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates that are participating employers under the Deferred Compensation Plan, as provided under the Deferred Compensation Plan and in relevant deferral elections. Deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan are unfunded and \n103\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nunsecured. As of December 31, 2024 deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan are solely comprised of cash compensation and equity compensation and are not material in the aggregate.\nIn 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Directors Plan, a successor plan to the 2009 Monster Beverage Corporation Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2017 Directors Plan permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares or restricted stock units, deferred awards, dividend equivalents, and other share based awards up to an aggregate of \n2,500,000\n shares of common stock of the Company to non-employee directors of the Company. \nEach calendar year, a non-employee director will receive an annual retainer and annual equity award, as provided for in the 2017 Directors Plan, which may be modified from time to time. In February 2022, the Board of Directors amended and restated the 2017 Directors Plan to provide for increases to the annual cash retainer and annual equity retainer that non-employee directors are entitled to receive. Currently, non-employee directors receive an annual equity retainer of approximately $\n175,000\n in the form of restricted stock units at each annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders or promptly thereafter. A non-employee director’s annual award of restricted stock units will generally vest on the earliest to occur of: (a) the last business day immediately preceding the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders in the calendar year following the calendar year in which the grant date occurs, (b) a Change of Control (as defined in the 2017 Directors Plan), (c) the non-employee director’s death, or (d) the date of the non-employee director’s separation from service due to disability, so long as the non-employee director remains a non-employee director through such date. The Board of Directors may in its discretion award non-employee directors stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other share-based awards in lieu of or in addition to restricted stock units. The Board of Directors may amend or terminate the 2017 Directors Plan at any time, subject to certain limitations set forth in the 2017 Directors Plan. As of December 31, 2024, \n291,791\n shares of the Company’s common stock had been granted under the 2017 Directors Plan, and \n2,208,209\n shares of the Company’s common stock remain available for grant.\nIn 2017, the Company adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (as a sub plan to the 2017 Directors Plan), pursuant to which the Board of Directors may permit non-employee directors to elect, at such times and in accordance with rules and procedures (or sub-plan) adopted by the Board of Directors (which are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, as applicable), to receive all or any portion of such non-employee director’s compensation, whether payable in cash or in equity, on a deferred basis. Deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors are unfunded and unsecured. As of December 31, 2024, deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors are solely comprised of cash compensation and equity compensation and are not material in the aggregate. The 2017 Directors Plan was adopted to effectuate any such deferrals. The 2017 Directors Plan is administered by the Board of Directors. Each award granted under the 2017 Directors Plan will be evidenced by a written agreement and will contain the terms and conditions that the Board of Directors deems appropriate.\nIn February 2022, as part of the Board of Directors’ amendment and restatement of the 2017 Directors Plan, such amendment and restatement also introduced the requirement for each non-employee director to satisfy the share ownership guidelines set forth below, as may be modified by the Board of Directors from time to time. The current share ownership guidelines provide that non-employee directors of the Company must:\n●\nHold shares of Company common stock having a total value of five times the annual retainer payable to a non-employee director (excluding any portion of the annual retainer attributable to a non-employee director’s service as a member of a subcommittee, as a chair of a subcommittee or as the lead independent director, as applicable). For this purpose, deferred shares or deferred restricted stock units will be deemed held, to the extent vested.\n●\nThe minimum stock ownership level must be achieved by each non-employee director by the fifth anniversary of such non-employee director’s initial appointment to the Board of Directors.\n●\nOnce achieved, ownership of the guideline amount should be maintained for so long as the non-employee director retains his or her seat on the Board of Directors.\n●\nThere may be rare instances where these guidelines would place a hardship on a non-employee director. In these cases or in similar circumstances, the Board of Directors will make the final decision as to developing an alternative stock ownership guideline for a non-employee director that reflects the intention of these guidelines and his or her personal circumstances.\n104\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nThe Company recorded $\n91.0\n million, $\n68.8\n million and $\n64.1\n million of compensation expense relating to outstanding options, restricted stock units, performance share units and other share-based awards during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe tax benefit for tax deductions from non-qualified stock option exercises, disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and performance share units for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n12.9\n million, $\n62.2\n million and $\n9.1\n million, respectively. \nStock Options\nUnder the Company’s stock-based compensation plans, all stock options granted through December 31, 2024 were granted at prices based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company records compensation expense for (i) employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant and (ii) for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date at which the non-employee’s performance is complete, in each case using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company uses historical data to determine the exercise behavior, volatility and forfeiture rate of the options.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options granted during:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\n \nDividend yield\n​\n \n0.0\n%  \n \n0.0\n%  \n \n0.0\n%  \nExpected volatility\n​\n \n27.4\n%  \n \n27.6\n%  \n \n27.7\n%  \nRisk-free interest rate\n​\n \n4.18\n%  \n \n3.75\n%  \n \n2.15\n%  \nExpected term\n​\n6.4\n Years\n​\n6.3\n Years\n​\n6.1\n Years\n​\n​\nExpected Volatility\n: The Company uses historical volatility as it provides a reasonable estimate of the expected volatility. Historical volatility is based on the most recent volatility of the stock price over a period of time equivalent to the expected term of the option.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate\n: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option.\nExpected Term\n: The Company’s expected term represents the weighted-average period that the Company’s stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on the expected time to post-vesting exercise of options by employees. The Company uses historical exercise patterns of previously granted options to derive employee behavioral patterns used to forecast expected exercise patterns.\n105\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s activities with respect to its stock option plans as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nWeighted-\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nWeighted-\n​\nAverage\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAverage\n​\nRemaining\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNumber of\n​\nExercise\n​\nContractual\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nShares (in\n​\nPrice Per\n​\nTerm (in\n​\n Aggregate\nOptions\n    \nthousands)\n    \nShare\n    \n years)\n    \nIntrinsic Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024\n \n \n24,983\n​\n$\n \n33.64\n \n 5.8\n​\n$\n \n598,866\nGranted 01/01/24 - 03/31/24\n \n \n4,332\n​\n$\n \n60.29\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGranted 04/01/24 - 06/30/24\n \n \n62\n​\n$\n \n51.89\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGranted 07/01/24 - 09/30/24\n \n \n1,236\n​\n$\n \n48.40\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGranted 10/01/24 - 12/31/24\n \n \n12\n​\n$\n \n51.59\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nExercised\n \n (\n2,908\n)\n​\n$\n \n27.16\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCancelled or forfeited\n \n (\n629\n)\n​\n$\n \n48.28\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n \n \n27,088\n​\n$\n \n38.98\n \n 5.8\n​\n$\n \n400,207\nVested and expected to vest in the future at December 31, 2024\n​\n \n26,124\n​\n$\n \n38.49\n​\n 5.7\n​\n$\n \n396,642\nExercisable at December 31, 2024\n \n \n14,169\n​\n$\n \n29.39\n \n 3.7\n​\n$\n \n328,318\n​\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2024:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOptions Outstanding\n​\nOptions Exercisable\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nWeighted \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAverage \n​\n Weighted \n​\nNumber\n​\nWeighted\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNumber\n​\nRemaining \n​\nAverage\n​\nExercisable \n​\nAverage\nRange of Exercise\n​\nOutstanding\n​\n Contractual \n​\nExercise\n​\n(in\n​\nExercise\nPrices ($)\n     \n(in thousands) \n    \nTerm (Years)\n    \nPrice ($)\n    \nthousands)\n    \nPrice ($)\n$\n \n18.03\n-\n$\n \n22.46\n \n \n3,036\n \n 1.3\n \n$\n \n22.02\n \n \n3,036\n \n$\n \n22.02\n$\n \n22.51\n-\n$\n \n29.37\n \n \n5,108\n \n 2.8\n \n$\n \n26.63\n \n \n5,108\n \n$\n \n26.63\n$\n \n29.84\n-\n$\n \n31.20\n \n \n3,715\n \n 4.6\n \n$\n \n30.42\n \n \n3,400\n \n$\n \n30.35\n$\n \n31.46\n-\n$\n \n33.71\n \n \n53\n \n 4.6\n \n$\n \n32.49\n \n \n42\n \n$\n \n32.37\n$\n \n36.62\n-\n$\n \n36.62\n \n \n3,978\n \n 7.2\n \n$\n \n36.62\n \n \n1,088\n \n$\n \n36.62\n$\n \n38.96\n-\n$\n \n48.30\n \n \n3,191\n \n 7.6\n \n$\n \n45.75\n \n \n1,049\n \n$\n \n44.36\n$\n \n48.90\n-\n$\n \n48.90\n \n \n20\n \n 6.7\n \n$\n \n48.90\n \n \n9\n \n$\n \n48.90\n$\n \n50.82\n-\n$\n \n50.82\n \n \n3,641\n \n 8.2\n \n$\n \n50.82\n \n \n430\n \n$\n \n50.82\n$\n \n51.38\n-\n$\n \n59.36\n \n \n207\n \n 9.1\n \n$\n \n53.81\n \n \n7\n \n$\n \n55.56\n$\n \n60.30\n-\n$\n \n60.30\n \n \n4,139\n \n 9.2\n \n$\n \n60.30\n \n —\n \n$\n —\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n \n27,088\n \n 5.8\n \n$\n \n38.98\n \n \n14,169\n \n$\n \n29.39\n​\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n21.40\n per share, $\n18.28\n per share and $\n11.74\n per share, respectively.

If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, it would not have a significant impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.\nIt is expected that any change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit change within the next 12 months will not be significant. \nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as to income tax in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. \nThe Company is in various stages of examination with certain states and certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s 2021 through 2024 U.S. federal income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS. The Company’s state income tax returns are subject to examination for the 2020 through 2024 tax years.

Participating employees may contribute into a traditional plan with pretax salary or into a Roth plan with after tax salary up to statutory limits. The Company contributes \n50\n%\n of the employee contribution, up to \n8\n%\n of each employee’s earnings, which vest over \nfour years\n (2 years of service = \n50\n%\n, 3 years of service = \n75\n%\n, 4 years of service = \n100\n%\n). Matching contributions were \n$\n10.4\n million, \n$\n8.5\n million and \n$\n6.9\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n​\n20.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company has \nfour\n operating and reportable segments: (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which is primarily comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Reign Storm® total wellness energy drinks and Bang Energy® drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment, which is primarily comprised of the various energy drink brands acquired from TCCC in 2015 as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands, Predator® and Fury®, (iii) Alcohol Brands segment, which is comprised of various craft beers, FMBs and hard seltzers and (iv) Other segment, which is comprised of the AFF Third-Party Products.\nThe Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged drinks primarily to bottlers/distributors. In some cases, the Company sells ready-to-drink packaged drinks directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military.\nThe Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling “concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold by such bottlers to other bottlers/distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, foodservice customers, drug stores, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, the Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers/distributors.\nGenerally, the Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates higher per case net operating revenues, but lower per case gross profit margin percentages than the Strategic Brands segment.\nThe Company’s Alcohol Brands segment primarily generates operating revenues by selling kegged and ready-to-drink canned beers, FMBs and hard seltzers primarily to beer distributors in the United States.\nGenerally, the Alcohol Brands segment has lower gross profit margin percentages than the Monster Energy® Drinks segment.\nCorporate and unallocated amounts that do not relate to a reportable segment have been allocated to “Corporate & Unallocated.” No asset information, other than goodwill and other intangible assets, has been provided in the Company’s reportable segments, as management does not measure or allocate such assets on a segment basis.\nThe Company’s chief operating decision makers are the co-chief executive officers (the “Executive Committee”). The Executive Committee assesses segments’ performance by using each segments’ operating income and considers budget-to-actual variances on a periodic basis (at least quarterly) when making decisions about operational planning, including whether to invest resources into the segments or into other parts of the Company. Further, the Executive Committee uses segments’ operating income when comparing the results of each segment with one another.\n112\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n​\nThe tables below provide information about the Company’s reportable segments, including the corporate and unallocated category.\n​\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nMonster\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCorporate\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEnergy®\n​\nStrategic\n​\nAlcohol\n​\n​\n​\n​\nand\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDrinks\n    \nBrands\n    \nBrands\n    \nOther\n    \nUnallocated\n    \nConsolidated\nNet sales\n1\n​\n$\n \n6,864,597\n​\n$\n \n432,233\n​\n$\n \n172,313\n​\n$\n \n23,566\n​\n$\n —\n​\n$\n \n7,492,709\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCost of sales\n \n​\n \n3,170,993\n \n​\n \n125,099\n \n​\n \n131,590\n \n​\n \n16,149\n \n​\n —\n \n​\n  \nGross profit\n \n​\n \n3,693,604\n \n​\n \n307,134\n \n​\n \n40,723\n \n​\n \n7,417\n \n​\n —\n \n​\n \n4,048,878\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDistribution expense\n \n​\n \n322,464\n \n​\n \n6,030\n \n​\n \n13,621\n \n​\n \n19\n \n​\n —\n \n​\n  \nSelling and marketing expense\n \n​\n \n672,582\n \n​\n \n55,629\n \n​\n \n27,652\n \n​\n \n235\n \n​\n —\n \n​\n  \nNonmanufacturing payroll expense\n \n​\n \n164,091\n \n​\n \n8,790\n \n​\n \n36,884\n \n​\n \n2,174\n \n​\n \n377,382\n \n​\n  \nGoodwill and intangibles impairment\n \n​\n —\n \n​\n —\n \n​\n \n127,098\n \n​\n —\n \n​\n —\n \n​\n  \nOther segment items\n2\n \n​\n \n72,011\n \n​\n \n2,933\n \n​\n \n35,784\n \n​\n \n342\n \n​\n \n192,863\n \n​\n  \nOperating income (loss)\n1\n \n​\n \n2,462,456\n \n​\n \n233,752\n \n​\n (\n200,316\n)\n \n​\n \n4,647\n \n​\n (\n570,245\n)\n \n​\n \n1,930,294\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nInterest and other income (expense), net\n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n \n59,165\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n​\n$\n \n1,989,459\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDepreciation and amortization\n​\n$\n \n53,117\n​\n$\n \n942\n​\n$\n \n14,290\n​\n$\n \n200\n​\n$\n \n11,885\n​\n$\n \n80,434\n​\n1\nFor the Monster Energy® Drinks segment, includes \n$\n39.9\n million related to the recognition of deferred revenue.\n2\nOther segment items for each reportable segment include:\nMonster Energy® Drinks -
