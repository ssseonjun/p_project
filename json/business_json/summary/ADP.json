  "item1_summary": " The risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses . Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence . Failure to comply with, compliance with or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition or reputation .\n Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions and services could cause us to incur substantial costs . Changes in laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of laws by a regulatory authority, may decrease our revenues and earnings . Changes to U.S. or foreign tax laws, regulations or rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income .\n Changes in laws, or interpretations thereof, that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our PEO business . The risk of failing to receive such payments from PEO clients could be magnified during significant financial or other disruptions or catastrophic events .\n Our payroll and tax processing services involve the collection and disbursement of a significant amount of funds to federal, state and local tax authorities . Failure to properly or timely remit taxes on behalf of our clients could result in fines, penalties and interest for which we could be responsible, and could materially adversely affect our reputation, results of operations or financial condition .\n ADP Canada Co. is a registered entity with FINTRAC as a Money Service Business . We are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control . We have implemented policies and procedurations to implement policies and procedures .\n Any violations of anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities . Bank regulators continue to impose additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their BSA obligations . Banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses and third-party senders to be higher risk customers for money laundering .\n The collection, storage, hosting, transfer, processing, disclosure, use, security and retention and destruction of personal information is subject to privacy, data protection and cyber security laws . The European Union (the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and state consumer privacy laws like the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the \"CPRA\") are among the most comprehensive of these laws .\n We are increasingly leveraging AI and ML in our solutions and service delivery and are exploring how best to integrate generative AI technologies . Legislation that governs the development and/or use of AI has been adopted or is under consideration in the U.S. at the state and local level, as well as abroad . As a result, the ability to provide data-driven insights and otherwise leverage AI may be constrained by current or future laws .\n Our use of generative AI in our products and operations also introduces additional risks, including risks related to accuracy, bias, transparency, security, and privacy . Noncompliance with privacy, data protection, AI and cyber security laws and requirements could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses. Noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability and damage our reputation.\n Our ability to compete and our success depend, in part, upon our intellectual property . We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, clients, vendors, partners and others . Our intellectual property (including source code) could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyber-attack or other wrongful conduct .\n As we expand our use of AI, there is uncertainty regarding intellectual property ownership and license rights of AI algorithms and content generated by AI . We may be found to be infringing upon third party intellectual property rights . Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments .\n We collect significant amounts of funds from accounts of our clients and transmit them to their employees, tax authorities and other payees . We devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes . However, the global environment continues to grow increasingly hostile as attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication (including due to the use of AI)\n The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently . New computing technologies, including quantum computing, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we or our authorized third parties use or have used to encrypt and protect data . We may fail to anticipate or detect these techniques and/or incidents for long periods of time .\n As these threats continue to evolve and increase (including due to the use of AI), we continue to invest significant resources, and may be required to . invest significant additional resources, to modify and enhance our cybersecurity controls . As we become increasingly interconnected with our authorized third parties, the security risk of our networks and the larger ecosystem in which we operate is heightened .\n ADP has been the subject of cybersecurity attacks, including unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, corruption of data, and theft of sensitive information . As the global environment continues to grow increasingly hostile, the security of our operating environment is ever more important to our clients and p.P. be more susceptible to cybersecurity incidents .\n Our systems, applications, solutions and services may be subject to disruptions that could have a negative effect on our reputation . We need to properly manage these systems, and any upgrades, enhancements and expansions from time to time, in order to ensure they properly support them .

We have a global business resiliency program that includes disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures .\n Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, including as a result of AI, and if we fail to upgrade, enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish .

We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in product development and new technologies . We must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our development efforts before knowing to what extent our investments will result in products the market will accept .\n The extent of any such impact depends on developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and scope of the event; the governmental and business actions taken in response thereto . The impact on economic activity and employment levels; the effect on our clients, prospects, suppliers and partners; our ability to sell and provide our solutions and services, including due to travel restrictions, business and facility closures, and employee remote working arrangements .\n We invest our funds held for clients in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents . Such investments are subject to general market, interest rate, credit and liquidity risks . Clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on HCM services or renegotiating contracts with us, which may adversely affect our business and financial results .\n A sale of available-for-sale securities may result in the recognition of losses and reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients . Such risk could be magnified during significant financial or other disruptions or catastrophic events, such as the failure of a bank with whom a significant number of clients may bank at the time or more widespread stress or failure within the U.S. banking system .\n The investment community, clients, regulators, and other stakeholders may have evolving and varied expectations regarding our business, culture, and values .

The nature of the office environment and remote or hybrid working is changing . It may also present operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business . We have an enterprise-wide approach to security with the objectives of protecting client data and funds .\n ADP has implemented a cybersecurity program designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats . Unauthorized parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure, retain and dispose of, and the client funds that we collect and transmit .\n We have established a global, integrated business resiliency program designed to manage the impacts of technological, environmental, process and health risks on service delivery . We test our plans and processes through simulation exercises, scenario planning and tabletop exercises, using findings to improve processes . We maintain affiliations with cybercrime task forces and other third-party monitoring organizations to proactively identify malicious activity .\n ADP has been subject of cybersecurity attacks, including unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, and denial of service .
