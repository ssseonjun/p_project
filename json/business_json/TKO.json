    "item1": "Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”\n\n\nSegments\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we operated our business under two reportable segments, UFC and WWE. In addition, we also report results for the “Corporate” group, which incurs expenses that are not allocated to the business segments.\n\n\nUFC\n\n\nThe UFC segment reflects the business operations of UFC. Revenue from our UFC segment principally consists of media rights fees associated with the distribution of its programming content; ticket sales and site fees associated with the business’s global live events; sponsorship; and consumer products licensing agreements of UFC-branded products.\n\n\nWWE\n\n\nThe WWE segment reflects the business operations of WWE. Revenue from our WWE segment principally consists of media rights fees associated with the distribution of its programming content; ticket sales and site fees associated with the business’s global live events; sponsorship; and consumer products licensing agreements of WWE-branded products.\n\n\nCorporate\n\n\nCorporate reflects operations not allocated to the UFC or WWE segments and primarily consists of general and administrative expenses. These expenses relate largely to corporate activities, including information technology, facilities, legal, human resources, finance, accounting, treasury, investor relations, corporate communications, community relations and compensation to TKO’s management and board of directors, which support both reportable segments. Corporate expenses also include service fees paid by the Company to Endeavor under the Services Agreement, inclusive of fees paid for revenue producing services related to the segments.\n\n\n \n49\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nComponents of Our Operating Results\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nTKO primarily generates revenue via domestic and international media rights fees, ticket sales and site fees at our live events, sponsorships, and consumer products licensing.\n\n\nDirect Operating Costs\n\n\nTKO’s direct operating costs primarily include costs associated with our athletes and talent, production, marketing, venue costs related to live events, and commissions and direct costs with distributors, as well as certain service fees paid to Endeavor.\n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\n\nTKO’s selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs as well as rent, travel, professional service costs and certain service fees paid to Endeavor.\n\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n\nTKO Group Holdings, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in March 2023. As the sole managing member of TKO OpCo, TKO Group Holdings, Inc. ultimately controls the business and affairs of UFC and WWE. TKO Group Holdings, Inc. is subject to corporate income taxes on its share of taxable income of TKO OpCo.

This increase was primarily driven by $55.1 million of higher sponsorship from new sponsors and increases in fees from renewals, as well as $52.5 million of greater live event revenue driven by higher attendance and higher site fee revenues primarily from UFC 302 in Newark, New Jersey, UFC 307 in Salt Lake City, Utah and Fight Night events in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi as compared to the prior year. The \n\n\n \n50\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\ncurrent year also includes $8.8 million of increased media rights and content from higher domestic and international rights fees resulting from increases in contractual revenues despite having one fewer Fight Night event. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.4 million in consumer products licensing revenue from lower royalties on UFC-branded products.\n \n\n\n•\nWWE contributed revenue of $1,398.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $382.8 million for the period from September 12, 2023 through December 31, 2023 following its acquisition. This incremental revenue was driven by $616.0 million of media rights and content primarily associated with domestic and international rights fees for WWE’s flagship programs, \nRaw\n, \nSmackDown\n and \nNXT\n, and premium live event programming, including \nWrestleMania XL \nevents, as well as $250.8 million of live event revenue which was primarily driven by hosting additional events with live ticketed audiences, including \nWrestleMania XL \nevents, as well as site fees associated with certain international premium live events compared to the prior year. The additional revenue was also due to $83.5 million of consumer products licensing related to the sale of WWE-branded products and $65.0 million of sponsorship revenue from the sale of advertising.\n\n\nDirect Operating Costs\n\n\nDirect operating costs increased by $385.3 million, or 74.9%, to $899.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\n \n\n\n•\nUFC direct operating costs increased by $46.8 million, or 12%. This increase was primarily due to higher costs of $30.5 million from different athlete matchups, as well as increased production costs primarily for UFC 306, which was a marquee event at the Sphere in Las Vegas. These increases were partially offset by lower expenses from direct costs of revenue resulting from having one less Fight Night event in the current year.\n\n\n•\nWWE contributed direct operating costs of $451.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $127.8 million for the period from September 12, 2023 through December 31, 2023 following its acquisition. These costs were primarily driven by $280.3 million of higher talent- and production-related costs associated with WWE’s premium live events, including \nWrestleMania XL\n events, and weekly television programming, as well as higher event-related costs associated with additional live events during the current year. \n\n\n•\nCorporate direct operating costs increased by $14.4 million. This increase was primarily related to service fees paid to Endeavor for various operational functions that support revenue generating activities pursuant to the Services Agreement. The costs associated with WWE's portion of the service fees did not commence until March 2024.\n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $679.6 million, or 123.8%, to $1,228.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\n \n\n\n•\nUFC selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $15.5 million, or 9%. This increase was primarily due to higher cost of personnel from greater headcount driven by the opening of the UFC Performance Institute in Mexico City in February 2024 and greater bonuses and sales commissions due to financial performance as compared to the prior year.\n\n\n•\nWWE contributed selling, general and administrative expenses of $351.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $134.4 million for the period from September 12, 2023 through December 31, 2023 following its acquisition. These costs were primarily driven by $102.6 million of personnel costs driven by the timing of the acquisition, which included a $23.4 million reduction in charges associated with restructuring activities related to the Transactions, as well as $57.7 million of increased travel expenses due to additional live events in the current year. The current year also includes $29.0 million of other operating expenses driven by the timing of the acquisition and impairment charges of $27.9 million as a result of reducing the carrying value of WWE assets held for sale to their fair value less cost to sell.\n\n\n•\nCorporate selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $446.9 million, or 187%. This increase was primarily due to higher legal costs of $388.5 million, including the legal settlement related to the UFC antitrust lawsuit of $375.0 million. The current year also included $69.2 million of higher cost of personnel and other operating expenses, including TKO executive compensation and other public company expenses following the Transactions, as well as $16.2 million of costs associated with the Company's debt refinancing activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in merger and acquisition costs of $61.2 million. The acquisition of WWE contributed $34.2 million of incremental expenses to Corporate, which was primarily driven by $13.1 million of increased personnel costs, as well as $21.1 million of other operating expenses, including $12.2 million related to service fees paid to Endeavor.\n\n\n \n51\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $228.2 million, or 138.6%, to $392.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to $227.6 million of expenses associated with the acquisition of WWE.\n\n\nInterest Expense, Net\n\n\nInterest expense, net increased by $10.1 million, or 4.2%, to $249.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to $13.4 million of expenses associated with the acquisition of WWE as well as borrowings under our revolving credit facility. These increases were slightly offset by lower indebtedness and the refinancing of the Credit Facilities in November 2024 that resulted in New Term Loans with a lower interest rate.\n\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, TKO recorded a provision for income taxes of $25.7 million compared to a provision of $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was primarily related to the change in impact from foreign operations.\n\n\nNet Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\n\n\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests was $3.0 million and $32.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to the change in the amount of reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 as well as the effect of the Transactions.\n\n\nSegment Results of Operations\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we classified our business into two reportable segments: UFC and WWE. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our segments based on segment Revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes segment Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability, and Adjusted EBITDA is used to evaluate the operating performance of our segments and for planning and forecasting purposes, including the allocation of resources and capital. Segment operating results reflect earnings before corporate expenses. These segment results of operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of the Company’s consolidated results of operations included above.\n\n\nThe following tables set forth Revenue

activities, including information technology, facilities, legal, human resources, finance, accounting, treasury, investor relations, corporate communications, community relations and compensation to TKO’s management and board of directors, which support both reportable segments. Corporate expenses also include service fees paid by the Company to Endeavor related to corporate activities as well as revenue generating activities under the Services Agreement.\n\n\nThe following table displays results for Corporate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(230.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(109.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $121.3 million, or 111%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The acquisition of WWE contributed incremental corporate expenses of $50.7 million, primarily driven by the cost of personnel and other general and administrative expenses. The remaining decrease was attributable to $44.9 million resulting from increases in cost of personnel, including TKO executive compensation, and other public company expenses following the Transactions, as well as $25.7 million of higher service fees paid to Endeavor. The costs associated with WWE's portion of the service fees did not commence until March 2024.\n\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income, excluding income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, merger and acquisition costs, certain legal costs, restructuring, severance and impairment charges, and certain other items when applicable. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue.\n\n\nTKO management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful to investors as the measures eliminate the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from its capital investments and intangible assets, and improve comparability by eliminating the significant level of interest expense associated with TKO’s debt facilities, as well as income taxes which may not be comparable with other companies based on TKO’s tax and corporate structure.\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used as the primary bases to evaluate TKO’s consolidated operating performance.\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of TKO’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\n\n•\nthey do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments;\n\n\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on TKO’s debt;\n\n\n•\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; and\n\n\n•\nthey are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in TKO’s statements of cash flows.\n\n\nTKO management compensates for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin along with other comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of TKO’s operating performance.\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered substitutes for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income as indicators of TKO’s financial performance, as measures of discretionary cash available to it to invest in the growth of its business or as measures of cash that will be available to TKO to meet its obligations. Although TKO uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as financial measures to assess the performance of its business, such use is limited because it does not include certain material costs necessary to operate TKO’s business. TKO’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as indications that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. These non-GAAP financial measures, as determined and presented by TKO, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Set forth below are reconciliations of TKO’s most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to these non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated basis.\n\n\n \n54\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n175.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n31.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n249.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n239.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n392.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n164.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity-based compensation expense (1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n94.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n57.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerger and acquisition costs (2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n83.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain legal costs (3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n401.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring, severance and impairment (4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n41.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebt transaction costs (5)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther adjustments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,251.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n809.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income margin\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nEquity-based compensation represents non-cash compensation expense for awards issued under Endeavor’s 2021 Plan subsequent to its April 28, 2021 IPO, for the Replacement Awards and for awards issued under the 2023 Incentive Award Plan. For the year ended December 31, 2024, equity-based compensation includes $17.7 million of expense associated with certain services provided by an independent contractor in the WWE segment. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, equity-based compensation includes $3.3 million and $19.9 million, respectively, of expense associated with accelerated vesting of the Replacement Awards related to the workforce reduction of certain employees in the WWE segment and Corporate.\n\n\n(2)\nIncludes (i) certain costs of professional fees and bonuses related to the Transactions and payable contingent on the closing of the Transactions primarily incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 and (ii) certain costs of professional advisors related to other strategic transactions, primarily the Endeavor Asset Acquisition, incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\n(3)\nIncludes costs related to certain litigation matters including antitrust lawsuits for UFC and WWE and matters where Mr. McMahon has agreed to make future payments to certain counterparties personally. For the year ended December 31, 2024, these costs include settlement charges of $375.0 million regarding the UFC antitrust lawsuit, as described in Note 21, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. For the year ended December 31, 2023, these costs included the settlement of a WWE antitrust matter for $20.0 million. \n\n\n(4)\nIncludes costs resulting from the Company’s cost reduction program during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, as described in Note 17, \nRestructuring Charges\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded impairment charges of $27.9 million as a result of reducing the carrying value of WWE assets held for sale to their fair value less cost to sell, as described in Note 5, \nSupplementary Data\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. \n\n\n(5)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred certain costs associated with the Credit Agreement Amendment, as described in Note 8, \nDebt\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\nSources and Uses of Cash\n\n\nCash flows from operations are used to fund TKO’s day-to-day operations, revenue-generating activities, and routine capital expenditures, as well as service its long-term debt, and are expected to be used to fund our capital return program.\n\n\nCredit Facilities\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, outstanding under a credit agreement dated August 18, 2016 (as amended and/or restated, the “First Lien Credit Agreement”), by and among Zuffa Guarantor, LLC (“Zuffa Guarantor”), UFC Holdings, LLC (“UFC Holdings”), as borrower, the lenders party hereto and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as Administrative Agent, which was entered into in connection with the acquisition of Zuffa by EGH in 2016. TKO Operating Company, LLC and TKO Group Holdings, Inc. are holding companies with limited business operations, cash flows, assets and liabilities other than the equity interests in the borrower entities Zuffa Guarantor and UFC Holdings. On November 21, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), UFC Holdings entered into the Fifth Refinancing Amendment (the “Credit Agreement Amendment”) to the First Lien Credit Agreement (as previously amended and/or restated, the “Existing Credit Agreement” and, as further amended by the Credit Agreement Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”).\n\n\n \n55\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Credit Agreement Amendment amended the Existing Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) refinance and replace the outstanding first lien secured term loans (the “Existing Term Loans”) with a new class of first lien secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $2,750.0 million (the “New Term Loans”), which now mature on November 21, 2031, (ii) refinance the existing secured revolving credit facility (the “Existing Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $205.0 million, which now matures on November 21, 2029 (the “New Revolving Credit Facility,” and, together with the New Term Loans, the “Credit Facilities”), and (iii) make certain other changes to the Existing Credit Agreement including as summarized below.  The Credit Facilities are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of Zuffa Guarantor and UFC Holdings and certain subsidiaries thereof.\n \n\n\nThe New Term Loans accrue interest at an annual interest rate equal to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus  2.25%, with a SOFR floor of 0.00%, which totaled 6.77% as of December 31, 2024. The Existing Term Loans accrued interest at an annual interest rate equal to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment plus 2.75%. The New Term Loans include 1% principal amortization payable in equal quarterly installments, with any remaining balance payable on the final maturity date of November 21, 2031.\n\n\nThe loans made pursuant to the New Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest at a variable interest rate equal to Term SOFR  plus 2.00%-2.25%, depending on the First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), with a SOFR floor of 0.00%\n \n\n\nOn the Closing Date, UFC Holdings borrowed $2,750.0 million of New Term Loans under the Credit Agreement to (i) repay the entire amount outstanding under the Existing Term Loans and (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with entering into the Credit Agreement Amendment.\n\n\nIn April 2024, UFC Holdings borrowed $150.0 million under its Existing Revolving Credit Facility to fund certain share repurchases that occurred during the second quarter of 2024, as discussed in Note 10, \nStockholders’ Equity\n. In June 2024, UFC Holdings fully repaid the $150.0 million outstanding. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no outstanding balance under the New Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n\nThe New Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2025, a First Lien Leverage Ratio of Consolidated First Lien Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 8.25-to-1. Prior to the Closing Date, Zuffa Guarantor was required to maintain a First Lien Leverage Ratio of no more than 6.5-to-1. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement Amendment, following the Closing Date, the Company is only required to comply with the foregoing financial covenant if the sum of outstanding borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any letters of credit, whether drawn or undrawn) is greater than the greater of (i) $85.0 million and (ii) forty percent of the borrowing capacity of the New Revolving Credit Facility. Prior to the Closing Date, this applicable testing condition was thirty-five percent of the borrowing capacity of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. This covenant did not apply as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 as UFC Holdings had no borrowings outstanding under either of the revolving credit facilities.\n\n\nUFC Holdings had no outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n\nRestrictions on Dividends\n\n\nThe Credit Agreement contains restrictions on TKO’s ability to make distributions and other payments from the respective credit groups. These restrictions on dividends include exceptions for, among other things, (1) amounts necessary to make tax payments, (2) a limited annual amount for employee equity repurchases, (3) distributions required to fund certain parent entities, (4) other specific allowable situations and (5) a general restricted payment basket, which generally provides for no restrictions as long as the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than 5.0x.\n\n\nOther Debt\n\n\nIn October 2018, UFC entered into a $28.0 million Loan Agreement and a $12.0 million Loan Agreement in order to finance the purchase of a building and its adjacent land (the “Secured Commercial Loans”). The Secured Commercial Loans have identical terms except the $28.0 million Loan Agreement is secured by a deed of trust for UFC’s headquarters building and underlying land in Las Vegas and the $12.0 million Loan Agreement is secured by a deed of trust for the acquired building and its adjacent land, also located in Las Vegas. The Secured Commercial Loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.62% (with a LIBOR floor of 0.88%). In May 2023, the parties amended the terms of the Secured Commercial Loans to replace the adjusted LIBOR reference rate with SOFR, and bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus 1.70%. Principal amortization of 4% is payable in monthly installments with any remaining balance payable on the final maturity date of November 1, 2028.\n \n\n\nThe applicable loan agreements each contain a financial covenant that requires UFC to maintain a Debt Service Coverage Ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreements of no less than 1.15-to-1 as measured on an annual basis (the “Secured Commercial Loan Covenant”). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, UFC was in compliance with the Secured Commercial Loan Covenant.\n\n\n \n56\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nCapital Return Programs\n\n\nOn October 24, 2024, we announced that the Board had authorized a share repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of its Class A common stock and the approval of a quarterly cash dividend pursuant to which holders of our Class A common stock will receive their pro rata share of approximately $75 million in quarterly distributions to be made by TKO OpCo. We will determine at our discretion the timing and the amount of any repurchases based on our evaluation of market conditions, share price, and other factors. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and we are not obligated to acquire any particular amount under the share repurchase program. The share repurchase program has no expiration, is expected to be completed within approximately three to four years and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.\n \n\n\nIn February 2025, we announced that our inaugural quarterly cash dividend will be paid on March 31, 2025. Future declarations of quarterly dividends are subject to our determination and discretion of based on our consideration of various factors, such as our results of operations, financial condition, market conditions, earnings, cash flow requirements, restrictions in our debt agreements and legal requirements and other factors that we deem relevant.\n\n\nCash Flows Overview\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n583.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n468.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(59.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(232.3\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(424.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOperating activities increased from $468.4 million of cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2023 to $583.4 million of cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2024. Cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2024 was higher than the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $182.7 million driven by the settlement agreement in the UFC antitrust lawsuit and the timing of bonus payments, partially offset by a decrease in net income for the period of $169.3 million, which included an increase in certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $228.2 million, equity-based compensation of $37.5 million and impairment charges of $27.9 million.\n\n\nInvesting activities decreased from $12.3 million of cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2023 to $59.0 million of cash used in the year ended December 31, 2024. Cash used in the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily reflects payments of $74.9 million for property, buildings and equipment and investments in affiliates of $23.5 million. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $28.4 million primarily related to the sale of WWE's owned properties in Stamford, Connecticut, as well as infrastructure improvement incentives received of $11.0 million. Cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily reflects $381.2 million of cash acquired from WWE as part of the Transactions partially offset by the payment of $321.0 million of deferred compensation in the form of a dividend to former WWE shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company also made purchases of $48.6 million related to payments for property, buildings and equipment.\n\n\nFinancing activities increased from $424.5 million of cash used in the year ended December 31, 2023 to $232.3 million of cash used in the year ended December 31, 2024. Cash used in the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily reflects share repurchases of $165.0 million, distributions to Endeavor and subsidiaries of $67.3 million. Cash used in the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily reflects net distributions to Endeavor and subsidiaries of $296.6 million, share repurchases of $100.0 million and net payments on debt of $33.4 million.\n \n\n\nFuture Sources and Uses of Liquidity\n\n\nTKO’s sources of liquidity are (1) cash on hand, (2) cash flows from operations and (3) available borrowings under the Credit Facilities (which borrowings would be subject to certain restrictive covenants contained therein). Based on its current expectations, TKO believes that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund its working capital requirements and to meet its commitments, including long-term debt service, for at least the next 12 months.\n\n\nTKO expects that its primary liquidity needs will be cash to (1) provide capital to facilitate organic growth of its business, (2) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to its employees, athletes and talent, (3) fund capital expenditures and investments, (4) pay interest and principal when due on the Credit Facilities, (5) pay income taxes, (6) reduce its outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facilities, (7) fund the legal settlements described in Note 21, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, (8) fund share repurchases as authorized by the Board and (9) make distributions to members and, in accordance with the Company's cash management policy, to TKO stockholders, including the planned quarterly dividend when declared by the Board.\n\n\n \n57\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\n\n\nThe following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024, aggregated by type:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAfter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term debt, principal payments (1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n29.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n29.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n29.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n53.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n27.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,613\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,780.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term debt, interest payments (2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n190.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n188.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n186.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n185.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n181.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n336.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,268.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating leases (3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n43.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance leases (3) (4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n447.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n571.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nService contracts and commitments (5)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n186.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n125.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n101.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n98.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n93.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n680.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal commitments\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n443.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n382.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n347.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n359.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n324.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,486.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,342.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nThe principal balance of certain debt is repaid on a quarterly basis, with the balance due at maturity.

Certain of these leases contain provisions for rent escalations or lease concessions. The obligations disclosed in the table above are presented on an undiscounted basis. See Note 20, \nLeases\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further detail.\n\n\n(4)\nOur finance lease payments include $334.4 million related to options to extend WWE’s global headquarters lease that are reasonably certain of being exercised.\n\n\n(5)\nSee Note 21, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further detail. \n\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \n\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates.\n\n\nWe believe the following estimates related to certain of our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. See Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nWe have revenue recognition policies for our various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business.\n\n\nIn accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers either at a point in time or over time, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 requires additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and estimates, and changes in those estimates.\n \n\n\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\n\nWe have various types of contracts with multiple performance obligations, primarily consisting of multi-year media rights, site fees, consumer products licensing and sponsorship agreements. The transaction price in these types of contracts is allocated on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. We typically determine the stand-alone selling price of individual performance obligations based on management estimates, unless stand-alone selling prices are observable through past transactions. Estimates used to determine a performance obligation’s stand-alone selling price impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized, but not the total amount of revenue to be recognized under the arrangement.\n\n\nPrincipal versus Agent\n\n\nWe enter into many arrangements that require management to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent. This determination involves judgment and requires evaluation as to whether the Company controls the goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. As part of this analysis, the Company considers whether we are primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise to provide the specified service, have inventory risk and have discretion in establishing prices. For events, this determination is primarily based on whether we own and control the event. For media rights distribution, this determination is primarily based on whether\n \n\n\n \n58\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nwe have control over the media rights including inventory risk and setting pricing with customers. For re-billable expenses related to advertising and brand activation services, this determination is primarily based on whether we are responsible for fulfillment of the services to the customer. If our determinations were to change, the amounts of our revenue and operating expenses may be different.\n\n\nTiming of Recognition\n\n\nMedia Rights and Content\n\n\nBroadcast and streaming rights fees received from distributors of our live event and television programming, both domestic and internationally, are recorded when the live event or program has been delivered and is available for distribution. Certain of our media rights are typically sold in multi-year arrangements and are generally comprised of multiple performance obligations that involve the allocation of transaction price based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. TKO uses its estimate of stand-alone selling price to allocate transaction price. Any advance payments received from distributors are deferred upon collection and recognized into revenue as content is delivered.\n\n\nWe recognize revenue from PPV programming from live sporting events when the event is aired. PPV programming is distributed through cable, satellite and digital providers. UFC and WWE receive a fixed license fee for its domestic residential PPV programming under long-term contracts. For UFC and WWE’s international and commercial PPV, the amount of revenue recognized is based upon management’s initial estimate of variable consideration related to the number of buys achieved. This initial estimate is based on preliminary buy information received from certain PPV distributors and is subject to adjustment as new information regarding the number of buys is received, which is generally up to 120 days subsequent to the live event. If our estimates of buys achieved were to change, the timing and amount of its revenue may be different.\n\n\nUFC owns and operates its own over-the-top (“OTT”) platform UFC FIGHT PASS that engages customers through a subscription based model. Subscriptions are offered to customers for one-month, six-month and 12-month access to UFC FIGHT PASS. WWE distributes content through its platform WWE Network, which collects licensing fees from distribution partners and collects monthly subscription fees. Subscription revenue for UFC FIGHT PASS and WWE Network is recognized ratably over each paid monthly membership period and revenue is deferred for subscriptions paid in advance until earned.\n \n\n\nLive Events\n\n\nLive event revenue is generally recognized at the time that an event occurs. Advance ticket sales, site fees and sales of VIP package are recorded as deferred revenue pending the event date.\n\n\nSponsorship\n\n\nCustomer contracts for advertising and sponsorship rights are generally comprised of multiple performance obligations that involve the allocation of the arrangement consideration to the underlying deliverables based upon their stand-alone selling price. We use an adjusted market assessment approach as our estimate of stand-alone selling price to allocate arrangement consideration as the performance obligations under customer contracts are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. After allocating revenue to each performance obligation, we recognize sponsorship revenue when the promotional service is delivered. If our estimates of stand-alone selling prices were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue may be different.\n\n\nConsumer Products Licensing\n\n\nConsumer products licensing revenue relates to royalties earned from sales of licensed merchandise and digital products. The nature of the licensing arrangements is typically symbolic intellectual property, inclusive of logos, trade names, and trademarks related to merchandise sales. Many licensing agreements include minimum guarantees, which set forth the minimum royalty to be paid during a given contract year. We will recognize the minimum guarantee revenue ratably over its related royalties’ contract period until such point that it is more likely than not that the total revenue during the royalty period will exceed the minimum royalty. If during the royalty period, management determines that total revenue will exceed the minimum royalty, the revenue recognized during each reporting period will reflect royalties earned on the underlying product sales. For licensing agreements without minimum guarantees, we recognize revenue related to the sales or usage of the underlying symbolic intellectual property over time as the sales or usage occurs. The amount of revenue recognized is based on either statements received or management’s best estimate of sales or usage in a period, if statements are received on a lag. If our estimates and judgments were to change, the timing and amount of revenue recognized may be different.\n\n\n \n59\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\nGoodwill is tested annually as of October 1 for impairment and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. We have two operating and reportable segments, consistent with the way management makes decisions and allocates resources to the business.\n \n\n\nWe have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. A qualitative assessment includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, and industry and market conditions. If we can support the conclusion that it is “not more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount under the qualitative assessment, we would not need to perform the quantitative impairment test for that reporting unit.\n \n\n\nIf we cannot support such a conclusion or we do not elect to perform the qualitative assessment then we must perform the quantitative impairment test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.\n\n\nThe discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses along with discount rates. Our long-term cash flow projections are estimates and inherently subject to uncertainty, particularly during periods of adverse economic conditions. Significant estimates and assumptions specific to each reporting unit may include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. Where a market approach is utilized, we use judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples. These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ.\n \n\n\nIf the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, such excess is recognized as an impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we performed a qualitative impairment test which resulted in no impairment charges.\n\n\nIntangible Assets\n\n\nFor finite-lived intangible assets that are amortized, we evaluate assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment or when the useful lives are no longer appropriate. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group’s long-lived assets. We define an asset group by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. If identified, the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value.\n\n\nDetermining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.\n \n\n\nEquity-Based Compensation\n\n\nWe grant equity awards to certain executives, employees and service providers, which may be in the form of various equity-based awards such as restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options.\n \n\n\nWe record compensation costs related to our equity awards issued to executives and other employees based on the grant date fair value of the award. Compensation cost for time-based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period and compensation cost for awards with a performance condition is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved. The awards with a performance condition are expensed when the achievement of performance conditions is probable. Compensation cost for performance-based awards with a market condition is recognized regardless of the number of units that vest based on the market condition and is recognized on straight-line basis over the estimated service period, with each tranche separately measured. Compensation expense is not reversed even if the market condition is not satisfied.\n\n\n \n60\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nReplacement Awards\n \n\n\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Company converted each WWE equity award of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) held by WWE directors, officers and employees into TKO RSUs and PSUs of equal value and vesting conditions (with such performance-vesting conditions equitably adjusted), respectively (the “Replacement Awards”). The value of the Replacement Awards was determined using the closing price of WWE Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“WWE Class A common stock”), on the day immediately preceding the closing of the Transactions. The portion of the Replacement Awards issued in connection with the Transactions that was associated with services rendered prior to the date of the Transactions was included in the total consideration transferred.\n \n\n\nWith regards to the remaining unvested portion of the Replacement Awards, equity-based compensation costs of RSUs are recognized over the total remaining service period on a straight-line basis with forfeitures recognized as they occur. RSUs have a service requirement and generally vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period. Unvested RSUs accrue dividend equivalents at the same rate as are paid on shares of Class A common stock. The dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting schedule as the underlying RSUs.\n \n\n\nPSUs, which are subject to certain performance conditions and have a service requirement, generally vest in equal installments over a three-year period. Until such time as the performance conditions are met, stock compensation costs associated with these PSUs are re-measured each reporting period based upon the fair market value of the Company’s common stock and the estimated performance attainment on the reporting date. The ultimate number of PSUs that are issued to an employee is the result of the actual performance of the Company at the end of the performance period compared to the performance conditions. Compensation costs for PSUs are recognized using a graded-vesting attribution method over the vesting period based upon the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved, with forfeitures recognized as they occur. Unvested PSUs accrue dividend equivalents once the performance conditions are met at the same rate as are paid on shares of Class A common stock. The dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting schedule as the underlying PSUs.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nTKO Group Holdings, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in March 2023. As the sole managing member of TKO OpCo, TKO Group Holdings, Inc. ultimately controls all business and affairs of UFC and WWE. TKO Group Holdings, Inc. is subject to corporate income taxes on its share of taxable income of TKO OpCo. TKO OpCo is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is therefore generally not subject to U.S. corporate income tax, other than entity-level income taxes in certain U.S. state and local jurisdictions. TKO OpCo’s foreign subsidiaries are subject to entity-level taxes, and TKO OpCo’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to foreign withholding taxes on sales in certain foreign jurisdictions which are included as a component of foreign current taxes.\n\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant factors considered by us in estimating the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets include expectations of future earnings and taxable income, as well as application of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A valuation allowance is provided when we determine that it is “more likely than not” that a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our deferred tax positions may change if our estimates regarding future realization of deferred tax assets were to change.\n\n\nA minimum probability threshold for a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The tax benefits ultimately realized by us may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors, including our decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and our success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.\n \n\n\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included in the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n\nConsolidation\n\n\nWe typically consolidate entities in which we own more than 50% of the voting common stock and control operations, as well as variable interest entities (“VIE”) for which we are deemed the primary beneficiary.\n \n\n\nEvaluating whether an entity in which we have a variable interest is a VIE and whether we are the primary beneficiary may require management to make significant judgments involving evaluating the fair value and capitalization of the investee along with the most significant activities of the entity and the party that has power over those activities.\n \n\n\n \n61\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\n\nWe account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Additionally, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, among other items. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\nNon-Controlling Interests\n\n\nNon-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries represent the component of common equity in consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties. Non-controlling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are redeemable outside of our control are considered redeemable non-controlling interests and are classified as temporary equity on the consolidated balance sheet. Redeemable non-controlling interests are recorded at the greater of carrying value, which is adjusted for the non-controlling interests’ share of net income or loss, or estimated redemption value at each reporting period. Estimating the fair value or other redemption value requires management to make estimates and assumptions specific to each non-controlling interest including revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, discount rates under the income approach and other assumptions such as market multiples for comparable companies. These estimates and assumptions may vary between each redeemable non-controlling interest depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that consolidated subsidiary.\n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\nSee Note 3, \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information on certain accounting standards that have been recently adopted or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations.\n\n\nIte\nm 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\n\nTKO is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact TKO’s financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\n\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the floating interest component on our long-term debt. The Credit Facilities bear interest at floating rates and we regularly monitor and manage interest rate risks. Holding debt levels constant as of December 31, 2024, a 1% increase in the effective interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately $28 million.\n\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\n\nWe have operations in several countries outside of the United States, and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies, principally the British Pound and the Brazilian Real. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. These changes could adversely affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of TKO’s non-U.S. dollar revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for its content and services, all of which could negatively affect TKO’s business, financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories.\n\n\nHolding other variables constant (such as interest rates and debt levels), if the U.S. dollar appreciated by 10% against the foreign currencies used by TKO’s operations in the year ended December 31, 2024, revenues would have decreased by approximately $6.6 million and operating income would have decreased by approximately $0.2 million.\n\n\nWe regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures. TKO does not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes.\n\n\n \n62\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nCredit Risk\n\n\nTKO maintains its cash and cash equivalents with various major banks and other high quality financial institutions, and its deposits at these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions and the failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents or any inability to access or delays in our ability to access our funds could adversely affect our business and financial position.\n\n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary \nData\n\n\nThe Financial Statements required by this Item 8 appear beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report and are incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nIte\nm 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nIte\nm 9A.  Controls and Procedures\n\n\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\n\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n\nThe Company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.\n\n\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2024, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is below.\n\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n63\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nTKO Group Holdings, Inc.:\n\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited TKO Group Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ / members’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financing Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n \n\n\n/s/ \nKPMG LLP\n\n\nNew York, New York\n\n\nFebruary 26, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n64\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\nRevenue recognition - contracts with multiple performance obligations\n\n\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its customers. For customer contracts with more than one distinct performance obligation, the total contract consideration is allocated based on management’s estimate of each distinct performance obligation’s relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). The Company’s primary sources of revenue include media rights and content, live events, sponsorships, and consumer products licensing. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded revenue of $2,804.3 million.\n\n\nWe identified the assessment of revenue recognition for certain contracts with multiple performance obligations as a critical audit matter. Specifically, for certain multi-year fixed fee contracts, complex auditor judgment was required in assessing the Company’s identification of distinct performance obligations and evaluating the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the SSP for those identified distinct performance obligations.\n\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s revenue processes, including controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations and the method and significant assumptions used to determine the estimated SSP for those identified distinct performance obligations. For a selection of new and amended multi-year fixed fee contracts, we obtained and\n \n\n\n \nF-\n2\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nevaluated the Company’s revenue recognition accounting analysis by (1) inspecting the contracts to gain an understanding of contractual terms and conditions, evaluating the rights and obligations of the Company, and comparing them to other similar customer contracts to identify distinct performance obligation, (2) interviewing the Company’s business development personnel to gain an understanding of the nature and estimated value of commitments made to customers, (3) evaluating the method and significant assumptions used to estimate SSP by comparing the SSP to current pricing patterns in similar customer contracts, and (4) testing that the estimated SSPs were accurately applied in allocating the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation.\n\n\n \n\n\n/s/ \nKPMG LLP\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nNew York, New York\n\n\nFebruary 26, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nF-\n3\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\n \n\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of TKO Group Holdings, Inc.\n\n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of TKO Group Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders'/members’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

DESCRIPTIO\nN OF BUSINESS\nTKO Group Holdings, Inc. (the “Company” or “TKO”) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in March 2023, under the name New Whale Inc., and was formed for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”) and World Wrestling Entertainment, LLC (f/k/a World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.) (“WWE”) businesses under TKO Operating Company, LLC (f/k/a Zuffa Parent, LLC) (“Zuffa” or “TKO OpCo”), which owns and operates the UFC and WWE businesses (the “Transactions”), as contemplated within the Transaction Agreement, dated as of April 2, 2023, by and among Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (“Endeavor” or “EGH”), Endeavor Operating Company, LLC, TKO OpCo, WWE, TKO, and Whale Merger Sub Inc. (the “Transaction Agreement”). On September 12, 2023, the Transactions were completed with the newly-formed TKO combining the UFC and WWE businesses. See Note 4, \nAcquisition of WWE\n, for further details. Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, (A) EGH and/or its subsidiaries received (1) a \n51.0\n% controlling non-economic voting interest in TKO on a fully-diluted basis and (2) a \n51.0\n% economic interest in the operating subsidiary on a fully diluted basis, TKO OpCo, which owns all of the assets of the UFC and WWE businesses, and (B) the stockholders of WWE received (1) a \n49.0\n% voting interest in TKO on a fully diluted basis and (2) a \n100\n% economic interest in TKO, which in turn holds a \n49.0\n% economic interest in TKO OpCo on a fully-diluted basis.\nTKO OpCo is the accounting acquirer and predecessor to TKO. Financial results and information included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include (1) prior to the consummation of the Transactions, financial results and information of Zuffa and its consolidated subsidiaries, which includes UFC and its subsidiaries, and (2) after the consummation of the Transactions, financial results and information of TKO Group Holdings, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries, which includes UFC and WWE and their respective subsidiaries.\nUnless the context suggests otherwise, references to the “Company” or “TKO” refer to Zuffa and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Transactions and to TKO Group Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries after the consummation of the Transactions.\nTKO is a premium sports and entertainment company which operates leading combat sports and sports entertainment brands. The Company monetizes its media and content properties through four principal activities: Media rights and content, Live events, Sponsorship and Consumer products licensing.\n\n\n2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for reporting financial information.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and other subsidiaries in which a controlling voting interest is maintained, which is typically present when the Company owns a majority of the voting interest in an entity and the non-controlling interests do not hold any substantive participating rights. In addition, the Company evaluates its relationships with other entities to identify whether they are variable interest entities as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, \nConsolidation\n, and to assess whether it is the primary beneficiary of such entities. If the determination is made that the Company is the primary beneficiary, then that entity is consolidated. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Non-controlling interest in subsidiaries are reported as a component of equity or temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheets with disclosure of the net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to the Company and the non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates and joint ventures where the Company has significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control. Investments in which the Company does not have significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for either at fair value if the fair value is readily determinable or at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes if the fair value is not readily determinable.\nTKO is the sole managing member of TKO OpCo and maintains a controlling financial interest in TKO OpCo. As sole managing member, the Company ultimately controls the business affairs of TKO OpCo. As a result, the Company is the primary beneficiary and thus consolidates the financial results of TKO OpCo and reports a non-controlling interest representing the economic interest in TKO OpCo held by the other members of TKO OpCo. As of December 31, 2024, the Compa\nny owned \n47.5\n% \nof TKO OpCo.\n\n\n \nF-\n10\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying disclosures.\nSignificant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, content cost amortization and impairment, the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities associated with acquisitions, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units and the assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment, determination of useful lives of intangible assets and long-lived assets acquired, the fair value of equity-based compensation, leases, income taxes and contingencies.\nManagement evaluates these estimates using historical experience and other factors, including the general economic environment and actions it may take in the future. The Company adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, these estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on management's best judgment at a point in time and as such, these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. Changes in estimates resulting from weakness in the economic environment or other factors beyond the Company's control could be material and would be reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnder ASC Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n (“ASC Topic 606”), our sales revenue is recognized when products are delivered or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers either at a point in time or over time, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\n \nWe have various types of contracts with multiple performance obligations, primarily consisting of multi-year media rights, site fees, consumer products licensing and sponsorship agreements. The transaction price in these types of contracts is allocated on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. We typically determine the stand-alone selling price of individual performance obligations based on management estimates, unless stand-alone selling prices are observable through past transactions. Estimates used to determine a performance obligation’s stand-alone selling price impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized, but not the total amount of revenue to be recognized under the arrangement.\nOur pay-per-view programming revenue and consumer products licensing revenue include variable consideration in the form of sales or usage-based royalties. The variability related to these sales or usage-based royalties will be resolved in the periods when the licensee generates sales related to the intellectual property license.\nOur payment terms vary by the type of products or services offered, and are generally subject to contractual payment terms, which may include advance payment requirements. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. Our contracts with customers do not result in significant obligations associated with returns, refunds or warranties. Our revenues do not include material amounts of variable consideration other than the sales or usage based royalties earned related to our consumer products licensing and certain media rights and content contracts which are subject to contractual payment terms.\nThe following are the primary sources of revenue earned by the Company:\nMedia Rights and Content\nBroadcast rights fees received from distributors of the Company’s live event and television programming, both domestically and internationally, are recorded when the live event or program has been delivered and is available for distribution. Any advance payments received from customers are deferred upon collection and recognized into revenue as content is delivered. Revenue from the Company’s pay-per-view programming is recognized when the event is aired and, for those contracts with variable fees, is based upon its initial estimate of the number of buys achieved. This initial estimate is based on preliminary buy information received from certain pay-per-view distributors and any adjustments to the estimated amounts are recorded when final information is received. Pay-per-view programming is distributed through cable, satellite, and digital providers to residential and commercial establishments. The Company’s customer is the cable, satellite, and certain digital providers on residential buys and the Company records its royalties earned on the sales of pay-per-view programming. For other residential buys through UFC-branded digital platforms, the Company’s customer is the end user, and the Company records the amount paid by the end customer. On commercial buys, the Company recognizes the amount paid by the establishment. The Company owns and operates its own over-the-top (“OTT”) platforms, UFC FIGHT PASS and WWE Network, that engage customers through a monthly subscription-based model. Access to UFC FIGHT PASS and WWE Network is provided to subscribers and revenue is recognized ratably over each paid monthly membership period. Revenue  for UFC FIGHT PASS and WWE Network is deferred for subscriptions paid in advance until earned. The Company recognizes revenue for UFC FIGHT PASS and WWE Network gross of third-party distributor fees as the Company is the principal in the arrangement.\n\n\n \nF-\n11\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nLive Events\nLive event revenue consists of ticket sales, site fees and VIP package sales for events at third-party venues, each of which generally represents distinct performance obligations. Revenue for ticket sales and site fees collected in advance of the events is recorded as deferred revenue until the events occur. The Company recognizes revenue gross of third-party commissions and fees as the Company is the principal in the arrangement.\nSponsorship\nThrough our sponsorship packages, the Company offers our customers a full range of promotional vehicles, including arena and octagon signage, digital and broadcast content, on-air announcements, special appearances by fighters and talent as well as other forms of advertisement. The Company allocates the transaction price to all performance obligations contained within a sponsorship arrangement based upon their relative stand-alone selling price. Stand-alone selling prices are typically consistent with the rate card used to determine pricing for individual components. After allocating revenue to each performance obligation, the Company recognizes sponsorship revenue when the promotional services are delivered. Revenue is recognized gross of third-party commissions and fees as the Company is the principal in the arrangement. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the sponsorship inventory and being primarily responsible to our customers.\nConsumer Products Licensing\nRevenue is derived from licensing the Company’s logos, trade names, trademarks and related symbolic intellectual property to third party manufacturers and distributors of branded merchandise. Revenue from royalties is recognized based on the Company’s estimates of sales that occurred with subsequent adjustments recognized upon receipt of a statement or other information from the customer. Many licensing agreements include minimum guarantees, which set forth the minimum royalty to be paid to the Company during a given contract year. The Company will recognize the minimum guarantee revenue ratably over its related royalty period until such point that it is more likely than not that the total revenue during the royalty period will exceed the minimum royalty. If during the royalty period, management determines that total revenue will exceed the minimum royalty, the revenue recognized during each reporting period will reflect royalties earned on the underlying product sales.\nDirect Operating Costs\nDirect operating costs primarily include third-party expenses associated with our athletes and talent, production, marketing, venue costs related to the Company’s live events, and commissions and direct costs with distributors, as well as certain service fees paid to Endeavor.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs as well as rent, travel, professional service costs and other overhead required to support the Company’s operations and corporate structure, including certain service fees paid to Endeavor.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposit accounts and highly liquid money market accounts with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.‌\n \nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various major banks and other high-quality financial institutions. The Company periodically evaluates the relative credit standings of these banks and financial institutions. The Company’s accounts receivable are typically unsecured and a significant portion relates to trade receivables for events from various distributors, who collect and remit payments to the Company from individual operators as well as large broadcast and cable television and streaming networks with whom the Company licenses content. Significant portions of trade receivables also relate to third party venues.‌\nAs of December 31, 2024\n, there was \none\n customer that accounted for 10% or more of the Company's accounts receivable. As of December 31, \n2023\n, there were \nno\n customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, \n2024\n, there were two customers, \none\n included within the UFC segment and \none\n included within the WWE segment, who accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenue. For the years ended December 31, \n2023 and 2022\n, there was \none\n customer included within the UFC segment who accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue.‌\n\n\n \nF-\n12\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to the risk associated with interest rates on variable rate borrowings. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company recognizes derivative financial instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the interest rate swap agreements depends on whether they have been designated and qualify as part of a hedging relationship and the type of hedging relationship. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item affects earnings. For derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is an estimate of expected losses. In determining the amount of the reserve, the Company makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on known delinquent activity or disputes and ongoing credit evaluations in addition to evaluating the historical loss rate on the pool of receivables. Accounts receivable includes unbilled receivables, which are established when revenue is recognized, but due to contractual restraints over the timing of invoicing, the Company does not have the right to invoice the customer by the balance sheet date.‌\nDeferred Costs\nDeferred costs principally relate to payments made to third-party vendors in advance of events taking place, upfront contractual payments and prepayments on media and licensing rights fees and advances for content production or overhead costs. These costs are recognized when the event takes place or over the respective period of the media and licensing rights.\nProperty, Buildings and Equipment\nProperty, buildings and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is charged against income over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYears\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuildings\n\n\n \n\n\n35\n - \n40\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\n\n \n\n\nLesser of useful life or lease term\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurniture, fixtures, office and other equipment\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n - \n28.5\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction equipment\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n - \n7\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer hardware and software\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n - \n5\n years\n\n\n\n\n \nCosts of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at contract inception. The Company has elected the short-term lease exemption, whereby leases with initial terms of one year or less are not capitalized and instead expensed generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has also elected to not separate lease components from non-lease components across all lease categories. Instead, each separate lease component and non-lease component are accounted for as a single lease component. The Company is primarily a lessee with a lease portfolio comprised mainly of real estate and equipment leases. The right-of-use asset and lease liability are measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, with the right-of-use asset being subject to adjustments such as initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. Due to the rate implicit in each lease not being readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental collateralized borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The lease term includes periods covered by options to extend when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise such options as well as periods subsequent to an option to terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain the Company will not exercise the termination option. Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the Company records interest expense on the lease liability and straight-line amortization of the right-of-use asset over the lease term. Variable lease costs are recognized as incurred.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe \nCompany accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses, including management’s estimation of the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition\n \n\n\n \nF-\n13\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\ndate. \nThe excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually as of October 1 for im\npairment and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is “more likely than not” to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount under the qualitative assessment, the Company would not need to perform the quantitative impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, then the Company must perform the quantitative impairment test. When the Company performs a quantitative test, it records the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Charges resulting from an impairment test are recorded in impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations.‌\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of trade names and customer relationships. Intangible assets with finite lives are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are as follows:‌\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYears\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrademarks and trade names\n\n\n \n\n\n7\n - \n25\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers relationships\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n - \n18\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternally developed technology\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n - \n8\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n - \n4\n years\n\n\n\n\n \n \nFor intangible assets that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment or when the useful lives are no longer appropriate. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value, which is recorded in impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations.‌\nInvestments\nFor equity method investments, the Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below carrying value. For equity investments without readily determinable fair value, the Company performs a qualitative assessment at each reporting period. A variety of factors are considered when determining if an impairment exists, including, among others, the financial condition and business prospects of the investee, as well as the Company’s investment intent.‌\n \nContent Costs\nThe Company incurs costs to produce and distribute film and television content, which are either monetized on a title-by-title basis or as a group through subscriptions from customers. These costs include development costs, direct costs of production as well as direct negative costs incurred in the physical production of the film. From time to time, the Company acquires films to distribute exclusively through its \nUFC Fight Pass\n subscription network. The Company also licenses films for distribution exclusively through its \nUFC Fight Pass\n subscription network. Content costs are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Depending on the predominant monetization strategy, content costs are amortized over the estimated period of ultimate revenue subject to an individual-film-forecast model or over the estimated usage of the film group. Such amortization is recorded in direct operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company produces live sports and taped content, which represent content costs predominantly monetized on a title-by-title basis that has a limited life to sell in secondary markets. As such, the Company recognizes all of the revenue associated with film and television costs when the programs are delivered and made available for telecast in the initial market resulting in simultaneously expensing all of the related film and television costs. Costs incurred in acquiring, licensing, and producing content for distribution on UFC Fight Pass are predominantly monetized as a film group, and are amortized straight-line over the shorter of the license term or the estimated period of use, which is currently \nthree years\n. These estimates are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjustments, if any, will result in changes to amortization rates.\n\n\n \nF-\n14\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nUnamortized content costs are also tested for impairment based on the predominant monetization strategy whenever there is an impairment indication, as a result of certain triggering events or changes in circumstances, whereby the fair value of the individual film and television content or collectively with others as a film group may be less than its unamortized costs. The impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the individual film and television content or collectively with others as a film group to the carrying value of the unamortized content costs. Where the unamortized content costs exceed the fair value, the excess is recorded as an impairment charge in the consolidated stat\nements of operations. \nNo\n impairment charges were recognized during the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 or 2022\n.\nContent Production Incentives\nAs there is no authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP on accounting for government assistance to for profit business entities, the Company accounts for content production incentives by analogy to International Accounting Standard (\"IAS\") 20, \nAccounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance\n.\nThe Company has access to various governmental programs primarily related to WWE that are designed to promote content production within the United States and certain international jurisdictions. Tax incentives earned with respect to expenditures on qualifying film production activities are included as an offset to other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Tax incentives earned with respect to expenditures on qualifying capital projects are included as an offset to property, buildings and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Tax incentives earned with respect to expenditures on qualifying television and other production activities are recorded as an offset to production expenses within direct operating costs within the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes these benefits when we have reasonable assurance regarding the realizable amount of the tax credits. The realizable amount is recorded within accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets until the Company receives the funds from the respective governmental jurisdiction.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nCosts incurred in connection with the issuance of the Company’s long-term debt have been recorded as a direct reduction against the debt and amortized over the life of the associated debt as a component of interest expense using the effective interest method. Costs incurred with the issuance of the Company’s revolving credit facilities have been deferred and amortized over the term of the facilities as a component of interest expense using the straight-line method. These deferred costs are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.‌\n \nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value measurements are categorized within a fair value hierarchy, which is comprised of three categories. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe carrying values reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments.\nThe Company’s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include investments, long-lived assets and goodwill. These assets are not measured and adjusted to fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to periodic evaluations for potential impairment (Note 6 and Note 7). The resulting fair value measurements of the assets are considered to be Level 3 measurements.‌\n \nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries represent the component of equity in consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is retained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and non-controlling interests. In addition, when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value and the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the retained interest will be recorded as a gain or loss.\nNon-controlling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are not solely within the Company’s control are considered redeemable non-controlling interests. Redeemable non-controlling interests are considered to be temporary equity and are reported in the mezzanine section between total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Redeemable non-controlling interests are recorded at the greater of carrying value, which is adjusted for the non-controlling interests’ share of net income or loss, or estimated redemption value at each reporting period. If the carrying value, after the income or loss attribution, is below the estimated redemption value at each reporting period, the Company remeasures the redeemable non-controlling interests to its redemption value.\n\n\n \nF-\n15\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nEquity-Based Compensation\nIncentive Awards\nEquity-based compensation is accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, \nCompensation-Stock Compensation\n. The Company records compensation costs related to its incentive awards. Equity-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Compensation cost for time-based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period with forfeitures recognized as they occur. Compensation cost for performance-based awards with a performance condition is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved. See Note 13, \nEquity-Based Compensation\n, for further discussion of the Company’s equity-based compensation.\n \nReplacement Awards\n \nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Company converted each WWE equity award of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) held by WWE directors, officers and employees into TKO RSUs and PSUs of equal value and vesting conditions (with such performance-vesting conditions equitably adjusted), respectively (the “Replacement Awards”). The value of the Replacement Awards was determined using the closing price of WWE Class A common stock, par value $\n0.01\n per share (“WWE Class A common stock”), on the day immediately preceding the closing of the Transactions. The portion of the Replacement Awards issued in connection with the Transactions that was associated with services rendered prior to the date of the Transactions was included in the total consideration transferred.\n \nWith regards to the remaining unvested portion of the Replacement Awards, equity-based compensation costs of RSUs are recognized over the total remaining service period on a straight-line basis with forfeitures recognized as they occur. RSUs have a service requirement and generally vest in equal annual installments over a \nthree-year\n period. Unvested RSUs accrue dividend equivalents at the same rate as are paid on shares of TKO Class A common stock, par value $\n0.00001\n per share (the “TKO Class A common stock”). The dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting schedule as the underlying RSUs.\n \nPSUs, which are subject to certain performance conditions and have a service requirement, generally vest in equal installments over a \nthree-year\n period. Until such time as the performance conditions are met, stock compensation costs associated with these PSUs are re-measured each reporting period based upon the fair market value of the Company’s common stock and the estimated performance attainment on the reporting date. The ultimate number of PSUs that are issued to an employee is the result of the actual performance of the Company at the end of the performance period compared to the performance conditions. Compensation costs for PSUs are recognized using a graded-vesting attribution method over the vesting period based upon the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved, with forfeitures recognized as they occur. Unvested PSUs accrue dividend equivalents once the performance conditions are met at the same rate as are paid on shares of TKO Class A common stock. The dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting schedule as the underlying PSUs.\nEarnings per Share\nEarnings per share (“EPS”) is computed in accordance with ASC 260, \nEarnings per Share\n. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the net income (loss) available to holders of TKO Class A common stock by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) available for holders of TKO Class A common stock by the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for that period. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the dilutive effect of additional shares of TKO Class A common stock issuable in exchange for redemption of certain non-controlling interests, outstanding convertible debt instruments, as well as under the Company’s share based compensation plans (if dilutive), with adjustments to net income (loss) available for common stockholders for dilutive potential common shares.\nShares of the Company’s Class B common stock, par value $\n0.00001\n per share (the “TKO Class B common stock”) do not share in the earnings or losses of the Company and are therefore not participating securities. As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share of TKO Class B common stock under the two-class method has not been presented. However, shares of TKO Class B common stock outstanding for the period are considered potentially dilutive shares of TKO Class A common stock under application of the if-converted method and are included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share, except when the effect would be anti-dilutive.\nIncome Taxes\nTKO Group Holdings, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in March 2023. As the sole managing member of TKO OpCo, TKO Group Holdings, Inc. ultimately controls the business and affairs of UFC and WWE. TKO Group Holdings, Inc. is subject to corporate income taxes on its share of taxable income of TKO OpCo. TKO OpCo is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is therefore generally not subject to U.S. corporate income tax. TKO OpCo’s foreign subsidiaries are subject to entity-level taxes. TKO OpCo’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to withholding taxes on sales in certain foreign jurisdictions which are included as a component of foreign current taxes. TKO OpCo is subject to entity-level income taxes in certain U.S. state and local jurisdictions.\n\n\n \nF-\n16\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant factors considered by the Company in estimating the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets include expectations of future earnings and taxable income, as well as the application of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company determines that it is “more likely than not” that a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n \nASC 740 prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected.\n \nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included in the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company has operations outside of the United States. Therefore, changes in the value of foreign currencies affect the consolidated financial statements when translated into U.S. Dollars. The functional currency for substantially all subsidiaries outside the U.S. is the local currency. Financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period end exchange rates as to the assets and liabilities and monthly average exchange rates as to revenue, expenses and cash flows. For these countries, currency translation adjustments are recognized in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), whereas transaction gains and losses are recognized in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized $\n0.6\n million, $\n1.1\n million and $\n1.3\n million of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively.‌\n\n\n3.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n. This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The Company adopted this guidance for the year ended December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis. See Note 19, \nSegment Information\n, for further detail.\nIn July 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-03, \nPresentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), and Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718)\n. This ASU amends or supersedes various SEC paragraphs within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) to conform to past SEC announcements and guidance issued by the SEC. The Company adopted this guidance on July 1, 2023 with no material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, \nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging—Portfolio Layer Method\n. This ASU clarifies the guidance in ASC 815 on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios of financial assets, expanding the scope of this guidance to allow entities to apply the portfolio layer method to portfolios of all financial assets, including both prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets. The amendments in this update were effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2023 with no material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, \nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\n. This ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Adoption of the expedients and exceptions was permitted upon issuance of this update through December 31, 2022. However, in December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, in order to defer the sunset date of ASC 848 until December 31, 2024. The Company adopted this guidance on April 1, 2023 with no material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\n\n\n \nF-\n17\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, \nBusiness Combinations – Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement\n. This ASU requires that a joint venture apply a new basis of accounting upon formation. The amendments in this update are effective prospectively for all joint venture formations with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025, with an option to apply the amendments retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period in which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, \nDisclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative\n. This ASU amends the ASC to incorporate certain disclosure requirements from SEC Release No. 33-10532, \nDisclosure Update and Simplification\n, which was issued in 2018. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC's removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. If, by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the ASC and will not become effective.\n \nThe Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. This ASU requires that an entity annually disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate) as well as income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02, \nCodification Improvements – Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements\n. This ASU amends the ASC to remove references to various FASB Concepts Statements to simplify the ASC and draw a distinction between authoritative and nonauthoritative literature. The amendments in this update apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance, and are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period in which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nIncome Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n, and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01, \nIncome Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date\n. ASU 2024-03, as clarified by ASU 2025-01, improves expense disclosures by requiring disclosure of additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, and should be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date, or (2) retrospectively to any or all periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n\n4.  ACQUISITION OF WWE\nTransactions Overview\nOn September 12, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), the transaction between EGH and WWE was completed with the newly-formed TKO combining the UFC and WWE businesses. Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, (A) EGH and/or its subsidiaries received (1) a \n51.0\n% controlling non-economic voting interest in TKO on a fully-diluted basis and (2) a \n51.0\n% economic interest on a fully-diluted basis in the operating subsidiary, TKO OpCo, which owns all of the assets of the UFC and WWE businesses after the closing of the Transactions, and (B) the stockholders of WWE received (1) a \n49.0\n% voting interest in TKO on a fully-diluted basis and (2) a \n100\n% economic interest in TKO, which in turn holds a \n49.0\n% economic interest in TKO OpCo on a fully-diluted basis.\nWWE is an integrated media and entertainment company that has been involved in the sports entertainment business for four decades. WWE is principally engaged in the production and distribution of unique and creative content through various channels, including content rights agreements for its flagship programs, \nRaw,\n \nSmackDown \nand \nNXT\n, premium live event programming, monetization across social media outlets, live events, and licensing of various WWE-themed products.\nThe Transactions have been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of WWE using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the guidance of ASC 805, \nBusiness Combinations\n (“ASC 805”), with TKO OpCo, the legal acquiree, treated as the\n \n\n\n \nF-\n18\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\naccounting acquirer. Based on this determination, the Company has allocated the purchase price to the fair value of WWE’s identifiable assets and liabilities as of the Closing Date, with the excess preliminary purchase price recorded as goodwill. The goodwill was assigned entirely to the WWE segment and is not deductible for tax purposes.\n \nThe weighted average life of finite-lived intangible assets acquired was \n20.3\n years, which consisted of trademarks and trade names with a weighted average life of \n25.0\n years, customer relationships with a weighted average life of \n11.3\n years and other intangible assets with a weighted average life of \n3.6\n years. See Note 6, \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n, for the estimated annual amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Transactions for the next five years and thereafter.\nIn connection with the Transactions, the Company incurred transaction costs of $\n1.9\n million and $\n83.8\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024 and 2023, respectively, which were expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nConsideration Transferred\nThe fair value of the consideration transferred in the reverse acquisition was $\n8,432.1\n million, which consisted of \n83,161,123\n shares of TKO Class A common stock valued at $\n8,061.8\n million, Replacement Awards valued at $\n49.3\n million and $\n321.0\n million of deferred consideration which was paid on September 29, 2023 to former WWE shareholders in the form of a special dividend.\nPursuant to the Transactions, awards of WWE RSUs and PSUs outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Transactions were converted into awards of TKO RSUs or PSUs, as applicable, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to the Closing Date. The portion of the fair-value-based measure of the Replacement Awards that is attributable to pre-combination vesting is purchase consideration and was valued at approximately $\n49.3\n million.\nAllocation of Purchase Price\nThe purchase price is allocated to the underlying WWE assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the Closing Date, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the synergies that are expected to arise as a result of the Transactions and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The purchase price allocation reflects fair value estimates, including measurement period adjustments, based on management analysis, including work performed by third-party valuation specialists. The effects of measurement period adjustments made during the year ended December 31, 2024 were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nA summary of the final purchase price allocation is as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n381,153\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts receivable\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n105,237\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther current assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n89,256\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty, buildings and equipment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n398,004\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntangible assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrademarks and trade names\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,188,200\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer relationships\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n900,500\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n128,300\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,063,067\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance lease right of use assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n257,359\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating lease right of use assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,337\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,007\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25,928\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n379,601\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n124,280\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n16,934\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n54,190\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance lease liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n255,940\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating lease liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n12,224\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther long-term liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2,527\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional paid-in-capital (1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n283,591\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet assets acquired\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,432,061\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n(1)\nThe additional paid-in-capital amount represents incremental goodwill related to deferred tax liabilities recorded at TKO’s parent company in connection with the acquisition of WWE.\n\n\n \nF-\n19\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nThe fair value of the nonredeemable non-controlling interest of $\n4,521.8\n million was calculated as EGH’s initial \n51.9\n% ownership interest in TKO OpCo’s net assets.

The remaining pro forma adjustments are primarily related to incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on the fair values and useful lives of each identifiable intangible asset, incremental service fees paid by the Company to Endeavor pursuant to the Services Agreement, incremental compensation expense for two key executives, including salaries, bonuses and TKO equity awards granted, and incremental equity-based compensation related to the Replacement Awards.\n\n\n5.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $\n2.7\n million to fully write off this investment due to the business's decision to wind down operations.\nIn July 2024, the Company paid $\n15.0\n million in exchange for an approximately \n5\n% ownership stake in EverPass, LLC, which owns a live sports media platform that assists in distributing live sports and entertainment content to bars, restaurants, hotels and other commercial venues. The Company also made an additional pro rata capital contribution of $\n2.0\n million in September 2024. The Company has accounted for this investment using the equity method of accounting and will recognize its proportionate share of income or loss in future periods.\nExcluding the impact of the impairment charge noted above, the Company recognized equity earnings of $\n0.4\n million, equity losses of $\n0.3\n million and equity losses of $\n0.2\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from our equity method investments.

In addition, there were \nno\n observable price change events that were completed during the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 or 2022.\nThe fair value measurements of the Company’s equity investments and nonmarketable equity investments without readily determinable fair values are classified within Level 3 as significant unobservable inputs are used as part of the determination of fair value. Significant unobservable inputs may include variables such as near-term prospects of the investees, recent financing activities of the investees, and the investees' capital structure, as well as other economic variables, which reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing these assets. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the Company has elected to use the measurement alternative to fair value that will allow these investments to be recorded at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes.\n\n\n8.

TKO Operating Company, LLC and TKO Group Holdings, Inc. are holding companies with limited business operations, cash flows, assets and liabilities other than the equity interests in the borrower entities Zuffa Guarantor and UFC Holdings. On November 21, 2024 (the “Credit Agreement Closing Date”), UFC Holdings entered into the Fifth Refinancing Amendment (the “Credit Agreement Amendment”) to the First Lien Credit Agreement (as previously amended and/or restated, the “Existing Credit Agreement” and, as further amended by the Credit Agreement Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”).\nThe Credit Agreement Amendment amended the Existing Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) refinance and replace the outstanding first lien secured term loans (the “Existing Term Loans”) with a new class of first lien secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $\n2,750.0\n million (the “New Term Loans”), which now mature on November 21, 2031, (ii) refinance the existing secured revolving credit facility (the “Existing Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $\n205.0\n million, which now matures on November 21, 2029 (the “New Revolving Credit Facility,” and, together with the New Term Loans, the “Credit Facilities”), and (iii) make certain other changes to the Existing Credit Agreement including as summarized below.  The Credit Facilities are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of Zuffa Guarantor and UFC Holdings and certain subsidiaries thereof.\n \nThe New Term Loans accrue interest at an annual interest rate equal to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus  \n2.25\n%, with a SOFR floor of \n0.00\n%, which totaled \n6.77\n% as of December 31, 2024\n. The New Term Loans include \n1\n% principal amortization payable in equal quarterly installments, with any remaining balance payable on the final maturity date of November 21, 2031.\n\n\n \nF-\n24\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nThe loans made pursuant to the New Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest at a variable interest rate equal to Term SOFR plus \n2.00\n%-\n2.25\n%, depending on the First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), with a SOFR floor of \n0.00\n%.\nOn the Credit Agreement Closing Date, UFC Holdings borrowed $\n2,750.0\n million of New Term Loans under the Credit Agreement to (i) repay the entire amount outstanding under the Existing Term Loans and (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with entering into the Credit Agreement Amendment. The Company incurred $\n19.4\n million in transactions costs related to the Credit Agreement Amendment. Of this amount, $\n16.2\n million related to modification arrangements which are included within selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, while the remaining $\n3.2\n million associated with new lenders entering the syndication were capitalized as a component of long-term debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\n \nIn April 2024, UFC Holdings borrowed $\n150.0\n million under its Existing Revolving Credit Facility to fund certain share repurchases that occurred during the second quarter of 2024, as discussed in Note 10, \nStockholders’ Equity\n. In June 2024, UFC Holdings fully repaid the $\n150.0\n million outstanding. As of December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, there was \nno\n outstanding balance under the New Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe New Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2025, a First Lien Leverage Ratio of Consolidated First Lien Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of \n8.25\n-to-1. Prior to the Credit Agreement Closing Date, Zuffa Guarantor was required to maintain a First Lien Leverage Ratio of no more than \n6.5\n-to-1. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement Amendment, following the Credit Agreement Closing Date, the Company is only required to comply with the foregoing financial covenant if the sum of outstanding borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility is (excluding any letters of credit, whether drawn or undrawn) is greater than the greater of (i) $\n85.0\n million and (ii) \nforty\n percent of the borrowing capacity of the New Revolving Credit Facility. Prior to the Credit Agreement Closing Date, this applicable testing condition was \nthirty-five\n percent of the borrowing capacity of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. This covenant did not apply as of December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n as UFC Holdings had \nno\n borrowings outstanding under either of the revolving credit facilities.\nUFC Holdings had \nno\n outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, \n2024 and 2023.\nThe Credit Facilities restrict the ability of certain subsidiaries of the Company to make distributions and other payments to the Company. These restrictions include exceptions for, among other things, (1) amounts necessary to make tax payments, (2) a limited annual amount for employee equity repurchases, (3) distributions required to fund certain parent entities, (4) other specific allowable situations and (5) a general restricted payment ba\nsket, which generally provides for no restrictions as long as the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than \n5.0\nx.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, TKO Group Holdings, Inc. held net long-term deferred income tax liabilities of $\n310.6\n million. Otherwise, TKO Group Holdings, Inc. has no material separate cash flows or assets or liabilities other than the investments in its subsidiaries. All its business operations are conducted through its operating subsidiaries; it has no material independent operations. TKO Group Holdings, Inc. has no other material commitments or guarantees. As a result of the restrictions described above, substantially all of the subsidiaries’ net assets are effectively restricted from being transferred to TKO Group Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2024.\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s New Term Loans are based on quoted market values for the debt. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the face amount of the Company’s New Term Loans and Existing Term Loans approximates its fair value.\nSecured Commercial Loans\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, the Company had $\n30.3\n million and $\n31.9\n million, respectively, of secured loans outstanding, which were entered into in October 2018 in order to finance the purchase of a building and its adjacent land (the “Secured Commercial Loans”). The Secured Commercial Loans have identical terms except one of the Loan Agreements is secured by a deed of trust for the UFC’s headquarters building located at 6650 S. Torrey Pines Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada and underlying land and the other Loan Agreement is secured by a deed of trust for a building located at 6650 El Camino Road, Las Vegas, Nevada and its adjacent land. In May 2023, the parties amended the terms of the Secured Commercial Loans to replace the adjusted LIBOR reference rate with SOFR and bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus \n1.70\n%. Principal amortization of \n4\n% is payable in monthly installments with any remaining balance payable on the final maturity date of \nNovember 1, 2028\n.\nThe Secured Commercial Loans contain a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of consolidated debt to Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the applicable loan agreements of no less than \n1.15\n-to-1 \nas measured on\n \n\n\n \nF-\n25\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nan \nannual basis.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nIn October 2018, in connection with the Secured Commercial Loans, the Company entered into a swap for $\n40.0\n million notional effective November 1, 2018 with a termination date of November 1, 2028. The swap required the Company to pay a fixed rate of \n4.99\n% and receive the total of LIBOR plus \n1.62\n%, which totaled \n3.97\n% as of December 31, 2018. The Company entered into this swap to hedge certain of its interest rate risks on its variable rate debt. The Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are party to its financial transactions. The Company has designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge, and all changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged interest payments affect earnings.\nIn May 2023, the Company amended its Secured Commercial Loans and associated interest rate swap to replace the LIBOR reference rate with Term SOFR. The swap requires the Company to pay a fixed rate of \n4.99\n% and receive the total of SOFR plus \n1.70\n%, which\n totaled \n6.24\n%\n as of December 31, 2024.\n \nPrior to the May 2023 amendment the fair value of the swap was based on commonly quoted monthly LIBOR rates.  Subsequent to this amendment, the fair value of the swap is based on commonly quoted monthly Term SOFR rates.  Both the LIBOR and Term SOFR reference rates are considered observable inputs representing a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the swap w\nas $\n0.7\n mi\nllion and $\n0.3\n million as of December 31, \n2024 and 2023, respectively, and was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The total change in fair value of the swap’s asset position included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was a decrease \nof $\n0.4\n m\nillion, an increase of $\n0.3\n million and a decrease of $\n4.9\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively. The Company reclassified $\n0.3\n million of the increase in fair value into net income during each of the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n, respectively, representing the amortization of the cash flow hedge fair value to net income.\n\n\n10.

Holders of TKO Class B common stock are not entitled to receive dividends and will not be entitled to receive any distributions upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company.\n \nOn September 12, 2023, the Company issued \n83,161,123\n shares of TKO Class A common stock to the historic WWE stockholders and \n89,616,891\n shares of TKO Class B common stock to EGH and certain of its subsidiaries.\n\n\n \nF-\n26\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\n \nSecondary Offering & Share Repurchases\nIn November 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with TKO OpCo, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representative of the various underwriters (collectively, the “Underwriters”), and Mr. McMahon, in connection with the underwritten secondary offering by Mr. McMahon of \n8,400,000\n shares of TKO Class A common stock at an offering price of $\n79.80\n per share (the “Secondary Offering”). The Secondary Offering closed on November 14, 2023. The Company did \nno\nt offer any shares of TKO Class A common stock in the Secondary Offering and did \nno\nt receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock in the Secondary Offering.\n \nPursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company agreed to purchase \n1,308,729\n shares of TKO Class A common stock from the Underwriters, at a price of $\n76.41\n per share, which was equal to the price being paid by the Underwriters to Mr. McMahon, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of approximately $\n100.0\n million (the “Share Repurchase”). The Company funded the Share Repurchase with approximately $\n100.0\n million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. All shares repurchased have been retired.\n \nOn April 7, 2024, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Mr. McMahon, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase \n1,853,724\n shares of TKO Class A common stock held by Mr. McMahon at a per share price of $\n89.01\n for an aggregate of $\n165.0\n million (the “Share Repurchase”). The Company funded the Share Repurchase with approximately $\n150.0\n million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and with cash on hand. All shares repurchased have been retired.\nAs of December 31, 2024\n, the Company owned \n47.5\n% of TKO OpCo, and EGH and its subsidiaries owned \n52.5\n% of TKO OpCo.\nAs of December 31, 2024\n, EGH and its subsidiaries collectively controlled \n53.9\n% of the voting interests in TKO through their ownership of both Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nEndeavor Share Purchases\nIn April 2024, WME IMG, LLC (“WME IMG”), an indirect subsidiary of Endeavor, entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vincent K. McMahon, pursuant to which WME IMG agreed to purchase 1,642,970 shares of TKO Class A common stock held by Mr. McMahon at a per share price of $\n89.01\n for an aggregate amount of $\n146.2\n million.\n \nIn December 2024, WME IMG and Endeavor OpCo purchased \n863,847\n shares of TKO Class A common stock in the open market at an average per share price of $\n145.32\n for an aggregate amount of $\n125.5\n million.\nThese shares of TKO Class A common stock purchased by WME IMG and Endeavor OpCo are included in the calculation of Endeavor’s total voting interest in TKO as of December 31, 2024.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, and through the date of this Annual Report, Endeavor OpCo purchased an additional \n1,897,650\n shares of TKO Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $\n300.9\n milli\non under Endeavor's 10b5-1 trading plan for the Company. The trading plan was terminated on February 14, 2025.\nCapital Return Program\nOn October 24, 2024, the Company announced that its board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to $\n2.0\n billion of its Class A common stock and the approval of a quarterly cash dividend pursuant to which holders of TKO's Class A common stock will receive their pro rata share of approximately $\n75\n million in quarterly distributions to be made by TKO OpCo.\nThe Company will determine at its discretion the timing and the amount of any repurchases based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, and other factors. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and the Company is not obligated to acquire any particular amount under the share repurchase program. The share repurchase program has no expiration, is expected to be completed within approximately three to four years and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.\nIn February 2025, we announced that our inaugural quarterly cash dividend will be paid on March 31, 2025. Future declarations of quarterly dividends are subject to the determination and discretion of the Company based on its consideration of various factors, such as its results of operations, financial condition, market conditions, earnings, cash flow requirements, restrictions in its debt agreements and legal requirements and other factors that the Company deems relevant.\nPrincipal Stockholder Contributions\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024\n and 2023, the Company received cash contributions of $\n6.4\n million and $\n5.8\n million, and non-cash capital contributions of $\n1.5\n million and $\n9.0\n million, \nrespectively. The cash contributions represented amounts reimbursed to the Company by Mr. McMahon, a principal holder of TKO Class A common stock, in connection with and/or arising from the\n \n\n\n \nF-\n27\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\ninvestigation \nconducted by a Special Committee of the former WWE board of directors. The non-cash capital contributions represented amounts paid personally by Mr. McMahon to certain counterparties. See Note 22, \nRelated Party Transactions\n, for additional information.\n\n\n11.  NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS\nNonredeemable Non-Controlling Interest in TKO OpCo\nIn connection with the business acquisition of WWE described in Note 4, \nAcquisition of WWE\n, on September 12, 2023, the Company became the sole managing member of TKO OpCo and, as a result, consolidates the financial results of TKO OpCo. The Company reports a non-controlling interest representing the economic interest in TKO OpCo held by the other members of TKO OpCo. TKO OpCo’s operating agreement provides that holders of membership interests in TKO OpCo (“Common Units”) may, from time to time, require TKO OpCo to redeem all or a portion of their Common Units (and an equal number of shares of TKO Class B common stock) for cash or, at the Company’s option, for shares of TKO Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. In connection with any redemption or exchange, the Company will receive a corresponding number of Common Units, increasing the total ownership interest in TKO OpCo. Changes in the ownership interest in TKO OpCo while the Company retains its controlling interest in TKO OpCo will be accounted for as equity reallocation transactions. As such, future redemptions or direct exchanges of Common Units in TKO OpCo by the other members of TKO OpCo will result in a change in ownership and reduce the amount recorded as non-controlling interest and increase additional paid-in capital.\nRedeemable Non-Controlling Interest in the UFC\nIn July 2018, the Company received an investment of $\n9.7\n million by third parties (the “Russia Co-Investors”) in a newly formed subsidiary of the Company (the “Russia Subsidiary”) that was formed to expand the Company’s existing UFC business in Russia and certain other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The terms of this investment provide the Russia Co-Investors with a put option to sell their ownership in the Russia Subsidiary beginning five years and six months after the consummation of the investment. The purchase price of the put option is the greater of the total investment amount, defined as the Russia Co-Investors’ cash contributions less cash distributions, or fair value. As of December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, the estimated redemption value was $\n21.9\n million and $\n11.2\n million, respectively.\nThe changes in carrying value of the redeemable non-controlling interest were as follows (in thousands):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance — December 31, 2021\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,700\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest holders\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,747\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccretion\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1,539\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance — December 31, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,908\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest holders\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,686\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance — December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n11,594\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest holders\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,234\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccretion\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,036\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance — December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n21,864\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nF-\n28\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\n12.  EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is calculated utilizing net income (loss) available to common stockholders of the Company during the year ended December 31, 2024 and during the period from September 12, 2023 through December 31, 2023, divided by the weighted average number of shares of TKO Class A common stock outstanding during the same period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the diluted weighted average shares outstanding during the same periods. The Company’s outstanding equity-based compensation awards under its equity-based compensation arrangements (see Note 13, \nEquity-based Compensation\n) were anti-dilutive during the periods.\nThe following table presents the computation of based and diluted net earnings (loss) per share and weighted average number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except share and per share data):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPeriod From\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 12 -\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic and diluted net loss per share\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerator\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to TKO Group Holdings, Inc.\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,408\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n35,227\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of dilutive securities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjustment to net income attributable to TKO Group Holdings, Inc. from the assumed conversion of Class B shares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n6,613\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to TKO Group Holdings, Inc. used in computing diluted earnings (loss) per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,795\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n35,227\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenominator\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average Class A Common Shares outstanding - Basic\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n81,340,472\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n82,808,019\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of dilutive securities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional shares from RSUs and PSUs, as calculated using the treasury stock method\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n917,177\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional shares from the assumed conversion of Class B shares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n89,616,891\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average number of shares used in computing diluted earnings (loss) per share\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n171,874,540\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n82,808,019\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic earnings (loss) per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n0.43\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.02\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n0.43\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurities that are anti-dilutive this period\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnvested RSUs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,636,626\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnvested PSUs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n327,403\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTKO Class B Common Shares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n89,616,891\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n13.  EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION\nIn connection with the initial public offering of EGH, EGH’s board of directors adopted the Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. 2021 Incentive Award Plan, which became effective April 28, 2021 and was amended and restated effective April 24, 2023 (the “EGH 2021 Plan”).

Various jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of enacting legislation to adopt GloBE rules and other countries are expected to adopt GloBE rules in the future. While changes in tax laws in the various countries in which the Company operates can negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and financial position in future periods, the Company’s impact related to the adoption of the GloBE rules, effective January 1, 2024, was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial position.\n\n\n \n\n\n16.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2023, the Company implemented an ongoing cost reduction program, primarily related to realizing synergy opportunities and integrating the combined operations of WWE and UFC, which resulted in the recording of termination benefits for a workforce reduction of certain employees and contract termination costs for independent contractors in the WWE segment and Corporate group. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $\n17.3\n and $\n41.4\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024 and 2023\n, respectively. These amounts include equity-based compensation expenses of $\n3.3\n million and $\n19.9\n million for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These restructuring charges are recorded in accrued liabilities and additional paid-in-capital on the consolidated balance sheets and within direct operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, respectively.\n \nChanges in the Company’s restructuring liability through December 31, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance — December 31, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring charges (excluding share-based compensation expense)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21,459\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n11,734\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance — December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,725\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring charges (excluding share-based compensation expense)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,978\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n20,471\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance — December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,232\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18.  CONTENT PRODUCTION INCENTIVES\nThe Company has access to various governmental programs that are designed to promote content production within the United States of America and certain international jurisdictions. These programs primarily consist of nonrefundable tax credits issued by a jurisdiction on an annual basis for qualifying expenses incurred during the year in the production of certain entertainment content created in whole or in part within the jurisdiction. The Company recognizes these benefits when we have reasonable assurance regarding the realizable amount of the tax credits.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded content production incentives of\n $\n13.6\n million and $\n13.1\n million \nrelated to qualifying content production activities, respectively. These incentives are recorded as an offset to production\n \n\n\n \nF-\n36\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nexpenses \nwithin direct operating costs on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

These incentives are recorded as an offset to property, buildings and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company did \nno\nt record any infrastructure improvement incentives during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023.\n\n\n \n\n\n19.  SEGMENT INFORMATION\nPrior to the acquisition of WWE, the Company operated as a single reportable segment. Subsequent to the acquisition of WWE and effective September 12, 2023, the Company identified \ntwo\n reportable segments: UFC and WWE, to align with how the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), the \nChief Executive Officer\n, manages the businesses, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions. The UFC segment consists entirely of the operations of the Company’s UFC business which was the sole reportable segment prior to the acquisition of WWE, while the WWE segment consists entirely of the operations of the WWE business acquired on September 12, 2023.\nThe Company also reports the results for the “Corporate” group. The Corporate group reflects operations not allocated to the UFC or WWE segments and primarily consists of general and administrative expenses. These expenses relate largely to corporate activities, including information technology, facilities, legal, human resources, finance, accounting, treasury, investor relations, corporate communications, community relations and compensation to TKO’s management and board of directors, which support both reportable segments. Corporate expenses also include service fees paid by the Company to Endeavor related to certain corporate activities as well as certain revenue generating activities under the Services Agreement.\n \nThe profitability measure employed by the Company’s CODM for allocating resources and assessing operating performance is Adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income, excluding income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, merger and acquisition costs, certain legal costs, restructuring, severance and impairment charges, and certain other items when applicable. Adjusted EBITDA includes amortization expenses directly related to supporting the operations of the Company’s segments, including content production asset amortization. The Company's CODM considers budget-to-actual and quarter-over-quarter variances when making decisions about allocating capital and personnel to the segments. The Company believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view the Company’s segment performance in the same manner as the Company’s CODM to evaluate segment performance and make decisions about allocating resources. Additionally, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a primary measure used by media investors, analysts and peers for comparative purposes.\nThe Company does not disclose assets by segment information. The Company does not provide assets by segment information to the Company’s CODM, as that information is not typically used in the determination of resource allocation and assessing business performance of each reportable segment. A significant portion of the Company’s assets following the Transactions represent goodwill and intangible assets arising from the Transactions.\nThe following tables present summarized financial

LEASES\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company’s lease portfolio consisted of operating and finance leases, in which the Company is the lessee, primarily for real estate property for offices around the world. In addition, the Company has various live event production service arrangements that contain operating and finance equipment leases. The Company’s real estate leases have remaining lease terms of approximate\nly \none year\n to \n26 ye\nars\n, some of which include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company’s equipment leases, which are included as part of various operating service arrangements, generally have remaining lease terms of approximately \none year\n to \nsix years\n. Generally, no covenants are imposed by the Company’s lease agreements.\n \nOn May 21, 2024, the Company amended its WWE global headquarters lease to reduce the leased space by approximately \n20,025\n rentable square feet. The lease reduction will result in rental savings of approximately $\n13.9\n million over the remainder of the initial \n15\n-year base term. The lease amendment requires a partial termination fee of approximately $\n2.2\n million to be paid in installments through November 15, 2025. No other material changes were made to the existing lease terms. The lease amendment was accounted for as a lease modification during the second quarter of 2024, which resulted in a reduction to the Company’s finance lease liability and finance lease right-of-use asset of $\n21.4\n million and $\n20.8\n million, respectively, and a gain on the partial termination of $\n0.6\n million recorded as a component of other income (expense), net, within the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024.\n \n\n\n \nF-\n39\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nQuantitative Disclosures Related to Leases\nThe following table provides quantitative disclosure about the Company’s operating and finance leases for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance lease costs:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization of right-of-use assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n20,724\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,427\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest on lease liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,446\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,997\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating lease costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,156\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,525\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,158\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther short-term and variable lease costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,086\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,480\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n936\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal lease costs\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n48,412\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n17,429\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,094\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther information\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating cash flows from finance leases\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n19,446\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,945\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,769\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,382\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,748\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance cash flows from finance leases\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12,111\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n938\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance \nlease liabilities (1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n22,937\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n257,359\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating \nlease liabilities (1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,857\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n14,630\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,378\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) -

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company has certain commitments, including various service contracts with vendors as well as service fees paid by the Company to Endeavor under the Services Agreement.

The commitments in the table above include $\n68.2\n million, $\n70.7\n million, $\n71.4\n million, $\n72.2\n million, $\n72.9\n million and $\n51.1\n million related to the Services Agreement in 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029 and thereafter, respectively.\n \nThe Company’s future commitments related to its debt obligations and its operating and finance leases are separately disclosed in Note 8, \nDebt\n, and Note 20, \nLeases\n, respectively.\nEndeavor Asset Acquisition\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company and TKO OpCo entered into a definitive agreement with subsidiaries of Endeavor to acquire the Professional Bull Riders (“PBR”), On Location, and IMG businesses. Under the terms of the agreement, TKO will acquire the Endeavor assets for total consideration of $\n3.25\n billion, based on the volume-weighted average sales price of TKO’s Class A common stock for the twenty five trading days ending on October 23, 2024. Endeavor will receive approximately \n26.1\n million common units of TKO OpCo and will subscribe for an equal number of shares of TKO’s Class B common stock (subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments to be settled at the closing in equity and cash). \nUpon the close of the Endeavor Asset Acquisition, Endeavor expected to own \napproximately \n61\n% of the voting interests of TKO through its holdings of shares of TKO Class A common stock and TKO Class B common stock which are paired with common units of TKO OpCo.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting interests of TKO common stock in favor of adopting the transaction agreement (which has been satisfied by delivery of a written consent by such stockholders). The transaction will be accounted for as a merger between entities under common control due to Endeavor’s control of the Company and the Endeavor assets being acquired. Therefore, upon closing of the Endeavor Asset Acquisition, the net assets of the Endeavor assets being acquired will be combined with those of the Company at their historical carrying amounts and the results will be presented on a combined basis for historical periods because they were under common control for all periods presented.\n \nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings, claims and governmental investigations arising in the normal course of business. The types of allegations that arise in connection with such legal proceedings vary in nature, but can include, among others, contract, employment, tax and intellectual property matters. The Company evaluates all cases and records liabilities for losses from legal proceedings when the Company determines that it is probable that the outcome will be unfavorable and the amount, or potential range, of loss can be reasonably estimated. While any outcome related to litigation or such governmental proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the outcome of these matters, except as otherwise may be discussed below, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nUFC Legal Proceedings\n \nFive\n related class-action lawsuits were filed against Zuffa between December 2014 and March 2015 by a total of \neleven\n former UFC fighters. The lawsuits, which were substantially identical, were transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Nevada and consolidated into a single action in June 2015, captioned\n Le et al. v. Zuffa, LLC\n, No. 2:15-cv-1045-RFB-BNW (D. Nev.) (the “\nLe\n” case). The lawsuit alleged that Zuffa violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by monopsonizing an alleged market for the services of elite professional MMA athletes. The fighter plaintiffs claimed that Zuffa’s alleged conduct injured them by artificially depressing the compensation they received for their services. The plaintiffs sought treble damages under the antitrust laws, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs, and, in some instances, injunctive relief. On August 9, 2023, the district court certified the lawsuit as a damages class action, encompassing the period from December 16, 2010 to June 30, 2017. The fighter plaintiffs in the \nLe \ncase abandoned their claim for injunctive relief, so the only relief the fighter plaintiffs would have sought at trial was damages. On June 24, 2021, another\n \n\n\n \nF-\n41\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nlawsuit, \nJohnson et al. v. Zuffa, LLC et al.\n, No. 2:21-cv-1189-RFB-BNW (D. Nev.) (the “Johnson” case), was filed by a putative class of former UFC fighters and covering the period from July 1, 2017, to the present. The \nJohnson \ncase alleged substantially similar claims to the \nLe \ncase and sought injunctive relief. On September 26, 2024, following the court's denial of an earlier proposed settlement agreement, the Company reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted in the \nLe\n case for an aggregate amount of $\n375.0\n million payable in installments over an agreed-upon period of time by the Company (the “Updated Settlement Agreement”). The terms of the Updated Settlement Agreement have been memorialized in a long-form agreement, which the court preliminarily approved on October 22, 2024 and finally approved on February 6, 2025. In connection with the Updated Settlement Agreement, the Company recorded charges of $\n375.0\n million during the year ended December 31, 2024, which are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company paid $\n125.0\n million of the aggregate $\n375.0\n million settlement amount into escrow in late October 2024, shortly following receipt of preliminary approval, and another $\n125.0\n million into escrow in February 2025 shortly following receipt of final approval, in accordance with the terms of the Updated Settlement Agreement. The Company expects to make an additional payment covering the remaining $\n125.0\n million in the second quarter of 2025. The Company anticipates that the settlement amount will be deductible for tax purposes. No trial date has been set in the \nJohnson \naction.\nWWE Legal Proceedings\n \nAs announced in June 2022, a Special Committee of independent members of WWE’s board of directors (the “Special Committee”) was formed to investigate alleged misconduct by WWE’s then-Chief Executive Officer, Vincent K. McMahon (the “Special Committee investigation”). Mr. McMahon initially resigned from all positions held with WWE on July 22, 2022 but remained a stockholder with a controlling interest and served as Executive Chairman of WWE’s board of directors from January 9, 2023 through September 12, 2023, at which time Mr. McMahon became Executive Chair of the Board of Directors of the Company. Although the Special Committee investigation is complete and, in January 2024, Mr. McMahon resigned from his position as Executive Chair and member of the Company’s Board of Directors, as well as other positions, employment and otherwise, at TKO and its subsidiaries, WWE has received, and may receive in the future, regulatory, investigative and enforcement inquiries, subpoenas, demands, claims and/or complaints arising from, related to, or in connection with these matters. On July 17, 2023, federal law enforcement agents executed a search warrant and served a federal grand jury subpoena on Mr. McMahon. On January 10, 2025, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission settled charges against Mr. McMahon for failing to disclose certain settlement agreements to WWE’s Board of Directors, legal department, accountants, financial reporting personnel, or auditor, and in so doing, circumventing WWE’s system of internal accounting controls and causing material misstatements in WWE’s 2018 and 2021 financial statements. No charges have been brought against the Company.\nOn January 25, 2024, a former WWE employee filed a lawsuit against WWE, Mr. McMahon and another former WWE executive in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging, among other things, that she was sexually assaulted by Mr. McMahon and asserting claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\nOn October 23, 2024, \nfive\n unnamed plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Mr. McMahon, Linda McMahon, WWE, and TKO in Maryland court, alleging sexual abuse by a former WWE employee during the 1980s.\nOn November 17, 2023, a purported former stockholder of WWE, Laborers’ District Council and Contractors’ Pension Fund of Ohio (“Laborers”), filed a verified class action complaint on behalf of itself and similarly situated former WWE stockholders in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (“Delaware Court”), captioned \nLaborers District Council and Contractors’ Pension Fund of Ohio v. McMahon, \nC.A. No. 2023-1166-JTL (“\nLaborers \nAction”).  On November 20, 2023, another purported former WWE stockholder, Dennis Palkon, filed a verified class action complaint on behalf of himself and similarly situated former WWE stockholders in the Delaware Court, captioned \nPalkon v. McMahon\n, C.A. No. 2023-1175-JTL (“\nPalkon \nAction”). The \nLaborers\n and \nPalkon \nActions allege breach of fiduciary duty claims against former WWE directors Mr. McMahon, Nick Khan, Paul Levesque, George A. Barrios, Steve Koonin, Michelle D. Wilson, and Frank A. Riddick III (collectively, the “Individual Defendants”), arising out of the Transactions. On April 24, 2024, the City of Pontiac Reestablished General Employees’ Retirement System (“Pontiac”), a purported former stockholder of WWE, filed another verified class action complaint on behalf of itself and similarly situated former WWE stockholders in the Delaware Court captioned \nCity of Pontiac Reestablished General Employees’ Retirement System v. McMahon\n, C.A. No. 2024-0432 (“\nPontiac \nAction”). The Pontiac Action similarly alleges breach of fiduciary duty claims against the Individual Defendants and added claims against WWE and TKO for denying stockholders their appraisal rights under DGCL § 262, as well as claims against EGH for aiding and abetting the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and for civil conspiracy to violate DGCL § 262. On May 2, 2024, the Court entered an order consolidating the \nLaborers\n,\n Palkon \nand\n Pontiac\n actions under the caption \nIn re World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. Merger Litigation\n, C.A. No. 2023-1166-JTL (“Consolidated Action”). On August 8, 2024, the Delaware Court appointed the Laborers and \nPalkon \nplaintiffs as co-lead plaintiffs, and the co-lead plaintiffs subsequently designated the \nPalkon\n complaint as operative. As a result, WWE, TKO and EDR are no longer defendants. On October 24, 2024, the Delaware Court entered a stipulation dismissing all claims against Messrs. Koonin and Riddick, who, therefore, are no longer defendants. The remaining Individual Defendants filed answers to the complaint on October 28, 2024 and discovery is currently underway.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nF-\n42\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22.

McMahon, who served as Executive Chair of the Company’s Board of Directors until January 26, 2024, previously controlled a significant portion of the voting interests of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.\n \nMr. McMahon has agreed to make future payments to certain counterparties personally. In accordance with the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5T, \nMiscellaneous Accounting, Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholders\n (“Topic 5T”), the Company concluded that these amounts should be recognized by the Company as expenses in the period in which they become probable and estimable. These payments are considered non-cash capital contributions and are included as a component of principal stockholder contributions in our consolidated statements of stockholders’/members’ equity.\n \nIn connection with the acquisition of WWE, the Company assumed $\n3.5\n million of liabilities related to future payments owed by Mr. McMahon to certain counterparties. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $\n3.5\n million of expenses associated with payments made directly by Mr. McMahon to certain counterparties. These costs are included within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and 2023, Mr. McMahon made payments of $\n1.5\n million and $\n5.5\n million, respectively, associated with these liabilities to certain counterparties directly. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $\n3.5\n million of costs associated with payments made directly by Mr. McMahon related to WWE’s global headquarters lease. These costs are included within finance lease right-of-use assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Since these liabilities existed when Mr. McMahon controlled a significant portion of the voting interests of the Company’s common stock, these payments are considered non-cash capital contributions and are included as principal stockholder contributions in our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.\nIn connection with and/or arising from the investigation conducted by a Special Committee of the former WWE board of directors, Mr. McMahon has agreed to reimburse the Company for additional costs incurred in connection with and/or arising from the same matters. During the years ended December 31, 2024\n and 2023, Mr. McMahon reimbursed the Company $\n6.4\n million and $\n5.8\n million, respectively, associated with these costs.
