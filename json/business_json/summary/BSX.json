  "item1_summary": " The considerations and risks that follow are organized within relevant headings but may be relevant to other headings as well . The medical device markets in which we participate are highly competitive . Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations .\n Digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities, have and may continue to increase in their applicability and importance to various aspects of our business, operating and competitive environments, research and development pipeline and product portfolio . We believe we will need to develop new and enhanced digital capabilities and competences in order to remain competitive .\n Competitive activity, increased market power of our customers as the health care industry consolidates, national and regional government tenders, economic pressures experienced by our customers, staffing shortages within health care facilities that have and may continue to negatively impact demand for our products . There can be no assurance that the size of the markets in which we compete will increase, that we will be able to hold or gain market share .\n Health care cost containment pressures, government payment and delivery system reforms, changes in private payer policies, and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products . We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry .\n The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services is critical to the success of medical technology companies . Reimbursement and funding vary by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies . We may find limited demand for otherwise promising new products unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payers .\n If there were a general economic slowdown or recession, we may experience decreased customer spending or demand for our products and services . The same economic conditions could also adversely affect our third-party vendors, including those that we utilize in our supply-chain and manufacturing operations . Continued inflationary pressure may also increase certain operational costs, including due to wage increases, or increases in the cost of materials or components . Global pandemics or other public health crises could cause disruptions in global economic activity .\n Uncertain or challenging global economic conditions could also lead to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . A slowdown in the global economy or sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain European and Asian countries . Such terminations of, or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs could have a negative impact on our cash flow .\n International net sales accounted for 39 percent of our global net sales in 2024 . An important part of our strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the U.S. We are subject to a number of market, business, financial, legal, legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations .\n Most countries outside of the U.S. require product approvals be renewed or re-certified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there . Economic pressure to contain health care costs can lead to more rigorous evidence requirements and lower reimbursement rates for either our products directly or procedures in which our products are used .\n Global businesses, including those in the medical device industry, are facing increasing scrutiny of, and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to, their international operations . Failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny, civil and/or criminal proceedings, sanctions and other liabilities . There may be greater uncertainty and market volatility following U.S. and global elections .\n Any significant changes in the political, economic, financial, competitive, legal and regulatory conditions where we conduct, or plan to expand, our international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations . Sanctions and export restrictions may continue to proliferate, leading to greater uncertainty in emerging and growth markets .\n We may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units or other intangible asset impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations . Credit agreements contain a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a maximum specified leverage ratio and place other limits on our business . If we are unable to satisfy this covenant, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders .\n Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results . Integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including corporate restructuring and coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, operations and operations . Foreign acquisitions involve unique risks, including those related to integration of operations across the company .\n We may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of, investments in, or alliances with, other companies and businesses . We face competition for acquisitions from other health care and non-health care acquirers, financial sponsors, and from the market for initial public offerings (IPOs) Some of our competitors in the medical device sector may have access to substantially greater amounts of cash than we do .\n The success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions, investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors . If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions, it may adversely impact our ability to grow our business . Any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing .\n The 2023 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $450 million to $550 million . A substantial portion of the savings will be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives, the company says . The plan builds on our Global Supply Chain Optimization strategy, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing and distribution network .\n The development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals . We cannot guarantee that the activities under our restructuring plans will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings . The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs .\n If we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted . There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance .\n Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties . In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand . We have also faced and may continue to face disruptions in the transportation of materials, components and our products within our global supply chains .\n Certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements . In certain cases, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner . Many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service .\n U.S. and international governments have or are considering adopting regulations on the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) The size and complexity of our IT systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption .\n Malicious actors may attempt to trick staff to disclose information to gain access to our systems . Power outages, natural disasters, inadequate or ineffective backups, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, vulnerabilities in third-party software or services, errors by our staff or service providers . We may also face operational interruptions as we continue to implement our new global enterprise resource planning (ERP), which began in 2022 .\n Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in complexity and scope, and inherently may be difficult to detect . Emerging technologies such as AI and quantum computing are evolving rapidly in their practicality and use for cyber-attacks including through enhanced social engineering . Failure by us to maintain our IT or OT systems, products and data integrity could result in outages or unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information .\n In Europe, the Data Protection Directive requires us to manage individually identifiable information in the EU, and the General Data Protection Regulation may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue . Some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers . Enforcement actions could be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business, including related to market approvals of products and technologies .\n The effects of global climate change present risks to our business . Natural disasters, extreme weather and other conditions caused by or related to climate change could adversely impact our supply chain . Increased environmental regulation, including to address climate change, may result in increases in compliance burdens and costs . The extent and severity of climate change impacts are unknown, and the scope of potential impact on our business may be difficult to predict .\n There is an increased focus from certain investors, customers, employees, regulators and other stakeholders globally concerning corporate social responsibility and sustainability matters . We may fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals . Such failures could be due to changes in our plans, such as carbon emissions and renewable energy goals .\n The loss of one or more key employees, our ability to attract or develop additional qualified employees or any delay in hiring key personnel could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations . A shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs . Political, economic and policy influences are leading the health care industry to make substantial structural and financial changes .\n We cannot predict the specific health care programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by various regional and national governments . We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products . In the EU, we are required to comply with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) effective May 2021 .\n In 2023, updates to the legislative text of the EU MDR were adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union . The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity . Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis .\n Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals . Certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data . There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis .\n FDA can take action against a company that promotes \"off-label\" uses . FDA can also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDC Act . Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations . International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA are subject to FDA export requirements .\n Some of the world's biggest problems could be caused by unexpected or unexpected events, such as the loss of approval of new products . The problems could include the failure of a new product to be approved by the U.S. government or the failure to provide adequate funding for new products to meet the needs of the public . The problem is that new products must be approved and approved before they are approved .\n The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities . We have received and in the future may receive, subpoenas and other requests for information from Congress and state and federal governmental agencies . An adverse outcome in any matter could include the commencement of an investigation, civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies .\n Management could divert attention of management from day-to-day operations of our business . Resolution of any matter could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations . Failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. We have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure, policies, systems and processes .\n Company is subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, tariffs, and duties in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions . Tax laws and regulations could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations .\n Many provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted in the U.S. in 2017 expire at the end of 2025 . Unless incentives and grants are extended, they will expire between 2026 and 2034 . The actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations .\n Many countries where we do business have already implemented the Pillar Two global minimum tax into their national laws . Other countries are considering enacting laws consistent with the rules, while others have yet to announce their intention to adopt . There is significant uncertainty that exists regarding the interpretation of the detailed Pillar Two rules, whether such rules will be implemented consistently across taxing jurisdictions, how such rules interact with existing national tax laws .\n The implementation of new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, China or other countries for an extended period could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . The medical device market in which we participate is largely technology driven. We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property, systems, software-based products or other sensitive data .\n A number of third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them . Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products . We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protec. oss product lines, technologies and geographies .\n We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending . We may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or know-how . No assurances can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents . The invalidation of key patents or a successful lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business .\n Our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses and unauthorized access to our data . If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations .\n The design, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims . Pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may divert the attention of our technical and management personnel . We may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us, if at all .\n The magnitude of potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity . The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify .\n Quired to register our establishments and list our devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA . Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review . In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain International Standards Organization ( ISO) certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies .\n CURITY's cybersecurity program is administered by a cross-functional team of cybersecurity professionals that includes employees and third party contractors and vendors . We have implemented cybersecurity policies mapped to industry and government standards and frameworks . We regularly review our cybersecurity policies and require annual cybersecurity training for employees . We also periodically conduct simulation exercises involving employees at various levels of the organization to prepare for cybersecurity incidents .\n We use penetration testing to simulate cyberattacks and better understand our exploitable weaknesses . We use third party security providers for specialized areas such as incident response, penetration testing, and on-demand cybersecurity services, including staff augmentation and consulting . We also leverage a managed security service provider to augment our cybersecurity organization and to provide additional monitoring and response capabilities .\n Cybersecurity related risks are included in the risk universe that the ERM function evaluates to assess top risks to the Company on an annual basis . The ERM program’s annual risk assessment is presented annually to our Board of Directors . There can be no assurance that we, or the third parties with which we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident in the future that may materially affect us ."
