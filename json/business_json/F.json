    "item1": "Item 1. Business”.\n(f)\nPurchase obligations under existing offtake agreements for certain battery raw materials are not included in the table above.  As of December 31, 2024, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately $1.8 billion of purchase obligations and approximately $4.9 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast.  However, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which may result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate.  The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase.  In the event that we do not expect to consume all of the materials we are obligated to purchase pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we may sell the excess materials back to the supplier or another party.  The resale price may or may not be the same as the original purchase price, depending on then-current market conditions and negotiated terms.  As a result, we have recorded, and may in the future record, accruals related to either the resale when the purchase price mechanism under our agreements is higher than the expected resale price of the excess materials or when we are required to otherwise compensate the supplier.  Accruals recorded to date for such items have been immaterial.  As market conditions dictate, we have entered, and may in the future enter, into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or renegotiate existing agreements.  For additional information, see the discussion of our offtake agreements below on page 62.\nWe plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements.\nChanges in Company Cash.  \nIn managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items.  Operating items include:  Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows).  Non-operating items include:  restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit).\n61\nItem 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nWith respect to “Changes in working capital,” in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced.  In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days.  As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due.  Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days.  For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow.  Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow.  For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid.  The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.\nIn response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles.  Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory.  Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of $6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC (“BOSK”) over a five-year period ending in 2026.  Through January 2025, we have recognized $2.4 billion of contributions to BOSK, net of returns of capital (for additional information, see Note 23 of the Notes to the Financial Statements).  Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities.  Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term.  \nThe terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time.  The purchase price mechanisms included in our offtake agreements are typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery.  The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output.  Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials or otherwise compensate the supplier in the amount determined by the contract.  Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in the first half of 2025. \n \nUnlike our standard arrangements with suppliers, under multi-year offtake agreements, the risks associated with lower-than-expected electric vehicle production volumes or changes in battery technology that reduce the need for certain raw materials are borne by Ford rather than our suppliers.  Accordingly, in the event we do not purchase the materials pursuant to the terms of these agreements, and we are unable to restructure an agreement or an alternate purchaser is unable to be found, Ford retains a financial obligation for those materials. \n \nFor additional discussion of the risks related to our offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts, see “",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES\nWe use both generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance.  The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results.  We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted.\n•\nCompany Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure:  Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford)\n – Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items.  This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results.  Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources.  Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows:\nPre-Tax Special Item\nSignificance Guideline\n∘  Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses\n∘  No minimum\n∘  Gains and losses on investments in equity securities\n∘  No minimum\n∘  Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix\n∘  Generally $100 million or more\n∘  Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities\n∘  $500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally $100 million or more for other items\nWhen we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities.\n•\nCompany Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure:  Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin)\n – Company adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue.  This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \n•\nAdjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure:  Earnings/(Loss) Per Share)\n – Measure of Company’s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests.  The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities.  When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \n•\nAdjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure:  Effective Tax Rate)\n – Measure of Company’s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items.  The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting.  When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \n75\nItem 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\n•\nCompany Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure:  Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) \n– Measure of Company’s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit’s operating cash flows.  The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives.  The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP.  This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management’s assessment of the Company’s operating cash flow performance.  When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities.\n•\nAdjusted ROIC\n – Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters.  Adjusted Return on Invested Capital (“Adjusted ROIC”) provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company’s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented.  Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs.  Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB liability.\n76\nItem 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:  (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above.  Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nWarranties and Field Service Actions\nNature of Estimates Required.\n  We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time and/or mileage, which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale.  Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns.  Software updates are increasingly a component of vehicle service and may be performed during warranty coverage repairs, through field service actions, or through over-the-air updates.  We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale.  In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance.\nAssumptions and Approach Used.\n  We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model.  We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.  We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis.  Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available.  With actual experience, we use the data to update the historical averages.  We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations.  Based on this data, we update our estimates as necessary.  \nField service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period.  We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model.  We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year.  We assess our obligation for field service actions on a regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary.\nDue to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.  See Note 24 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \nNature of Estimates Required.\n  The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we utilize the calculated present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration valuation assumptions specific to each plan.  Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions.  No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).\n83\nItem 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nAssumptions and Approach Used.\n  The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors:\n•\nDiscount rates.\n  Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses, which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan.  Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the year-end obligations.  \n•\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n  Our expected long-term rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan.  Historical returns also are considered when appropriate.  The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences.  \n•\nSalary growth.\n  Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation.\n•\nInflation.\n  Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets.\n•\nExpected contributions.  \nOur expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency).\n•\nRetirement rates.  \nRetirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience.\n•\nMortality rates.  \nMortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience.\n•\nHealth care cost trends\n.  Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. \nAssumptions are set at each year-end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event, such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement.\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions.\nPension Plans\nEffect of Actual Results\n.  The year-end 2024 weighted average discount rate was 5.65% for U.S. plans and 4.51% for non-U.S. plans, reflecting increases of 48 and 53 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2023.  Higher discount rates lowered the valuations of U.S. and non-U.S. plans.  In 2024, the U.S. actual return on assets was 0.08%, which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 5.93%.  Non-U.S. actual return on assets was 2.77%, which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 4.53%.  The lower returns are explained primarily by lower returns on fixed income assets given the increase in long-term interest rates.  In total, higher discount rates, partially offset by asset returns lower than our assumptions, resulted in a net remeasurement gain of $575 million.  This gain has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item.\nFor 2025, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 6.37% for U.S. plans, up 44 basis points from 2024, and 5.23% for non-U.S. plans, up 70 basis points compared with a year ago, reflecting higher expected capital market return assumptions, including increased long-term interest rates. \nDe-risking Strategy\n.  We employ a broad de-risking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves.  Changes in interest rates, which directly influence changes in discount rates, in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio.  Our de-risking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates.  Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio.\n84\nItem 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nSensitivity Analysis.  \nThe December 31, 2024 pension funded status and 2025 expense are affected by year-end 2024 assumptions.  Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted.  The effects of changes in the factors that generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below.\nDiscount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets.  The table below estimates the effect on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions):  \nBasis \nPoint Change\nIncrease/(Decrease) in\nDecember 31, 2024 Funded Status\nFactor\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\nDiscount rate - obligation\n+/- 100 bps\n$2,500/$(3,000)\n$2,300/$(2,800)\nInterest rate - fixed income assets\n+/- 100\n(2,400)/2,800\n(1,700)/2,100\nNet impact on funded status\n$100/$(200)\n$600/$(700)\nThe fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., changes in credit spreads, bond coupon and active management excess returns), and growth asset returns.  Other factors that affect net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected.\nInterest rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest effect on pension expense.  These assumptions are generally set at each year-end for expense recorded throughout the following year.  The table below estimates the effect on pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions):\nBasis \nPoint Change\nIncrease/(Decrease) in\n2025 Pension Expense\nFactor\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\nInterest rate - service cost and interest cost\n+/- 25 bps\n$25/$(25)\n$15/$(15)\nExpected long-term rate of return on assets\n+/- 25\n(70)/70\n(50)/50\nThe effect of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities.  The sensitivity of pension expense to a change in discount rate assumptions may not be linear. \nOther Postretirement Employee Benefits\nEffect of Actual Results\n.  The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide OPEB plans at December 31, 2024 was 5.46%, compared with 5.10% at December 31, 2023, resulting in a worldwide net remeasurement gain of $112 million, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item.\nSensitivity Analysis.  \nDiscount rates and interest rates have the largest effect on our OPEB obligation and expense.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nNature of Estimates Required.  \nWe must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes.  We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas:  (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax reporting and financial statement purposes, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.  Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.\nAssumptions and Approach Used.  \nWe are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate.  These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation.  We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions.  If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized.  This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes.  We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities.  Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred.\nWe must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.\nThis assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account various types of evidence, including the following:\n•\nNature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses.\n  A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence.  We generally consider cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability.  We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors.  In certain circumstances, historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations; \n•\nSources of future taxable income.\n  Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence.  Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated.  Otherwise, these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years, particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved.  In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment; and\n•\nTax planning strategies.\n  If necessary and available, tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards.  These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and, depending on their nature, could be heavily weighted.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits.  We presently believe that global valuation allowances of $3.9 billion are required and that we ultimately will recover the remaining $15.3 billion of deferred tax assets.  However, realization of our deferred tax assets is impacted by a number of variables, including future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions, tax law changes, and tax planning and the related effects on our cash and liquidity position.  Accordingly, our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in future periods.\nFor additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n86\nItem 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nAsset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets.  Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting.  Our asset groups for 2024 were:  Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit, and Ford Next.\nNature of Estimates Required - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. \n We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable.  Events that trigger a test for recoverability include:\n•\nMaterial adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present negative cash flows combined with a history of negative cash flows and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses\n•\nAdverse change in legal factors or significant negative industry or regulatory trends (such as overcrowding of market offerings or changes in regulations, resulting in excess capacity relative to market demand)\n•\nCurrent expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life\n•\nSignificant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition\n•\nSignificant change in the asset grouping\nIn addition, investing in new or emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront capital, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term.  In these instances, near-term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment.  In such circumstances, we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan.  If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed.  \nWhen a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group.  If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group’s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method.  To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that may have been prepared for other business purposes.  An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.  When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life.\nNature of Estimates Required - Held-for-Sale Operations.  \nWe perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be discontinued, held for sale, or otherwise disposed of when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year.  We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received, less cost to sell, and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group.  An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.  We also assess fair value if circumstances arise that were considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell a disposal group previously classified as held for sale upon reclassification to held and used.  When there is a change to a plan of sale, and the assets are reclassified from held for sale to held and used, the long-lived assets are reported at the lower of (i) the carrying amount before a held-for-sale designation, adjusted for depreciation that would have been recognized if the assets had not been classified as held for sale, or (ii) the fair value at the date the assets no longer satisfy the criteria for classification as held for sale.\nAssumptions and Approach Used - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets.\n  The fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a market participant.  Considerations include appropriate discount rates, valuation techniques, the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group.\n87\nItem 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nWe measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party) when available.  When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach.  The income approach uses cash flow projections.  Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value.  We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data.  Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. \nChanges in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and, therefore, can affect the test results.  The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections:\n•\nBusiness projections.  \nWe make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace.  These\nassumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix, and pricing.  We also make assumptions about our cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance).  These projections are derived using our internal business plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors.\n•\nLong-term growth rate.  \nA growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-free interim cash flows.  The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group’s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period.\n•\nDiscount rate.  \nWhen measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use.  Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.\n•\nEconomic projections.  \nAssumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles.  These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, industry sales volumes, inflation, interest rates, prices of raw materials (e.g., commodities), and foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of an asset group.  This approach relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business as the asset group being evaluated.  In addition, to the extent available, we also consider third-party valuations that may have been prepared for other business purposes.\nDuring 2024, no triggering events were identified.  \nAssumptions and Approach Used - Held-for-sale Operations.\n  In the first quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell 100% of our equity interest in Ford Sales and Service Korea Company (“FSSK”), and the assets and liabilities of the entity were classified as held for sale.  However, as of December 31, 2024, FSSK no longer met the held-for-sale criteria as that sale transaction did not close and is no longer probable of occurring.  Accordingly, FSSK’s assets and liabilities were reclassified and reported as held and used as of December 31, 2024.  In the third quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell 100% of our equity interest in Ford Motor Company A/S, our national sales company in Denmark.  The entity was classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2024 once all held-for-sale criteria were met.  Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, the assets and liabilities of Ford Motor Company A/S were reported as held for sale.  We determined that the assets of both FSSK and Ford Motor Company A/S, which were not material, were not impaired.  See Note 21 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding held-for-sale operations.\n88\nItem 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit’s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date.  The adequacy of Ford Credit’s allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly, and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly.  Because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain.  Changes in assumptions affect \nFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses\n on our consolidated income statements and the allowance for credit losses contained within \nFord Credit finance receivables, net\n on our consolidated balance sheets.  See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses.\nNature of Estimates Required.\n  Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment.  The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses, recent portfolio performance, and forward-looking macroeconomic conditions.  The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables, wholesale loans, and dealer loans.  If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors, including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.\nAssumptions Used.  \nFord Credit’s allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding:\n•\nProbability of default\n.  The expected probability of payment and time to default, which include assumptions about macroeconomic factors and recent performance.\n•\nLoss given default.\n  The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable.  The loss given default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries.\nMacroeconomic factors used in Ford Credit’s models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment rates, personal bankruptcy filings, housing prices, and gross domestic product.\nSensitivity Analysis.  \nChanges in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance for credit losses.  The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit’s U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail financing portfolio at December 31, 2024 is as follows (in millions):\nAssumption\nBasis Point Change\nIncrease/(Decrease) in Allowance for Credit Losses\nProbability of default (lifetime)\n+/- 100 bps\n$250/$(250)\nLoss given default\n+/- 100\n15/(15)\nAccumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases\nAccumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credit’s operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term.\nFord Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis.  If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit’s revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term.  Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis.\nGenerally, lease customers have the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer.\n89\nItem 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNature of Estimates Required. \n Each operating lease in Ford Credit’s portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer.  At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle.  Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for Ford Credit’s leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data and benchmarks to third-party data depending on availability.  Similar factors are considered in the third-party data Ford Credit uses to revise its estimate of the expected residual value during the lease term.\nAssumptions Used.  \nFord Credit’s accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding:\n•\nAuction value.\n  Ford Credit’s projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and\n•\nReturn volume.\n  Ford Credit’s projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end.\nSee Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases.\nSensitivity Analysis.  \nFor returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle.  The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases; however, the impact may be tempered or exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract.  A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credit’s estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract.  The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit’s U.S. Ford and Lincoln brand operating lease portfolio at December 31, 2024 is as follows (in millions):\nAssumption\nBasis Point\nChange\nIncrease/(Decrease) in Projected Lifetime Depreciation\nFuture auction values\n+/- 100 bps\n$(50)/$50\nReturn volumes\n+/- 100\n5/(5)\nAdjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance sheets as \nNet investment in operating leases \nand on our income statements in \nFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED\nFor a discussion of recent accounting standards, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n90\nITEM 7A. \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOVERVIEW\nWe are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks.\nWe monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee, the Global Risk Management Committee (“GRMC”).  The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and the committee includes our Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer.\nWe are exposed to liquidity risk, including the possibility of having to curtail business or being unable to meet financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable.  Our plan is to maintain funding sources to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles.  As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include unsecured debt issuances, sales of receivables in securitization transactions and other structured financings, equity and equity-linked issuances, and bank borrowings.\nWe are exposed to a variety of other risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury.  We protect against these risks through the purchase of commercial insurance that is designed to protect us above our self-insured retentions against events that could generate significant losses.\nDirect responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurer’s Office and is governed by written policies and procedures.  Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows.  Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective.  In addition, our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are approved by the GRMC and reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nIn accordance with our corporate risk management policies, we use derivative instruments, when available, such as forward contracts, swaps, and options that economically hedge certain exposures (foreign currency, commodity, and interest rates).  We do not use derivative contracts for trading, market-making, or speculative purposes.  In certain instances, we forgo hedge accounting, and in certain other instances, our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.  Either situation results in unrealized gains and losses that are recognized in income.  For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nThe market and counterparty risks of the Company excluding Ford Credit as well as our Ford Credit segment are discussed and quantified below.\nCOMPANY EXCLUDING FORD CREDIT MARKET RISK\nWe frequently have expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the following:  purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and investments in foreign operations.  These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates.  We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in the production of our vehicles and changes in interest rates. \nForeign currency risk, commodity risk, and interest rate risk are measured and quantified using a model to evaluate the sensitivity of market value to instantaneous, parallel shifts in rates and/or prices.  \nForeign Currency Risk.\n  Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in currency exchange rates.  Accordingly, our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenues and costs, assets, liabilities, and firm commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies consistent with our overall risk management strategy.  In our hedging actions, we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts).  The extent to which we hedge is also impacted by materiality of the risk in the context of our overall portfolio, market liquidity, and/or our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting.\n91\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) \nThe net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of December 31, 2024 was an asset of $410 million, compared with a liability of $319 million as of December 31, 2023.  The potential change in the fair value from a 10% change in the underlying exchange rates, in U.S. dollar terms, would have been $2.9 billion at December 31, 2024, compared with $3.1 billion at December 31, 2023.  The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes foreign exchange rate changes are instantaneous and adverse across all currencies.  In reality, some of our exposures offset and foreign exchange rates move in different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure.  See Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contracts.  \nCommodity Price Risk.  \nCommodity price risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in the prices of commodities used in the production of motor vehicles, such as base metals (e.g., steel, copper, and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene).  As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on battery raw materials (e.g., lithium, cobalt, and nickel).  \nOur practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchases of certain commodities consistent with our overall risk management strategy.  In our hedging actions, we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts).  The extent to which we hedge is also impacted by materiality of the risk in the context of our overall portfolio, market liquidity, and/or our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting.\nThe net fair value of commodity forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of December 31, 2024 was a liability of $8 million, compared with a liability of $9 million as of December 31, 2023.  The potential change in the fair value from a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices would have been $189 million at December 31, 2024, compared with $203 million at December 31, 2023.  The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes commodity price changes are instantaneous and adverse across all commodities.  In reality, commodity prices move in different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure.\nIn addition, our purchasing organization (with guidance from the GRMC, as appropriate) negotiates contracts for the continuous supply of raw materials.  In some cases, these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific prices, and, therefore, play a role in managing commodity price risk.\nInterest Rate Risk.  \nInterest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our Company cash investment portfolios due to a change in interest rates.  Our interest rate sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolios includes cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities.  At December 31, 2024, we had Company cash of $28.5 billion in our investment portfolios, compared to $28.8 billion at December 31, 2023.  We invest the portfolios in securities of various types and maturities, the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates.  The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short-term investments.  In investing the cash in our investment portfolios, safety of principal is the primary objective and risk-adjusted return is the secondary objective.\nAt any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolios.  Assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our portfolios would be reduced by $233 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2024.  This compares to $222 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2023.  While these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected.  The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve.  In reality, interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel.\n92\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) \nFORD CREDIT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk for Ford Credit is the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates will adversely affect cash flow and economic value.  \nInterest Rate Risk\n.  Generally, Ford Credit’s assets and the related debt have different re-pricing periods, and consequently, respond differently to changes in interest rates.\nFord Credit’s assets consist primarily of fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts and floating-rate wholesale receivables.  Fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract.  Wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicles held in dealers’ inventory and generally require dealers to pay a floating rate.\nDebt consists primarily of short- and long-term unsecured and securitized debt.  Ford Credit’s term debt instruments are principally fixed-rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity.\nFord Credit’s interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows and volatility in its economic value from changes in interest rates based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market.  Ford Credit uses economic value sensitivity analysis and re-pricing gap analysis to evaluate potential long-term effects of changes in interest rates.  It then enters into interest rate swaps to convert portions of its floating-rate debt to fixed or its fixed-rate debt to floating to ensure that Ford Credit’s exposure falls within the established tolerances.  Ford Credit also uses pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of near-term cash flow exposure.  The pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis measures the changes in expected cash flows associated with Ford Credit’s interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments from hypothetical changes in interest rates over a twelve-month horizon.  Interest rate swaps are placed to maintain exposure within approved thresholds and the Asset-Liability Committee reviews the re-pricing mismatch monthly. \nTo provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre-tax cash flow to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities (a “parallel shift”), as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels.  In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credit’s analysis.  As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent Ford Credit’s view of future interest rate movements.\nUnder these interest rate scenarios, Ford Credit expects more assets than debt and liabilities to re-price in the next twelve months.  Other things being equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest received on Ford Credit’s assets will increase more than the interest paid on Ford Credit’s debt, thereby initially increasing Ford Credit’s pre-tax cash flow.  During a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credit would expect its pre-tax cash flow to initially decrease.  Ford Credit’s pre-tax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement at December 31 was as follows (in millions):\nPre-Tax Cash Flow Sensitivity\n2023\n2024\nOne percentage point instantaneous \nincrease\n in interest rates\n$\n78 \n$\n107 \nOne percentage point instantaneous \ndecrease\n in interest rates\n(78)\n(107)\nWhile the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credit’s best estimate of the impacts of the specified assumed interest rate scenarios, its actual results could differ from those projected.  The model Ford Credit uses to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions.  Embedded in the model are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives, exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives, and predicted repayment of retail financing and operating lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity.  Ford Credit’s repayment projections ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience.  If interest rates or other factors change, Ford Credit’s actual prepayment experience could be different than projected.\n93\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) \nForeign Currency Risk.  \nFord Credit’s policy is to minimize exposure to changes in currency exchange rates.  To meet funding objectives, Ford Credit borrows in a variety of currencies, principally U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, sterling, and renminbi.  Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables.  When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements.  When a different currency is used, Ford Credit may use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables.  As a result of this policy, Ford Credit believes its market risk exposure, relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2024, is insignificant.\nDerivative Fair Values. \n The net fair value of Ford Credit’s derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2024 was a liability of $1.2 billion, compared to a liability of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023.\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK\nCounterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract.  We enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk.  Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and commodity price risk.  We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification. \nOur approach to managing counterparty risk is forward-looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions before risks become losses.  Exposure limits are established based on our overall risk tolerance, which is calculated from counterparty credit ratings and market-based credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads.  The exposure limits are lower for smaller and lower-rated counterparties, counterparties that have relatively higher CDS spreads, and for longer dated exposures.  Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and included in periodic reports to our Treasurer.\nSubstantially all of our counterparty exposures are with counterparties that have an investment grade rating.  Investment grade is our guideline for minimum counterparty long-term ratings.\nITEM 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, our Financial Statements, the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements, and the Financial Statement Schedule that are filed as part of this Report are listed under “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” and are set forth beginning on page \n105\n immediately following the signature pages of this Report.\nITEM 9.\n Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\n94\nITEM 9A. \nControls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  \nJames D. Farley, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and John T. Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), have performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), as of December 31, 2024, and each has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  \nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f).  The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.  The assessment was based on criteria established in the framework \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n (PCAOB ID \n238\n), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  \nThere were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nITEM 9B.  \nOther Information.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company \nadopted\n, modified, or \nterminated\n a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, except as follows:\nAndrew Frick\n, \nPresident, Ford Blue and Ford Customer Service Division\n, \nadopted\n a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement on \nDecember 24, 2024\n that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

Fortt\nAttorney-in-Fact\n104\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Ford Motor Company\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ford Motor Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the COSO. \nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.   \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n105\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nFord Credit Consumer Finance Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses\nAs described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had consumer finance receivables of $83,218 million, for which a consumer allowance for credit losses of $860 million was recorded as of December 31, 2024.  The consumer allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the consumer finance receivables as of the balance sheet date.  For consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics, management estimates the lifetime expected credit losses based on a collective assessment using measurement models and management judgment.  The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumptions to monthly expected exposures, then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivable’s original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable.  If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Ford Credit consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the probability of default and loss given default assumptions and management’s judgment regarding qualitative factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s determination of the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses.  These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the models used to determine the allowance; (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the probability of default and loss given default assumptions; (iv) testing the data used in the models; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgment regarding qualitative factors related to economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in performing the procedures described in (i) through (v).\n106\nWarranty and Field Service Actions Accrual (United States)\nAs described in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accrual for estimated future warranty and field service action costs, net of estimated supplier recoveries (“warranty accrual”), of $14,032 million as of December 31, 2024, of which the United States comprises a significant portion.  Management accrues the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale.  Management establishes their estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.  Management establishes their estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year.  Management reevaluates the adequacy of their accruals on a regular basis.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the warranty accrual for the United States is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in the estimation of the accrual and development of the patterned estimation model; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the estimation model and significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of claims; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to the estimate of the warranty accrual for the United States.  These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management to develop the warranty accrual for the United States, related to the frequency and average cost of claims, in part by considering the historical experience of the Company.  Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the model as well as the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of claims.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nDetroit, Michigan\nFebruary 5, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1946.\n107\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND

We reclassified certain prior year amounts in our consolidated financial statements to conform to the current\nyear presentation.\n \nCertain Transactions with Ford Credit\nTransactions between Ford Credit and our other segments occur in the ordinary course of business.  \nAdditional detail regarding certain of those transactions is below (in billions):\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nBalance Sheet\nTrade and other receivables (a)\n$\n9.2\n \n$\n8.2\n \nUnearned interest supplements and residual support (b)\n(\n4.6\n)\n(\n6.5\n)\nOther (c)\n1.6\n \n2.2\n \n__________\n(a)\nFord Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro receivables (generated primarily from vehicle and parts sales to third parties) sold to Ford Credit.  \n(b)\nFord Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro pay amounts to Ford Credit at the point of retail financing or lease origination, which represent interest supplements and residual support.\n(c)\nIncludes a sale-leaseback agreement between Ford Blue and Ford Credit relating primarily to vehicles that we lease to our employees.\n \nSee Note 2 for additional information regarding our finance and lease incentives between Ford Credit and our other segments.\nNOTE 2.  \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nFor each accounting topic that is addressed in its own note, the description of the accounting policy may be found in the related note.  Other significant accounting policies are described below.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results.  Estimates are used to account for certain items such as marketing accruals, warranty costs, employee benefit programs, allowance for credit losses, and other items requiring judgment.  Estimates are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ.\nForeign Currency\nWhen an entity has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from its functional currency, each reporting period, we remeasure those assets and liabilities from the transactional currency to the entity’s functional currency.  The effect of this remeasurement process and the results of our related foreign currency hedging activities are reported in \nCost of sales \nand\n Other income/(loss), net\n and were $\n180\n million, $\n13\n million, and $(\n155\n) million for the years ended 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nGenerally, our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency.  We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars using end-of-period exchange rates.  Changes in the carrying value of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates are recognized in\n Foreign currency translation\n, a component of \nOther comprehensive income/(Ioss), net of tax.\n  Upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, the amount of accumulated foreign currency translation related to the entity is reclassified to income and recognized as part of the gain or loss on the investment.\n113\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n(Continued)\nCash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents\n are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on withdrawal.  A debt security is classified as a cash equivalent if it meets these criteria and if it has a remaining time to maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.  Amounts on deposit and available upon demand, or negotiated to provide for daily liquidity without penalty, are classified as \nCash and cash equivalents\n.  Time deposits, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts that meet the above criteria are reported at par value on our consolidated balance sheets.\n \nRestricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are recorded in \nOther assets \nin the non-current assets section of our consolidated balance\n \nsheets.  Our Company excluding Ford Credit restricted cash balances primarily include various escrow agreements related to legal, insurance, customs, and environmental matters and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements.  Our Ford Credit segment restricted cash balances primarily include cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory\n \nreserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements.  Restricted cash does not include required minimum balances or cash securing debt issued through securitization transactions.\nMarketable Securities\nInvestments in debt securities with a maturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase and other debt securities for which there is more than an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on withdrawal are classified and accounted for as either trading or available-for-sale marketable securities.  Equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are classified and accounted for as trading marketable securities.\nRealized gains and losses, interest income, and dividend income on all of our marketable securities and unrealized gains and losses on securities not classified as available for sale are recorded in \nOther income/(loss), net\n.  Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized in \nUnrealized gains and losses on securities\n, a component of \nOther comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax\n.  Realized gains and losses and reclassifications of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income are measured using the specific identification method.\nOn a quarterly basis, we review our available-for-sale debt securities for credit losses.  We compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security.  If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, we determine if a credit loss allowance is necessary.  If a credit loss allowance is necessary, we will record an allowance, limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, and recognize the corresponding charge in \nOther income/(loss), net\n.  Factors we consider include the severity and reason for the decline in value, interest rate changes, and counterparty long-term ratings.\nTrade, Notes, and Other Receivables\nTrade, notes, and other receivables consist primarily of receivables from contracts with customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories.  The current portion of trade and notes receivables is reported in \nTrade and other receivables, net\n.  The non-current portion of notes receivables is reported in \nOther assets\n.  Trade receivables are typically outstanding for \n30\n days or less, are recorded at their contractual value and do not bear interest.  Notes receivable are recorded at their amortized cost using the effective interest method.  \nEach reporting period, we evaluate the collectibility of the trade and notes receivables and record an allowance for credit losses representing our estimate of the expected losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the receivables.  Additions to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to bad debt expense reported in \nSelling, administrative, and other expenses \nand\n Cost of sales\n.  Trade and notes receivables are written off against the allowance for credit losses when the account is deemed to be uncollectible.\n \nThe carrying value of trade, notes, and other receivables was $\n16.4\n billion and $\n15.7\n billion at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  The credit loss reserve included in the carrying value of trade, notes, and other receivables was $\n86\n million and $\n113\n million at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n114\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n(Continued)\nSupplier Finance Programs\nFinancial institutions participate in a supply chain finance (“SCF”) program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide.  Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity.  We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it.  SCF obligations are reported in \nPayables\n.  \nThe rollforward of SCF obligations for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in millions):\n2023\n2024\nOutstanding at the beginning of the year\n$\n253\n \n$\n220\n \nInvoices received during the year\n1,778\n \n1,522\n \nInvoices settled during the year\n(\n1,811\n)\n(\n1,570\n)\nOutstanding at the end of the year\n$\n220\n \n$\n172\n \nNet Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired.  Goodwill impairment testing is also performed following an allocation of goodwill to a business to be disposed or a change in reporting units.  We test for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit allocated the goodwill is less than its carrying amount.  If the qualitative assessment indicates a possible impairment, the carrying value of the asset or reporting unit is compared with its fair value.  Fair value is measured relying primarily on the income approach by applying a discounted cash flow method, the market approach using market values or multiples, and/or third-party valuations.\n \n \nWe capitalize and amortize our finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.\n \nThe carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill is reported in \nOther assets\n in the non-current assets section of our consolidated balance sheets.\n  Intangible assets are comprised primarily of advertising agreements and land rights\n.  The net carrying amount of our intangible assets was $\n80\n million and $\n69\n million at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  The net carrying amount of goodwill was $\n683\n million and $\n658\n million at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  For the periods presented, we did \nnot\n record any material impairments for indefinite-lived intangibles or goodwill.\nRegulatory Compliance Credits\nWhen we are not able to meet regulatory compliance requirements through the sales mix of our products, compliance credits may be purchased and/or, in some cases, fines or penalties may be paid.  Compliance credits are recorded as \nOther assets\n upon delivery.  Once an asset is recorded, it must be monitored for recoverability at least quarterly.\nWhen it is probable and estimable that the mix of vehicles sold will not meet regulatory compliance requirements and will result in a compliance shortfall during the compliance period (e.g., model year, calendar year), we recognize a liability and related expense.  The liability reflects an estimate of the cost of compliance credits and/or fines expected to be incurred to settle a compliance shortfall.\nThe asset and liability remain on our balance sheet until final certification from the applicable governmental regulatory agency is received.\n115\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n(Continued)\nHeld-and-Used Long-Lived Asset Impairment\nWe test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable.  Events that trigger a test for recoverability include:\n•\nMaterial adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present negative cash flows combined with a history of negative cash flows and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses\n•\nAdverse change in legal factors or significant negative industry, or regulatory trends (such as overcrowding of market offerings or changes in regulations, resulting in excess capacity relative to market demand)\n•\nCurrent expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life\n•\nSignificant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition \n•\nSignificant change in the asset grouping  \nIn addition, investing in new or emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront capital, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term.  In these instances, near term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment.  In such circumstances, we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan.  If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed. \nWhen a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group.  If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group’s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method.  To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that may have been prepared for other business purposes.  An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.  When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life.\n  For the periods presented, we have \nnot\n recorded any material impairments.\nHeld-for-Sale Asset Impairment\nWe perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be discontinued, held for sale (“HFS”), or otherwise disposed of when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year.  We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received, less cost to sell, and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group.  An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value (see Note 21).  We also assess fair value if circumstances arise that were considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell a disposal group previously classified as HFS upon reclassification to held and used.  When there is a change to a plan of sale, and the assets are reclassified from HFS to held and used, the long-lived assets are reported at the lower of (i) the carrying amount before an HFS designation, adjusted for depreciation that would have been recognized if the assets had not been classified as HFS, or (ii) the fair value at the date the assets no longer satisfy the criteria for classification as HFS.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe measure fair value of our financial instruments, including those held within our pension plans, using various valuation methods and prioritize the use of observable inputs.  The use of observable and unobservable inputs and their significance in measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy:\n•\nLevel 1 - inputs include quoted prices for identical instruments and are the most observable\n•\nLevel 2 - inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments and observable inputs such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, and yield curves\n•\nLevel 3 - inputs include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the instruments\n116\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n(Continued)\nFixed income securities, equities, commingled funds, derivative financial instruments, and alternative assets are remeasured and presented within our consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis.  Finance receivables and debt are measured at fair value for the purpose of disclosure.  Other assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nTransfers into and transfers out of the hierarchy levels are recognized as if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period. \nValuation Method\nFixed Income Securities\n.  Fixed income securities primarily include government securities, government agency securities, corporate bonds, and asset-backed securities.  We generally measure fair value using prices obtained from pricing services or quotes from dealers that make markets in such securities.  Pricing methods and inputs to valuation models used by the pricing services depend on the security type (i.e., asset class).  Where possible, fair values are generated using market inputs, including quoted prices (the closing price in an exchange market), bid prices (the price at which a buyer stands ready to purchase), and other market information.  For fixed income securities that are not actively traded, the pricing services use alternative methods to determine fair value for the securities, including quotes for similar fixed income securities, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow using benchmark curves, or other factors.  In certain cases, when market data are not available, we may use broker quotes or pricing services that use proprietary pricing models to determine fair value.  The proprietary models incorporate unobservable inputs primarily consisting of prepayment curves, discount rates, default assumptions, recovery rates, yield assumptions, and credit spread assumptions.\nAn annual review is performed on the security prices received from our pricing services, which includes discussion and analysis of the inputs used by the pricing services to value our securities.  We also compare the price of certain securities sold close to the quarter end to the price of the same security at the balance sheet date to ensure the reported fair value is reasonable.  \nEquities.  \nEquity securities are primarily exchange-traded and are valued based on the closing bid, official close, or last trade pricing on an active exchange.  If closing prices are not available, securities are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price.  Securities that are thinly traded or delisted are valued using unobservable pricing data.\nCommingled Funds.  \nFixed income and public equity securities may each be combined into commingled fund investments.  Most commingled funds are valued to reflect our interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value (“NAV”).\nDerivative Financial Instruments.  \nExchange-traded derivatives for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded.  Over-the-counter derivatives are not exchange traded and are valued using independent pricing services or industry-standard valuation models such as a discounted cash flow.  When discounted cash flow models are used, projected future cash flows are discounted to a present value using market-based expectations for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and the contractual terms of the derivative instruments.  The discount rate used is the relevant benchmark interest rate (e.g., SOFR, SONIA) plus an adjustment for non-performance risk.  The adjustment reflects the full credit default swap (“CDS”) spread applied to a net exposure, by counterparty, considering the master netting agreements we have entered into and any posted collateral.  We use our \ncounterparty’s CDS spread when we are in a net asset position and our own CDS spread when we are in a net liability position.  In cases when market data are not available, we use broker quotes and models (e.g., Black-Scholes) to determine fair value.  This includes situations where there is a lack of liquidity for a particular currency or commodity, or when the instrument is longer dated.  When broker quotes or models are used to determine fair value, the derivative is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy.  All other derivatives are categorized within Level 2.  \nAlternative Assets.\n \n \nHedge funds generally hold liquid and readily-priced securities, such as public equities, exchange-traded derivatives, and corporate bonds.  Private equity and real estate investments are less liquid.  External investment managers typically report valuations reflecting initial cost or updated appraisals, which are adjusted for cash flows, and realized and unrealized gains/losses.  All alternative assets are valued at the NAV provided by the investment sponsor or third party administrator, as they do not have readily-available market quotations.  Valuations may lag up to \nsix months.  The NAV will be adjusted for cash flows (additional investments or contributions, and distributions) through year end.  We may make further adjustments for any known substantive valuation changes not reflected in the NAV.\n117\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n(Continued)\nWe may hold annuity contracts within some of our non-U.S. pension plans (see Note 16).  The contract valuation method is applied for markets where we have purchased annuity contracts from an insurer as a plan asset.  We measure the fair value of the insurance asset by projecting expected future cash flows from the contract and discounting them to present value based on current market rates.  The assumptions used to project expected future cash flows are based on actuarial estimates.  We include all annuity contracts within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nFinance Receivables.  \nWe measure finance receivables at fair value using internal valuation models (see Note 10).  These models project future cash flows of financing contracts based on scheduled contract payments (including principal and interest) and assumptions regarding expected credit losses and pre-payment speed.  The projected cash flows are discounted to present value at current rates that incorporate present yield curve and credit spread assumptions.  The fair value of finance receivables is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nOn a nonrecurring basis, we also measure at fair value retail contracts \n120\n days past due or deemed to be uncollectible, and individual dealer loans probable of foreclosure.  We use the fair value of collateral, adjusted for estimated costs to sell, to determine the fair value of these receivables.  The collateral for a retail financing or wholesale receivable is the vehicle financed, and for dealer loans is real estate or other property.  \nThe fair value of collateral for retail receivables is calculated as the outstanding receivable balances multiplied by the average recovery value percentage.  The fair value of collateral for wholesale receivables is based on the wholesale market value or liquidation value for new and used vehicles.  The fair value of collateral for dealer loans is determined by reviewing various appraisals, which include total adjusted appraised value of land and improvements, alternate use appraised value, broker’s opinion of value, and purchase offers.  \nDebt.  \nWe measure debt at fair value using quoted prices for our own debt with approximately the same remaining maturities (see Note 18).  Where quoted prices are not available, we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows and market-based expectations for interest rates, credit risk, and the contractual terms of the debt instruments.  For certain short-term debt with an original maturity date of one year or less, we assume that book value is a reasonable approximation of the debt’s fair value.  The fair value of debt is categorized within Level 2 of the hierarchy.\nFinance and Lease Incentives\nWe routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers’ customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit.  The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration when the vehicle is sold to the dealer.  Ford Credit records a reduction to the finance receivable or reduces the cost of the \nvehicle operating lease when it records the underlying finance contract, and we transfer to Ford Credit the amount of the incentive on behalf of the dealer’s customer.  See Note 1 for additional information regarding transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments.\n  The Ford Credit segment recognized interest revenue of $\n2.1\n billion, $\n2.3\n billion, and $\n2.9\n billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, and lower depreciation of $\n1.2\n billion, $\n0.9\n billion, and $\n1.0\n billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, associated with these incentives.  \nSupplier Price Adjustments\nWe frequently negotiate price adjustments with our suppliers throughout a production cycle, even after receiving production material.  These price adjustments relate to changes in design specification or other commercial terms such as economics, productivity, and competitive pricing.  We recognize price adjustments when we reach final agreement with our suppliers.  In general, we avoid direct price changes in consideration of future business; however, when these occur, our policy is to defer the recognition of any such price change given explicitly in consideration of future business.\nGovernment Incentives\nWe receive incentives from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities in the form of tax rebates or credits, grants, and loans.  Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense or as other income.  The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met and there is reasonable assurance of receipt.  Government incentives related to capital investment are recognized in \nNet Property\n as a reduction to the net book value of the related asset.  The incentives are recognized over the life of the asset as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense.\n118\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n(Continued)\nDuring 2022, we were awarded incentives by the State of Tennessee related to land, capital, and property tax abatements in connection with Ford’s capital investment in our new electric vehicle assembly plant and job commitments.  These incentives are available until December 2051.  The fair value of the land received in 2022 was $\n144\n million and was recorded in \nNet Property\n fully offset by the value of the incentive.   A capital grant of $\n285\n million was received in 2023 and will be recognized as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the life of the related assets.   \nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 incentivizes companies to engage in a wide range of activities primarily focused on clean energy investments and domestic manufacturing.  We are eligible for production credits related to advanced manufacturing of certain battery components.  These credits are recognized when an eligible component is produced in the United States and sold to a third party.  We recognized $\n105\n million as a reduction to \nCost of sales\n during the year ended December 31, 2024 related to production tax credits.\nFord may also indirectly benefit from incentives and grants awarded to companies with which we are affiliated but are not included in our consolidated financial statements. \nFord’s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or claw back.  Claw back provisions are monitored for ongoing compliance and are accrued for when losses are deemed probable and estimable (see Note 24).    \nSelected Other Costs\nEngineering, research, and development expenses are primarily reported in \nCost of sales\n and consist of salaries, materials, and associated costs.  Engineering, research, and development costs are expensed as incurred when performed internally or when performed by a supplier if we guarantee reimbursement.\n \nAdvertising costs are reported in \nSelling, administrative, and other expenses\n and are expensed as incurred.\n \nEngineering, research, development, and advertising expenses for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in billions):\n \n2022\n2023\n2024\nEngineering, research, and development\n$\n7.8\n \n$\n8.2\n \n$\n8.0\n \nAdvertising\n2.2\n \n2.5\n \n2.8\n \n119\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3.  \nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n.  We adopted the new standard and applied the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.  The standard requires disclosure of any significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (”CODM”) for each reportable segment.  In addition, the standard requires disclosure of an amount for “other segment items” by reportable segment and a description of its composition.  The standard also requires all annual disclosures about a reporting segment’s profit or loss and assets to be provided on an interim basis, beginning in 2025.  Adoption of the new standard did not impact our consolidated balance sheets or income statements or have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.  Refer to Note 25 for the incremental disclosures required under the standard.\nWe also adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) during 2024, none of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures:\nASU\nEffective Date\n2023-01\nLeases: Common Control Arrangements\nJanuary 1, 2024\n2023-02\nInvestments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures:  Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method\nJanuary 1, 2024\nAccounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n.  In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures.  The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application permitted.  There will be no impact to our consolidated balance sheets or income statements; however, there will be changes to our consolidated financial statement disclosures, primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and cash paid for income taxes.\nASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“DISE”)\n.  In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to improve the disclosures about an entity’s expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses included in commonly presented expense captions.  The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with retrospective application permitted.  We are assessing the effect on our consolidated financial statement disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our consolidated balance sheets or income statements.\nAll other ASUs issued but not yet adopted were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.\n120\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 4.  \nREVENUE \nThe following tables disaggregate our revenue by major source for the years ended December 31 (in millions):  \n2022\nCompany excluding Ford Credit\nFord Credit\nConsolidated\nVehicles, parts, and accessories\n$\n144,471\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n144,471\n \nUsed vehicles\n1,719\n \n—\n \n1,719\n \nServices and other revenue (a)\n2,688\n \n100\n \n2,788\n \nRevenues from sales and services\n148,878\n \n100\n \n148,978\n \nLeasing income\n201\n \n4,569\n \n4,770\n \nFinancing income\n—\n \n4,254\n \n4,254\n \nInsurance income\n—\n \n55\n \n55\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n149,079\n \n$\n8,978\n \n$\n158,057\n \n2023\nCompany excluding Ford Credit\nFord Credit\nConsolidated\nVehicles, parts, and accessories\n$\n161,052\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n161,052\n \nUsed vehicles\n1,873\n \n—\n \n1,873\n \nServices and other revenue (a)\n2,797\n \n105\n \n2,902\n \nRevenues from sales and services\n165,722\n \n105\n \n165,827\n \nLeasing income\n179\n \n4,105\n \n4,284\n \nFinancing income\n—\n \n5,980\n \n5,980\n \nInsurance income\n—\n \n100\n \n100\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n165,901\n \n$\n10,290\n \n$\n176,191\n \n2024\nCompany excluding Ford Credit\nFord Credit\nConsolidated\nVehicles, parts, and accessories\n$\n167,218\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n167,218\n \nUsed vehicles\n2,175\n \n—\n \n2,175\n \nServices and other revenue (a)\n3,099\n \n104\n \n3,203\n \nRevenues from sales and services\n172,492\n \n104\n \n172,596\n \nLeasing income\n214\n \n4,217\n \n4,431\n \nFinancing income\n—\n \n7,819\n \n7,819\n \nInsurance income\n—\n \n146\n \n146\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n172,706\n \n$\n12,286\n \n$\n184,992\n \n__________\n(a)\nIncludes extended service contract revenue.\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied; generally this occurs when we transfer control of our vehicles, parts, or accessories, or provide services.  \nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.  For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities.  However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity.  Sales, value-added, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\n  Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense.  The expected costs associated with our base warranties and field service actions are recognized as expense when the products are sold (see Note 24).  We do not have any material significant payment terms related to vehicle sales, as payment is received at or shortly after the point of sale. \n121\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 4.  REVENUE \n(Continued)\nCompany Excluding Ford Credit\nVehicles, Parts, and Accessories.  \nFor the majority of vehicles, parts, and accessories, we transfer control and recognize a sale when we ship the product from our manufacturing facility to our customer (dealers and distributors).  We receive cash equal to the invoice price for most vehicle sales at the time of wholesale.  When the vehicle sale is financed by our wholly-owned subsidiary Ford Credit, the dealer is obligated to pay Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to the retail customer (see Note 10).  Payment terms on part sales to dealers, distributors, and retailers generally range from \n30\n to \n120\n days.  The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize varies with changes in return rights, marketing incentives we offer to our customers and their customers, and other pricing adjustments.  When we give our dealers the right to return eligible parts and accessories, we estimate the expected returns based on an analysis of historical experience.  Estimates of marketing incentives and other pricing adjustments are based on our expectation of retail and fleet sales volumes, mix of products to be sold, competitor actions, and incentive programs to be offered.  Customer acceptance of products and programs, as well as other market conditions, will impact these estimates.  We adjust our estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the value of consideration we expect to receive changes or when the consideration becomes fixed. \n As a result of changes in our estimate of variable consideration (e.g., marketing incentives), we recorded an increase in revenue of $\n209\n million during 2022 and a decrease in revenue of $\n147\n million and $\n757\n million during 2023 and 2024, respectively, related to revenue recognized in prior annual periods.\nWe have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories has transferred to the customer as an expense in \nCost of sales\n.\nWe sell vehicles to daily rental companies and may guarantee that we will pay them the difference between an agreed amount and the value they are able to realize upon resale.  At the time of transfer of vehicles to the daily rental companies, we record the probable amount we will pay under the guarantee to \nOther liabilities and deferred revenue \n(see Note 24)\n.\nUsed Vehicles.\n  We sell used vehicles both at auction and through our consolidated dealerships.  Proceeds from the sale of these vehicles are recognized in \nCompany excluding Ford Credit revenues\n upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer, and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in \nCost of sales\n.  \nServices and other revenue.  \nFor separate or stand-ready performance obligations that are included as part of the vehicle consideration received (e.g., free extended service contracts, vehicle connectivity, over-the-air updates), we use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price or, when one is not available, we use a cost-plus margin approach.  We also sell separately priced service contracts that extend mechanical and maintenance coverages beyond our base warranty agreements to vehicle owners.  We receive payment at contract inception and the contracts generally range from \n12\n to \n120\n months.  We recognize revenue for vehicle service contracts that extend mechanical and maintenance coverages beyond our base warranties over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations.  Revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed.\nWe had a balance of $\n4.4\n billion and $\n4.8\n billion of unearned revenue associated primarily with outstanding extended service contracts reported in \nOther liabilities and deferred revenue \nat December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  We recognized\n \n$\n1.5\n billion and $\n1.8\n billion of the unearned amounts as revenue during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  At December 31, 2024, the unearned amount was $\n5.3\n billion.  We expect to recognize approximately $\n1.7\n billion of the unearned amount in 2025, $\n1.3\n billion in 2026, and $\n2.3\n billion thereafter.\nWe record a premium deficiency reserve to the extent we estimate the future costs associated with extended service contracts exceed the unrecognized revenue.  Amounts paid to dealers to obtain these contracts are deferred and recorded as \nOther assets\n.  These costs are amortized to expense consistent with how the related revenue is recognized.\n  We had a balance of $\n317\n million and $\n312\n million in deferred costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  We recognized $\n88\n million, $\n103\n million, and $\n105\n million of amortization during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\n122\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 4.  REVENUE \n(Continued)\nWe also receive other revenue related to vehicle-related design and testing services we perform for others, various Ford Next operations, and net commissions for serving as the agent in facilitating the sale of a third party’s products or services to our customers.  We have applied the practical expedient to recognize \nCompany excluding Ford Credit revenues\n for vehicle-related design and testing services over the term of the related agreements (generally \ntwo\n to \nthree\n years) in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice.\nLeasing Income.  \nWe earn income from operating lease assets and record the income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement.  \nFord Credit Segment\nLeasing Income.\n  Ford Credit offers leasing plans to retail consumers through Ford and Lincoln brand dealers that originate the leases.  Ford Credit records an operating lease upon purchase of a vehicle subject to a lease from the dealer.  The retail consumer makes lease payments representing the difference between Ford Credit’s purchase price of the vehicle and the contractual residual value of the vehicle plus lease fees, which we recognize on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement.  Depreciation and the gain or loss upon disposition of the vehicle is recorded in \nFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses\n.\nFinancing Income.\n  Ford Credit originates and purchases finance installment contracts.  Financing income represents interest earned on the finance receivables (including sales-type and direct financing leases).  Interest is recognized using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain direct origination costs.  \nInsurance Income. \n Income from insurance contracts is recognized evenly over the term of the agreement.  Insurance commission revenue is recognized on a net basis at the time of sale of the third party’s product or service to our customer.\nNOTE 5.  \nOTHER INCOME/(LOSS)\nThe amounts included in \nOther income/(loss), net\n for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in millions):\n \n2022\n2023\n2024\nNet periodic pension and OPEB income/(cost), excluding service cost (Note 16)\n$\n1,336\n \n$\n(\n2,494\n)\n$\n411\n \nInvestment-related interest income\n639\n \n1,567\n \n1,540\n \nInterest income/(expense) on income taxes\n(\n23\n)\n(\n16\n)\n(\n21\n)\nRealized and unrealized gains/(losses) on cash equivalents, marketable securities, and other investments (a)\n(\n7,518\n)\n(\n205\n)\n(\n42\n)\nGains/(Losses) on changes in investments in affiliates (Note 20 and Note 21)\n(\n147\n)\n9\n \n78\n \nRoyalty income\n483\n \n477\n \n503\n \nOther\n80\n \n59\n \n(\n18\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n5,150\n)\n$\n(\n603\n)\n$\n2,451\n \n__________\n(a)    Includes a $\n7.4\n billion loss and $\n31\n million loss on our Rivian investment during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n123\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 6.  \nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION \nUnder our Long-Term Incentive Plans, we may issue restricted stock units (“RSUs”), restricted stock shares (“RSSs”), and stock options.  RSUs and RSSs consist of time-based and performance-based awards.  The number of shares that may be granted in any year is limited to \n2\n% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock as of December 31 of the prior calendar year.  The limit may be increased up to \n3\n% in any year, with a corresponding reduction in shares available for grants in future years.  Granted RSUs generally cliff vest or ratably vest over a \nthree-year\n service period.  Performance-based RSUs can be based on internal financial performance metrics or total shareholder return relative to a peer group or a combination of the two metrics.  At the time of vest, RSU awards are net settled (i.e., shares are withheld to cover the employee tax obligation).  Stock options ratably vest over a \nthree-year\n service period and expire \nten years\n from the grant date.\nThe fair value of both the time-based and the internal performance metrics portion of the performance-based RSUs and RSSs is determined using the closing price of our Common Stock at grant date.  For awards that include a market condition, we measure the fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation.  \nThe weighted average per unit grant date fair value for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024 was $\n15.63\n, $\n12.98\n, and $\n12.49\n, respectively.\nTime-based RSUs generally have a graded vesting feature whereby one-third of each grant vests after the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third after the second anniversary, and one-third after the third anniversary.  The graded vesting method recognizes expense over the service period for each separately-vesting tranche, which results in accelerated recognition of expense.  The fair value of time-based RSUs, RSSs, and stock options is expensed over the shorter of each separate vesting period, using the graded vesting method, or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement.  The fair value of performance-based RSUs and RSSs is expensed when it is probable and estimable as measured against the performance metrics over the shorter of the performance or required service periods.  We measure the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (for options without a market condition) or a Monte Carlo simulation (for options with a market condition).  We have elected to recognize forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense for all RSUs, RSSs, and stock options in the same period as the forfeitures occur.  Expense is recorded in \nSelling, administrative, and other expenses \nand\n Cost of sales,\n as incurred.\nRestricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Shares\nThe fair value of vested RSUs and RSSs as well as the compensation cost for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in millions):\n \n2022\n2023\n2024\nFair value of vested shares\n$\n252\n \n$\n303\n \n$\n522\n \nCompensation cost (a)\n223\n \n356\n \n411\n \n__________\n(a)    Net of tax benefit of $\n113\n million, $\n104\n million, and $\n100\n million in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there was approximately $\n450\n million in unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs.  This expense will be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.9\n years.\nThe performance-based RSUs granted in March 2022, 2023, and 2024 include a relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) metric.\n \nInputs and assumptions used to calculate the fair value at grant date through a Monte Carlo simulation were as follows:\n \n2022\n2023\n2024\nFair value per stock award\n$\n18.10\n \n$\n18.57\n \n$\n18.50\n \nGrant date stock price\n16.85\n \n13.08\n \n12.74\n \nAssumptions:\nFord’s stock price expected volatility (a)\n44.8\n \n%\n49.5\n \n%\n41.9\n \n%\nExpected average volatility of peer companies (a)\n39.6\n \n49.6\n \n40.7\n \nRisk-free interest rate\n1.62\n \n4.57\n \n4.43\n \n__________\n(a)\nExpected volatility based on \nthree years\n of daily closing share price changes ending on the grant date.\n124\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 6.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION \n(Continued)\nDuring 2024, activity for RSUs and RSSs was as follows (in millions, except for weighted-average fair value):\n \nShares\nWeighted-\nAverage \nFair Value\nOutstanding, beginning of year\n80.6\n \n$\n13.86\n \nGranted (a)\n61.8\n \n12.49\n \nVested (a)\n(\n41.9\n)\n12.45\n \nForfeited\n(\n4.8\n)\n13.62\n \nOutstanding, end of year (b)\n95.7\n \n13.44\n \n__________\n(a)\nIncludes shares awarded to non-employee directors.\n(b)\nExcludes \n1,285,271\n non-employee director shares that were vested but unissued at December 31, 2024.\nStock Options\nDuring 2024, \nno\n stock options were granted or exercised.

We recognize income tax-related interest income and interest expense in \nOther income/(loss), net \non our consolidated income statements.\nWe account for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income in the period incurred, and we account for investment tax credits using the deferral method.  \nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis.  We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.\n125\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 7.  INCOME TAXES\n (Continued)\nOur accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns and their future probability.  In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets.  If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance.\nComponents of Income Taxes\nComponents of income taxes excluding cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles, other comprehensive income/(loss), and equity in net results of affiliated companies accounted for after-tax for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\n \n2022\n2023\n2024\nIncome/(Loss) before income taxes (in millions)\n \n \n \nU.S.\n$\n(\n6,548\n)\n$\n3,395\n \n$\n3,424\n \nNon-U.S.\n3,532\n \n572\n \n3,809\n \nTotal\n$\n(\n3,016\n)\n$\n3,967\n \n$\n7,233\n \nProvision for/(Benefit from) income taxes (in millions)\n \nCurrent\n \nFederal\n$\n68\n \n$\n62\n \n$\n78\n \nNon-U.S.\n781\n \n948\n \n791\n \nState and local\n123\n \n229\n \n107\n \nTotal current\n972\n \n1,239\n \n976\n \nDeferred\n \nFederal\n(\n2,292\n)\n(\n413\n)\n25\n \nNon-U.S.\n688\n \n(\n1,149\n)\n303\n \nState and local\n(\n232\n)\n(\n39\n)\n35\n \nTotal deferred\n(\n1,836\n)\n(\n1,601\n)\n363\n \nTotal\n$\n(\n864\n)\n$\n(\n362\n)\n$\n1,339\n \nReconciliation of effective tax rate\n \nU.S. statutory tax rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nNon-U.S. tax rate differential\n(\n8.7\n)\n(\n3.4\n)\n2.9\n \nState and local income taxes\n2.3\n \n1.9\n \n1.7\n \nGeneral business credits\n13.0\n \n(\n15.9\n)\n(\n5.9\n)\nNontaxable foreign currency gains and losses\n(\n4.2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nDispositions and restructurings (a)\n(\n7.0\n)\n(\n14.7\n)\n—\n \nU.S. tax on non-U.S. earnings\n2.8\n \n7.7\n \n(\n0.2\n)\nPrior year settlements and claims\n1.5\n \n1.2\n \n0.1\n \nTax incentives\n2.0\n \n(\n3.9\n)\n(\n2.2\n)\nEnacted change in tax laws\n(\n2.0\n)\n0.1\n \n0.4\n \nValuation allowances\n6.2\n \n(\n0.7\n)\n(\n1.0\n)\nOther\n1.7\n \n(\n2.4\n)\n1.7\n \nEffective tax rate\n28.6\n \n%\n(\n9.1\n)\n%\n18.5\n \n%\n__________\n(a)\n2023 includes benefits of $\n610\n million associated with legal entity restructuring within our leasing operations and China.\nIn 2022, we reversed $\n405\n million of previously established U.S. valuation allowances, primarily as a result of planning actions.\nAt December 31, 2024, $\n14.7\n billion of non-U.S. earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States, for which deferred taxes have not been provided.

Dealer financing includes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance other dealer programs.  Wholesale financing is approximately \n97\n% of dealer financing.\nFinance receivables are recorded at the time of origination or purchase at fair value and are subsequently reported at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses.\n \nFor all finance receivables, Ford Credit defines “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, that is at least \n31\n days past the contractual due date.\nFinance Receivables Classification\nFinance receivables are accounted for as held for investment (“HFI”) if Ford Credit has the intent and ability to hold the receivables for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff.  The determination of intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future is highly judgmental and requires Ford Credit to make good faith estimates based on all information available at the time of origination or purchase.\n  If Ford Credit does not have the intent and ability to hold the receivables, then the receivables are classified as HFS.\nEach quarter, Ford Credit makes a determination of whether it is probable that finance receivables originated or purchased during the quarter will be held for the foreseeable future based on historical receivables sale experience, internal forecasts and budgets, as well as other relevant, reliable information available through the date of evaluation.  For purposes of this determination, probable means at least \n70\n% likely and, consistent with the budgeting and forecasting period, the foreseeable future means twelve months.  Ford Credit classifies receivables as HFI or HFS on a receivable-by-receivable basis.  Specific receivables included in off-balance sheet sale transactions are generally not identified until the month in which the sale occurs.\nHeld-for-Investment.  \nFinance receivables classified as HFI are recorded at the time of origination or purchase at fair value and are subsequently reported at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses.  Cash flows from finance receivables, excluding wholesale and other receivables, that were originally classified as HFI are recorded as an investing activity since GAAP requires the statement of cash flows presentation to be based on the original classification of the receivables.  Cash flows from wholesale and other receivables are recorded as an operating activity.\nHeld-for-Sale.  \nFinance receivables classified as HFS are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.  Cash flows resulting from the origination or purchase and sale of HFS receivables are recorded as an operating activity in \nDecrease/(Increase) in finance receivables (wholesale and other)\n.  Once a decision has been made to sell receivables that were originally classified as HFI, the receivables are reclassified as HFS and carried at the lower of cost or fair value.  The valuation adjustment, if applicable, is recorded in \nOther income/(loss), net\n to recognize the receivables at the lower of cost or fair value.\n133\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 10.  FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n(Continued)\nFord Credit finance receivables, net\n at December 31 were as follows (in millions):\n \n2023\n2024\nConsumer\n \n \nRetail installment contracts, gross\n$\n73,825\n \n$\n79,459\n \nFinance leases, gross\n7,793\n \n8,357\n \nRetail financing, gross\n81,618\n \n87,816\n \nUnearned interest supplements\n(\n3,344\n)\n(\n4,598\n)\nConsumer finance receivables\n78,274\n \n83,218\n \nNon-Consumer\n \nDealer financing\n24,683\n \n29,282\n \nNon-Consumer finance receivables\n24,683\n \n29,282\n \nTotal recorded investment\n$\n102,957\n \n$\n112,500\n \nRecorded investment in finance receivables\n$\n102,957\n \n$\n112,500\n \nAllowance for credit losses\n(\n882\n)\n(\n864\n)\nTotal finance receivables, net\n$\n102,075\n \n$\n111,636\n \nCurrent portion\n$\n46,425\n \n$\n51,850\n \nNon-current portion\n55,650\n \n59,786\n \nTotal finance receivables, net\n$\n102,075\n \n$\n111,636\n \nNet finance receivables subject to fair value (a)\n$\n94,728\n \n$\n103,755\n \nFair value (b)\n93,189\n \n103,231\n \n__________\n(a)\nNet finance receivables subject to fair value exclude finance leases.\n(b)\nThe fair value of finance receivables is categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nFord Credit’s finance leases are comprised of sales-type and direct financing leases.

The receivables are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations or the claims of Ford Credit’s other creditors.  Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions (see Note 23).\nCredit Quality\nConsumer Portfolio\nWhen originating consumer receivables, Ford Credit uses a proprietary scoring system that measures credit quality using information in the credit application, proposed contract terms, credit bureau data, and other information.  After a proprietary risk score is generated, Ford Credit decides whether to purchase a contract using a decision process based on a judgmental evaluation of the applicant, the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score), proprietary risk score, and other information.  The evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, applicant credit history, and stability as key considerations.\nAfter origination, Ford Credit reviews the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity.  As each customer develops a payment history, an internally developed behavioral scoring model is used to assist in determining the best collection strategies, which allows Ford Credit to focus collection activity on higher-risk accounts.  These models are used to refine Ford Credit’s risk-based staffing model to ensure collection resources are aligned with portfolio risk.

Payment is typically required when the dealer has sold the vehicle.  Each non-consumer lending request is evaluated by considering the borrower’s financial condition and the underlying collateral securing the loan.  Ford Credit uses a proprietary model to assign each dealer a risk rating.  This model uses historical dealer performance data to identify key factors about a dealer that are considered most significant in predicting a dealer’s ability to meet its financial obligations.  Ford Credit also considers numerous other financial and qualitative factors of the dealer’s operations, including capitalization and leverage, liquidity and cash flow, profitability, and credit history with Ford Credit and other creditors.\nDealers are assigned to one of four groups according to risk ratings as follows:\n•\nGroup I\n – strong to superior financial metrics;\n•\nGroup II\n – fair to favorable financial metrics;\n•\nGroup III\n – marginal to weak financial metrics; and\n•\nGroup IV\n – poor financial metrics, including dealers classified as uncollectible.\nFord Credit generally suspends credit lines and extends no further funding to dealers classified in Group IV.\n136\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 10.  FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n(Continued)\nFord Credit regularly reviews the model to confirm the continued business significance and statistical predictability of the model and may make updates to improve the performance of the model.  In addition, Ford Credit regularly audits dealer inventory and dealer sales records to verify that the dealer is in possession of the financed vehicles and is promptly paying each receivable following the sale of the financed vehicle.  The frequency of on-site vehicle inventory audits depends primarily on the dealer’s risk rating.  Under Ford Credit’s policies, on-site vehicle inventory audits of low-risk dealers are conducted only as circumstances warrant.  On-site vehicle inventory audits of higher-risk dealers are conducted with increased frequency based primarily on the dealer’s risk rating, but also considering the results of electronic monitoring of the dealer’s performance, including daily payment verifications and monthly analyses of the dealer’s financial statements, payoffs, aged inventory, over credit line, and delinquency reports.  Ford Credit typically performs a credit review of each dealer annually and more frequently reviews certain dealers based on the dealer’s risk rating and total exposure.  Ford Credit adjusts the dealer’s risk rating, if necessary.  The credit quality of dealer financing receivables is evaluated based on Ford Credit’s internal dealer risk rating analysis.  A dealer has the same risk rating for its entire dealer financing regardless of the type of financing.\nThe credit quality analysis of dealer financing receivables at December 31, 2023 was as follows (in millions): \nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year\nWholesale Loans\nDealer Loans\nPrior to 2019\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nTotal\nTotal\nPercent\nGroup I\n$\n383\n \n$\n30\n \n$\n58\n \n$\n156\n \n$\n61\n \n$\n331\n \n$\n1,019\n \n$\n20,419\n \n$\n21,438\n \n86.9\n \n%\nGroup II\n16\n \n—\n \n1\n \n3\n \n2\n \n44\n \n66\n \n2,834\n \n2,900\n \n11.7\n \nGroup III\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n8\n \n9\n \n292\n \n301\n \n1.2\n \nGroup IV\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n3\n \n41\n \n44\n \n0.2\n \nTotal (a)\n$\n399\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n59\n \n$\n159\n \n$\n64\n \n$\n385\n \n$\n1,097\n \n$\n23,586\n \n$\n24,683\n \n100.0\n \n%\nGross charge-offs\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n4\n \n__________\n(a)\nTotal past due dealer financing receivables at December 31, 2023 were $\n33\n million.\nThe credit quality analysis of dealer financing receivables at December 31, 2024 was as follows (in millions):\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year\nWholesale Loans\nDealer Loans\nPrior to 2020\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nTotal\nTotal\nPercent\nGroup I\n$\n270\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n97\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n217\n \n$\n245\n \n$\n939\n \n$\n25,257\n \n$\n26,196\n \n89.4\n \n%\nGroup II\n13\n \n—\n \n3\n \n1\n \n28\n \n31\n \n76\n \n2,494\n \n2,570\n \n8.8\n \nGroup III\n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n1\n \n4\n \n7\n \n462\n \n469\n \n1.6\n \nGroup IV\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \n46\n \n47\n \n0.2\n \nTotal (a)\n$\n283\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n102\n \n$\n48\n \n$\n246\n \n$\n281\n \n$\n1,023\n \n$\n28,259\n \n$\n29,282\n \n100.0\n \n%\nGross charge-offs\n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n7\n \n__________\n(a)\nTotal past due dealer financing receivables at December 31, 2024 were $\n8\n million.\nNon-Accrual of Revenue.  \nThe accrual of financing revenue is discontinued at the time a receivable is determined to be uncollectible or when it is \n90\n days past due.  Accounts may be restored to accrual status only when a customer settles all past-due deficiency balances and future payments are reasonably assured.  For receivables in non-accrual status, subsequent financing revenue is recognized only to the extent a payment is received.  Payments are generally applied first to outstanding interest and then to the unpaid principal balance.\nLoan Modifications.\n  Consumer and non-consumer receivables that have a modified interest rate and/or a term extension (including receivables that were modified in reorganization proceedings pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) are typically considered to be loan modifications.  Ford Credit does not grant modifications to the principal balance of the receivables.  If a receivable is modified in a reorganization proceeding, all payment requirements of the reorganization plan need to be met before remaining balances are forgiven.\n137\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 10.  FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n(Continued)\nThe use of interest rate modifications and term extensions helps Ford Credit mitigate financial loss.  Term extensions may assist in cases where Ford Credit believes the customer will recover from short-term financial difficulty and resume regularly scheduled payments.  The effect of most loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is included in the historical trends used to measure the allowance for credit losses.  A loan modification that improves the delinquency status of a borrower reduces the probability of default, which results in a lower allowance for credit losses.  At December 31, 2024, an insignificant portion of Ford Credit's total finance receivables portfolio had been granted a loan modification, and these modifications are generally treated as a continuation of the existing loan.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date.  The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly.\nAdjustments to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to \nFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses\n on our consolidated income statements.  The uncollectible portion of a finance receivable is charged to the allowance for credit losses at the earlier of when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is \n120\n days delinquent, taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer or borrower, the value of the collateral, recourse to guarantors, and other factors.\nCharge-offs on finance receivables include uncollected amounts related to principal, interest, late fees, and other allowable charges.  Recoveries on finance receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for credit losses.  In the event Ford Credit repossesses the collateral, the receivable is charged off and the collateral is recorded at its estimated fair value less costs to sell and reported in \nOther assets\n on our consolidated balance sheets.\nConsumer Portfolio\nFor consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics such as product type, initial credit risk, term, vintage, geography, and other relevant factors, Ford Credit estimates the lifetime expected credit loss allowance based on a collective assessment\n \nusing measurement models and management judgment.  The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumptions to monthly expected exposures, then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivable’s original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable.  Probability of default models are developed from internal risk scoring models taking into account the expected probability of payment and time to default, adjusted for macroeconomic outlook and recent performance.  The models consider factors such as risk evaluation at the time of origination, historical trends in credit losses, and the composition and recent performance of the present portfolio (including vehicle brand, term, risk evaluation, and new/used vehicles).  The loss given default is the percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable, taking into account the expected collateral value and trends in recoveries (including key metrics such as delinquencies, repossessions, and bankruptcies).  Monthly exposures are equal to the receivables’ expected outstanding principal and interest balance.\nThe allowance for credit losses incorporates forward-looking macroeconomic conditions for baseline, upturn, and downturn scenarios.  Three separate credit loss allowances are calculated from these scenarios.  They are then probability-weighted to determine the quantitative estimate of the credit loss allowance recognized in the financial statements.  Ford Credit uses forecasts from a third party that revert to a long-term historical average after a reasonable and supportable forecasting period, which is specific to the particular macroeconomic variable and which varies by market.  Ford Credit updates the forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts quarterly.\nIf management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors, including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.\nOn an ongoing basis, Ford Credit reviews its models, including macroeconomic factors, the selection of macroeconomic scenarios, and their weighting, to ensure they reflect the risk of the portfolio.\n138\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 10.  FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n(Continued)\nNon-Consumer Portfolio\nDealer financing is evaluated on an individual dealer basis by segmenting dealers by risk characteristics (such as the amount of the loans, the nature of the collateral, and the financial status of the dealer) to determine if an individual dealer requires a specific allowance for credit loss.  If required, the allowance is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the dealer’s receivables discounted at the loans’ original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell.\nFor the remaining dealer financing, Ford Credit estimates an allowance for credit losses on a collective basis.\nWholesale Loans. \n Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans based on historical loss-to-receivable (“LTR”) ratios, expected future cash flows, and the fair value of collateral.  The LTR model is based on the most recent years of history.  An LTR ratio is calculated by dividing credit losses (i.e., charge-offs net of recoveries) by average net finance receivables, excluding allowance for credit losses.  The average LTR ratio is multiplied by the end-of-period balances, representing the lifetime expected credit loss reserve.\nDealer Loans.\n  Ford Credit uses a weighted-average remaining maturity method to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss reserve for dealer loans.  The loss model is based on industrywide commercial real estate credit losses, adjusted to factor in the historical credit losses for the dealer loans portfolio.  The expected credit loss is calculated under different macroeconomic scenarios that are weighted to provide the total lifetime expected credit loss.\nAfter establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit losses, if management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant forward-looking economic factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment.\n139\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 10.  FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n(Continued)\nAn analysis of the allowance for credit losses related to finance receivables for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in millions): \n2023\n \nConsumer\nNon-Consumer\nTotal\nAllowance for credit losses\nBeginning balance\n$\n838\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n845\n \nCharge-offs\n(\n401\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n405\n)\nRecoveries\n151\n \n2\n \n153\n \nProvision for credit losses\n280\n \n(\n2\n)\n278\n \nOther (a)\n11\n \n—\n \n11\n \nEnding balance\n$\n879\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n882\n \n2024\n \nConsumer\nNon-Consumer\nTotal\nAllowance for credit losses\n \n \n \nBeginning balance\n$\n879\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n882\n \nCharge-offs\n(\n568\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n575\n)\nRecoveries\n160\n \n3\n \n163\n \nProvision for credit losses\n412\n \n5\n \n417\n \nOther (a)\n(\n23\n)\n—\n \n(\n23\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n860\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n864\n \n__________\n(a)\nPrimarily represents amounts related to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses decreased $\n18\n million, reflecting improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, offset partially by an increase in Ford Credit consumer receivables.\nNOTE 11.  \nINVENTORIES \nAll inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.

We determined that Argo AI no longer had value as a going concern, and as a result, we reassessed the carrying value of our investment as of September 30, 2022.  Our valuation assumed an orderly conclusion of operations at Argo AI, in which the cash required to satisfy the remaining obligations would consume all of Argo AI’s remaining capital.  In addition, we assessed whether Argo AI’s technology components had value in isolation, and we concluded that the cost to integrate into anticipated technology ecosystems would be prohibitive.  Accordingly, we recorded a $\n2.7\n billion pre-tax impairment in the third quarter of 2022.  The non-cash charge was reported in \nEquity in net income/(loss) of affiliated companies\n.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Ford and Volkswagen AG, who held equal interests that together comprised a majority ownership of Argo AI, initiated the process of exiting the joint development of highly automated driving technology (L4) through Argo AI.

The measurement of projected future benefits is dependent on the provisions of each specific plan, demographics of the group covered by the plan, and other key measurement assumptions.  For plans that provide benefits dependent on salary assumptions, we include a projection of salary growth in our measurements.  No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).\nNet periodic benefit costs, including service cost, interest cost, and expected return on assets, are determined using assumptions regarding the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets (where applicable) as of the beginning of each year.  We have elected to use a fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets in net periodic benefit cost.  The funded status of the benefit plans, which represents the difference between the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, is calculated on a plan-by-plan basis.  The benefit obligation and related funded status are determined using assumptions as of the end of each year.  Actuarial gains and losses resulting from plan remeasurement are recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the period of the remeasurement.  The impact of a retroactive plan amendment is recorded in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) \nand is amortized as a component of net periodic cost, generally over the remaining service period of the active employees.  The service cost component is included in \nCost of sales\n and \nSelling, administrative, and other expenses\n.  Other components of net periodic benefit cost/(income) are included in \nOther income/(loss), net\n on our consolidated income statements.\nA curtailment results from an event that significantly reduces the expected years of future service or eliminates the accrual of defined benefits for the future services of a significant number of employees.  A curtailment gain is recorded when the employees who are entitled to a benefit terminate their employment or when a plan suspension or amendment that results in a curtailment gain is adopted.  A curtailment loss is recorded when it becomes probable a curtailment loss will occur.  We recognize settlement expense when the costs associated with all settlements during the year exceed the interest component of net periodic cost for the affected plan.  Expense from curtailments and settlements is recorded in \nOther income/(loss), net\n.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans. \n We have defined benefit pension plans covering hourly and salaried employees in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other locations.  The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is associated with our U.S. plans.  Virtually all of our worldwide defined benefit plans are closed to new participants.\nIn general, our defined benefit pension plans are funded (i.e., have restricted assets from which benefits are paid).  Our unfunded defined benefit pension plans are treated on a “pay as you go” basis with benefit payments from general Company cash.  These unfunded plans primarily include certain plans in Germany and the U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management.  \nOPEB\n.  We have defined benefit OPEB plans, primarily certain health care and life insurance benefits, covering hourly and salaried employees in the United States, Canada, and other locations.  The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is associated with our U.S. plans.  Our OPEB plans are unfunded and the benefits are paid from general Company cash. \nDefined Contribution and Savings Plans\n.  We also have defined contribution and savings plans for hourly and salaried employees in the United States and other locations.  Company contributions to these plans, if any, are made from general Company cash and are expensed as incurred.\n  The expense for our worldwide defined contribution and savings plans was $\n478\n million, $\n546\n million, and $\n699\n million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.  This includes the expense for Company-matching contributions to our primary employee savings plan in the United States of $\n152\n million, $\n155\n million, and $\n177\n million for the years ended

related to changes in discount rates.\nPension Plan Contributions\nOur policy for funded pension plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by applicable laws and regulations.  We may make contributions beyond those legally required.\nIn 2024, we contributed $\n1,073\n million to our global funded pension plans and made $\n420\n million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans.  During 2025, we expect to contribute about $\n800\n million of cash to our global funded pension plans.  We also expect to make about $\n450\n million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans.  Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans in 2025.\nExpected Future Benefit Payments\nThe expected future benefit payments at December 31, 2024 were as follows (in millions):\n \nBenefit Payments\n \nPension\nOPEB\n \nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S.\nPlans\nWorldwide\n2025\n$\n2,685\n \n$\n1,365\n \n$\n345\n \n2026\n2,650\n \n1,275\n \n340\n \n2027\n2,605\n \n1,290\n \n335\n \n2028\n2,575\n \n1,295\n \n335\n \n2029\n2,575\n \n1,310\n \n330\n \n2030-2034\n12,180\n \n6,575\n \n1,590\n \nPension Plan Asset Information\nInvestment Objectives and Strategies\n.  Our investment objectives for the U.S. plans are to minimize the volatility of the value of our U.S. pension assets relative to U.S. pension obligations and to ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits.  Our largest non-U.S. plans (e.g., the United Kingdom and Canada) have similar investment objectives to the U.S. plans. \nInvestment strategies and policies for the U.S. plans and the largest non-U.S. plans reflect a balance of risk-reducing and return-seeking considerations.  The objective of minimizing the volatility of assets relative to obligations is addressed primarily through asset-liability matching, asset diversification, and hedging.  The fixed income asset allocation matches the bond-like and long-dated nature of the pension obligations.  Assets are broadly diversified within asset classes to achieve risk-adjusted returns that, in total, lower asset volatility relative to the obligations.  Strategies to address the goal of ensuring sufficient assets to pay benefits include target allocations to a broad array of asset classes, and strategies within asset classes that provide adequate returns, diversification, and liquidity.\n149\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 16.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS \n(Continued)\nDerivatives are permitted for fixed income investment and public equity managers to use as efficient substitutes for traditional securities and to manage exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks.  Interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments are used for the purpose of hedging changes in the fair value of assets that result from interest rate changes and currency fluctuations.  Interest rate derivatives are also used to adjust portfolio duration.  Derivatives may not be used to leverage or to alter the economic exposure to an asset class outside the scope of the mandate an investment manager has been given.  Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage (including through the use of derivatives or other tools) that may alter economic exposure.\nAlternative investments execute diverse strategies that provide exposure to a broad range of hedge fund strategies, equity investments in private companies, and investments in private property funds.\nSignificant Concentrations of Risk.\n  Significant concentrations of risk in our plan assets relate to interest rates, growth assets, and operating risks.  In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the obligations, the majority of plan assets are allocated to fixed income investments, which are exposed to interest rate risk.  Rate increases generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets, while reducing the present value of the obligations.  Conversely, rate decreases generally will increase the value of fixed income assets, offsetting the related increase in the obligations.\nIn order to ensure assets are sufficient to pay benefits, a portion of plan assets is allocated to growth assets (primarily hedge funds, real estate, private equity, and public equity) that are expected over time to earn higher returns with more volatility than fixed income investments, which more closely match pension obligations.  Within growth assets, risk is mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by asset class, investment strategy, manager, style, and process.\nOperating risks include the risks of inadequate diversification and weak controls.  To mitigate these risks, investments are diversified across and within asset classes in support of investment objectives.  Policies and practices to address operating risks include ongoing manager oversight (e.g., style adherence, team strength, firm health, and internal risk controls), plan and asset class investment guidelines and instructions that are communicated to managers, and periodic compliance reviews to ensure adherence.\nAt year-end 2024, Ford securities comprised less than \n1\n% of our plan assets.\nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets.  \nThe long-term return assumption at year-end 2024, which will be used to determine the 2025 expected return on assets, is \n6.37\n% for the U.S. plans, \n5.29\n% for the U.K. plans, and \n5.00\n% for the Canadian plans, and averages \n5.23\n% for all non-U.S. plans.  A generally consistent approach is used worldwide to develop this assumption.  This approach considers inputs from advisors for long-term capital market returns adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan.  Historical returns also are considered where appropriate.  The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences.\n150\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 16.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS \n(Continued)\nThe fair value of our defined benefit pension plan assets (including dividends and interest receivables of $\n239\n million and $\n58\n million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively) by asset category at December 31 was as follows (in millions):\n2023\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\n \nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets measured at NAV (a)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets measured at NAV (a)\nTotal\nAsset Category\n \n \n \n \nEquity\n \n \n \n \nU.S. companies\n$\n855\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n858\n \n$\n1,968\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,005\n \nInternational companies\n493\n \n29\n \n6\n \n—\n \n528\n \n1,293\n \n20\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,313\n \nTotal equity\n1,348\n \n30\n \n8\n \n—\n \n1,386\n \n3,261\n \n57\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,318\n \nFixed Income\nU.S. government and agencies\n7,236\n \n1,493\n \n—\n \n—\n \n8,729\n \n38\n \n28\n \n—\n \n—\n \n66\n \nNon-U.S. government\n2\n \n482\n \n2\n \n—\n \n486\n \n—\n \n12,843\n \n184\n \n—\n \n13,027\n \nCorporate bonds \n—\n \n16,470\n \n11\n \n—\n \n16,481\n \n—\n \n1,890\n \n66\n \n—\n \n1,956\n \nMortgage/other asset-backed\n—\n \n444\n \n—\n \n—\n \n444\n \n—\n \n289\n \n11\n \n—\n \n300\n \nCommingled funds\n—\n \n65\n \n—\n \n—\n \n65\n \n23\n \n191\n \n—\n \n—\n \n214\n \nDerivative financial instruments, net\n(\n3\n)\n161\n \n—\n \n—\n \n158\n \n—\n \n36\n \n36\n \n—\n \n72\n \nTotal fixed income\n7,235\n \n19,115\n \n13\n \n—\n \n26,363\n \n61\n \n15,277\n \n297\n \n—\n \n15,635\n \nAlternatives\nHedge funds\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,603\n \n3,603\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n906\n \n906\n \nPrivate equity\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,093\n \n1,093\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n477\n \n477\n \nReal estate\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,406\n \n1,406\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n381\n \n381\n \nTotal alternatives\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6,102\n \n6,102\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,764\n \n1,764\n \nCash, cash equivalents, and repurchase agreements (b)\n(\n1,779\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1,779\n)\n(\n1,364\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1,364\n)\nOther (c)\n(\n649\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n649\n)\n(\n236\n)\n—\n \n3,841\n \n—\n \n3,605\n \nTotal assets at fair value \n$\n6,155\n \n$\n19,145\n \n$\n21\n \n$\n6,102\n \n$\n31,423\n \n$\n1,722\n \n$\n15,334\n \n$\n4,138\n \n$\n1,764\n \n$\n22,958\n \n__________\n(a)\nCertain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(b)\nPrimarily short-term investment funds to provide liquidity to plan investment managers and cash held to pay benefits, offset by repurchase agreements valued at $(\n2.7\n) billion in U.S. plans and $(\n1.8\n) billion in non-U.S. plans.\n(c)\nFor U.S. plans, amounts related to net pending security (purchases)/sales and net pending foreign currency purchases/(sales).

Many of our leases contain one or more options to extend.  In certain dealership lease agreements, we are the tenant and we sublease the site to a dealer.  In the event the sublease is terminated, we have the option to terminate the head lease.  We include options that we are reasonably certain to exercise in our evaluation of the lease term after considering all relevant economic and financial factors.\nLeases that are economically similar to the purchase of an asset are classified as finance leases.  The leased (“right-of-use”) assets in finance lease arrangements are reported in \nNet property\n on our consolidated balance sheets.  \nOtherwise, the leases are classified as operating leases and reported in \nOther assets\n in the non-current assets section of our consolidated balance sheets.  We also recognize in \nNet property\n “build-to-suit” arrangements during the construction period where we are involved in the construction or design of the asset and are considered the accounting owner.  We do not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of \n12\n months or less.  These lease payments are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  We have also entered into manufacturing contracts where Ford’s portion of the output is expected to be significant.  As a result, there are embedded leases, and related liabilities, that are reported as part of our financial statements, typically upon commencement of production.\nFor the majority of our leases, we do not separate the non-lease components (e.g., maintenance and operating services) from the lease components to which they relate.  Instead, non-lease components are included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.  However, we do separate lease and non-lease components for contracts containing a significant service component (e.g., energy performance contracts).  We calculate the initial lease liability as the present value of fixed payments not yet paid and variable payments that are based on a market rate or an index (e.g., CPI), measured at commencement.  The majority of our leases are discounted using our incremental borrowing rate because the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

The notes will not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the notes will not accrete.  The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting debt issuance costs, were approximately $\n2.267\n billion.\nEach $\n1,000\n principal amount of the notes will be convertible into \n70.1724\n shares of our Common Stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $\n14.25\n per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.  The notes are convertible, at the option of the noteholders, on or after December 15, 2025.  Prior to December 15, 2025, the notes are convertible only under the following circumstances:\n•\nDuring any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2021 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock for at least \n20\n trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of \n30\n consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to \n130\n% of the conversion price of the notes on each applicable trading day;\n•\nDuring the \nfive\n business day period after any \nfive\n consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $\n1,000\n principal amount of the notes for each day of that \nfive\n consecutive trading day period was less than \n98\n% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Common Stock and the conversion rate of the notes on such trading day; \n•\nIf we call any or all of the notes for redemption; or\n•\nUpon the occurrence of specific corporate events such as a change in control or certain beneficial distributions to common stockholders (as set forth in the indenture governing the notes).\nUpon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and cash, shares of our Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Common Stock, at our election for the remainder of our obligation in excess, if any, of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.  \nBeginning on or after March 20, 2024, we may redeem all or any portion of the notes for cash equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock has been at least \n130\n% of the conversion price then in effect for at least \n20\n trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any \n30\n consecutive trading day period.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change (e.g., change of control), subject to certain conditions, holders of the notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes.  In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date or if we issue a notice of redemption, we will increase the conversion rate by pre-defined amounts for holders who elect to convert their notes in connection with such a corporate event.  The conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert were not met in 2023 or 2024.\nThe notes were issued at par and fees associated with the issuance of these notes are amortized to \nInterest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit\n over the contractual term of the notes.  Amortization of issuance costs was $\n7\n million in 2022, 2023, and 2024.  The effective interest rate of the notes is \n0.3\n%.\nThe total estimated fair value of the notes as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 was approximately $\n2.3\n billion and $\n2.2\n billion, respectively.  The fair value was determined using commonly employed valuation methodologies applying observable market inputs and is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe notes did \nnot\n have an impact on our full year 2023 or 2024 diluted EPS.\n158\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 18.  DEBT AND COMMITMENTS \n(Continued)\nU.K. Export Finance Program\nIn 2020 and 2022, Ford Motor Company Limited (“Ford of Britain”), our operating subsidiary in the United Kingdom, entered into, and drew in full, £\n625\n million and £\n750\n million term loan credit facilities, respectively, with a syndicate of banks to support Ford of Britain’s general export activities.  Accordingly, U.K. Export Finance (“UKEF”) provided £\n500\n million and £\n600\n million guarantees of the credit facilities, respectively, under its Export Development Guarantee scheme, which supports high value commercial lending to U.K. exporters.  We have also guaranteed Ford of Britain’s obligations under the credit facilities to the lenders.  As of December 31, 2024, the full £\n1,375\n million under the two credit facilities remained outstanding.  These \nfive-year\n, non-amortizing loans mature on June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2027.\nCompany Excluding Ford Credit Facilities\nTotal Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2024 were $\n20.0\n billion, consisting of $\n13.5\n billion of our corporate credit facility, $\n2.0\n billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, $\n2.5\n billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and $\n2.0\n billion of local credit facilities.  At December 31, 2024, $\n1.7\n billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates, and the full amount under each of our corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit facilities was available.  \nLenders under our corporate credit facility have $\n25\n million of commitments maturing on April 26, 2026, $\n3.4\n billion of commitments maturing on April 22, 2027, $\n0.1\n billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2028, and $\n10.0\n billion of commitments maturing on April 20, 2029.  Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have $\n2.0\n billion of commitments maturing on April 22, 2027.  Lenders under our 364-day revolving credit facility have $\n2.5\n billion of commitments maturing on April 21, 2025.\nThe corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, carbon-free electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO\n2\n tailpipe emissions.  Prior to 2024, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO\n2\n tailpipe emissions; Ford outperformed all three of the sustainability-linked metrics for the most recent performance period.\nThe corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment.  The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of $\n4\n billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility.  If our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P, the guarantees of certain subsidiaries will be required.  The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility.  Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility.\nFord Credit Segment\nAsset-Backed Debt\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $\n60.4\n billion.  This secured debt is issued by Ford Credit and includes asset-backed securities used to fund operations and maintain liquidity.  Assets securing the related debt issued as part of all our securitization transactions are included in our consolidated results and are based upon the legal transfer of the underlying assets in order to reflect legal ownership and the beneficial ownership of the debt holder.  The third-party investors in the securitization transactions have legal recourse only to the assets securing the debt and do not have such recourse to us, except for the customary representation and warranty provisions or when we are counterparty to certain derivative transactions of the special purpose entities (“SPEs”).  In addition, the cash flows generated by the assets are restricted only to pay such liabilities; Ford Credit retains the right to residual cash flows.  See Note 23 for additional information.\n159\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 18.  DEBT AND COMMITMENTS \n(Continued)\nAlthough not contractually required, we regularly support our wholesale securitization programs by repurchasing receivables of a dealer from a SPE when the dealer’s performance is at risk, which transfers the corresponding risk of loss from the SPE to us.  In order to continue to fund the wholesale receivables, we also may contribute additional cash or wholesale receivables if the collateral falls below required levels.  The balance of cash related to these contributions was $\n0\n at both December 31, 2023 and 2024 and ranged from $\n0\n to $\n41\n million during 2023 and was $\n0\n during 2024.  \nSPEs that are exposed to interest rate or currency risk may reduce their risks by entering into derivative transactions. In certain instances, we have entered into derivative transactions with the counterparty to protect the counterparty from risks absorbed through derivative transactions with the SPEs.  Derivative income/(expense) related to the derivative transactions that support Ford Credit’s securitization programs were $\n466\n million, $\n39\n million, and $\n56\n million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.

To manage these risks, we enter into highly effective derivative contracts:\n•\nForeign currency exchange contracts, including forwards, that are used to manage foreign exchange exposure;  \n•\nCommodity contracts, including forwards, that are used to manage commodity price risk;  \n•\nInterest rate contracts, including swaps, that are used to manage the effects of interest rate fluctuations; and  \n•\nCross-currency interest rate swap contracts that are used to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures on foreign-denominated debt.  \nOur derivatives are over-the-counter customized derivative transactions and are not exchange-traded.  We review our hedging program, derivative positions, and overall risk management strategy on a regular basis. \nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting.  \nDerivative assets are reported in \nOther assets\n and derivative liabilities are reported in \nPayables\n and \nOther liabilities and deferred revenue.\nWe have elected to apply hedge accounting to certain derivatives.  Derivatives that are designated in hedging relationships are evaluated for effectiveness using regression analysis at the time they are designated and throughout the hedge period.  Some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting; for others, we elect not to apply hedge accounting. \nCash Flow Hedges.  \nWe have designated certain forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions with exposure to foreign currency exchange and commodity price risks.\nChanges in the fair value of cash flow hedges are deferred in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) \nand are recognized in \nCost of sales\n when the hedged item affects earnings.  Our policy is to de-designate foreign currency exchange cash flow hedges prior to the time forecasted transactions are recognized as assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and report subsequent changes in fair value through \nCost of sales\n.  If it becomes probable that the originally forecasted transaction will not occur, the related amount included in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) \nis reclassified and recognized in earnings.  The cash flows associated with hedges designated until maturity are reported in \nNet cash provided by/(used in) operating activities\n on our consolidated statements of cash flows.  Our cash flow hedges mature within \nthree years\n.\nFair Value Hedges.  \nOur Ford Credit segment uses derivatives to reduce the risk of changes in the fair value of debt.  We have designated certain receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt.  The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate and foreign exchange.  We report the change in fair value of the hedged debt related to the change in benchmark interest rate in \nFord Credit debt\n and \nFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses\n.\n \nWe report the change in fair value of the hedged debt related to foreign currency in \nFord Credit debt \nand\n \nOther income/(loss), net\n.  \nNet interest settlements and accruals and fair value changes on hedging instruments due to the benchmark interest rate change are reported in \nFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses\n.  We report the change in fair value of the hedging instrument related to foreign currency in \nOther income/(loss), net.  \nThe cash flows associated with fair value hedges are reported in \nNet cash provided by/(used in) operating activities\n on our consolidated statements of cash flows. \nWhen a fair value hedge is de-designated, or when the derivative is terminated before maturity, the fair value adjustment to the hedged debt continues to be reported as part of the carrying value of the debt and is recognized in \nFord Credit interest, operating, and other expenses\n over its remaining life.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments.\n  For total Company excluding Ford Credit, we report changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments through \nCost of sales\n.  Cash flows associated with non-designated or de-designated derivatives are reported in \nNet cash provided by/(used in) investing activities\n on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nOur Ford Credit segment reports the gains/(losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in \nOther income/(loss), net\n.  Cash flows associated with non-designated or de-designated derivatives are reported in \nNet cash provided by/(used in) investing activities\n on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n  \n161\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 19.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\n (Continued)\nNormal Purchases and Normal Sales Classification.  \nWe have elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales classification for physical supply contracts that are entered into for the purpose of procuring commodities to be used in production over a reasonable period in the normal course of our business.\nIncome Effect of Derivative Financial Instruments \nThe gains/(losses), by hedge designation, reported in income for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in millions):\n \n2022\n2023\n2024\nCash flow hedges\nReclassified from AOCI to Cost of sales\nForeign currency exchange contracts (a)\n$\n(\n213\n)\n$\n145\n \n$\n46\n \nCommodity contracts (b)\n133\n \n(\n62\n)\n(\n38\n)\nFair value hedges\nInterest rate contracts\nNet interest settlements and accruals on hedging instruments\n(\n45\n)\n(\n507\n)\n(\n361\n)\nFair value changes on hedging instruments\n(\n1,875\n)\n196\n \n(\n220\n)\nFair value changes on hedged debt\n1,893\n \n(\n260\n)\n182\n \nCross-currency interest rate swap contracts\nNet interest settlements and accruals on hedging instruments\n(\n27\n)\n(\n79\n)\n(\n133\n)\nFair value changes on hedging instruments\n(\n111\n)\n96\n \n(\n134\n)\nFair value changes on hedged debt\n113\n \n(\n96\n)\n108\n \nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nForeign currency exchange contracts (c)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n38\n)\n384\n \nCross-currency interest rate swap contracts\n(\n780\n)\n127\n \n(\n272\n)\nInterest rate contracts\n390\n \n37\n \n(\n85\n)\nCommodity contracts\n(\n51\n)\n(\n49\n)\n(\n48\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n576\n)\n$\n(\n490\n)\n$\n(\n571\n)\n__________\n(a)\nFor 2022, 2023, and 2024, a $\n448\n million gain, a $\n482\n million loss, and an $\n808\n million gain, respectively, were reported in \nOther comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax\n.\n(b)\nFor 2022, 2023, and 2024, a $\n102\n million loss, a $\n37\n million loss, and a $\n5\n million loss, respectively, were reported in \nOther comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax\n.\n(c)\nFor 2022, 2023, and 2024, a $\n53\n million loss, a $\n3\n million loss, and a $\n116\n million gain, respectively, were reported in \nCost of sales\n and a $\n50\n million gain, a $\n35\n million loss, and a $\n268\n million gain\n \nwere reported in\n Other income/(loss), net,\n respectively.\n \n162\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 19.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\n (Continued)\nBalance Sheet Effect of Derivative Financial Instruments \nDerivative assets and liabilities are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and are presented on a gross basis.

We record costs associated with involuntary separation programs when management has approved the plan for separation, the affected employees are identified, and it is unlikely that actions required to complete the separation plan will change significantly.  Costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period.\nCompany Excluding Ford Credit \nEmployee separation actions and exit and disposal activities include employee separation costs, facility and other asset-related charges (e.g., impairment, accelerated depreciation), dealer and supplier payments, other statutory and contractual obligations, and other expenses, which are recorded in \nCost of sales \nand \nSelling, administrative, and other expenses\n.\n  Below are actions we have initiated:\n•\nBrazil.\n  Exited manufacturing operations in 2021 resulting in the closure of facilities in Camaçari, Taubaté, and Troller.  Sales of the Taubaté and Camaçari plants were completed in 2023\n•\nIndia.\n  Ceased vehicle manufacturing in Sanand in the fourth quarter of 2021 and ceased manufacturing in Chennai in the third quarter of 2022.  A sale of the Sanand vehicle assembly and powertrain plants was completed in the first quarter of 2023 (See Note 21)\n•\nSpain. \n Ceased production of the Mondeo at the Valencia plant in the first quarter of 2022\n•\nChina. \n Ceased development of certain product programs in 2023\n•\nGermany.\n  Production of the Focus will cease at our Saarlouis Body and Assembly Plant in 2025.  Our plan is to repurpose the facility into a technology center, retaining 1,000 positions\nIn addition, we are continuing to reduce our global workforce and take other restructuring actions, including the separation of salaried workers as announced during 2023 and 2024 and separation packages offered to certain members of our hourly workforce during 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for the years ended December 31, which are recorded in \nOther liabilities and deferred revenue \n(in millions):\n2023\n2024\nBeginning balance\n$\n588\n \n$\n1,086\n \nChanges in accruals (a)\n1,600\n \n973\n \nPayments\n(\n1,030\n)\n(\n871\n)\nForeign currency translation and other\n(\n72\n)\n(\n90\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n1,086\n \n$\n1,098\n \n__________\n(a)    Excludes pension costs of $\n268\n million and $\n218\n million in 2023 and 2024, respectively.\nWe recorded costs of $\n1.9\n billion and $\n1.2\n billion in 2023 and 2024, respectively, related to the initiated actions above.  We estimate that we will incur about $\n500\n million in total charges in 2025 related to such actions, primarily attributable to employee separations; some charges are related to plans that are subject to negotiations with a works council, union, or other social partner.  In addition, we continue to review our global businesses and may take additional restructuring actions where a path to sustained profitability is not feasible when considering the capital allocation required for those businesses.\n164\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 21.\n \nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n \nCompany Excluding Ford Credit\nFord Sales and Service Korea Company (“FSSK”). \n In the first quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell 100% of our equity interest in FSSK, and the entity was classified as held for sale.  We determined the assets held for sale were not impaired.  However, as of December 31, 2024, FSSK no longer met the held-for-sale criteria as that sale transaction did not close and is no longer probable of occurring.  Accordingly, FSSK’s assets and liabilities were reclassified and reported as held and used as of December 31, 2024.  As the assets previously held for sale were not impaired, no adjustments were required as a result of the reclassification to held and used.  \nFord Motor Company A/S (“Denmark”)\n.  In the third quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell 100% of our equity interest in Denmark.  The entity was classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2024 once all criteria were met.  Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, we reported $\n52\n million of held-for-sale assets, including $\n47\n million of cash, and $\n33\n million of held-for-sale liabilities in \nOther assets\n and \nOther liabilities,\n respectively.  We determined the assets held for sale were not impaired.  On January 2, 2025, we completed the sale of Denmark.  The consideration received approximated the carrying value of Denmark at the time of sale.  \nAuto Motive Power (“AMP”).\n  In the fourth quarter of 2023, we acquired AMP, a California-based energy management startup focused on electric vehicle charging solutions.  Assets acquired primarily include goodwill and technology, which are reported in \nOther assets\n.  The acquisition did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  \nSanand, India (“Sanand”) Plants.\n  In the third quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Sanand vehicle assembly and powertrain plants to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited (“Tata”), a subsidiary of Tata Motors Limited.  The sale transaction included the land, buildings, and other fixed assets (excluding the powertrain machinery and equipment) for the plants.  We recognized, in \nCost of sales\n, pre-tax impairment charges of $\n32\n million in the third quarter of 2022 to adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair value less costs to sell.  We determined fair value using the market approach, based on the negotiated value of the assets.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of the plants to Tata.  Ford continues to operate the powertrain facility by leasing back the associated land and building.  As a result of the sale transaction, we derecognized the fixed assets and recognized the powertrain facility operating lease right-of-use asset and related lease liability in the first quarter of 2023.  The fair value of the cash consideration received approximated the carrying value of the fixed assets at the time of sale.\nFord Romania S.R.L. (“Ford Romania”). \n On July 1, 2022, we completed the sale of Ford Romania, our wholly-owned Romanian manufacturing subsidiary, to Ford Otosan, a joint venture in which Ford has a \n41\n% ownership share.  The transaction resulted in deconsolidation of our Ford Romania subsidiary in the third quarter of 2022.  The fair value of consideration received, consisting of cash and a note receivable, approximated the carrying value of Ford Romania at the time of sale.  The Ford Romania plant in Craiova, Romania continues to manufacture Ford-branded vehicles for Ford and Ford Otosan.  Ford’s portion of the output is expected to be significant; as a result, at the time of sale there were about $\n100\n million of assets, such as embedded leases, and related liabilities that continue to be reported as part of our financial statements.\nSkinny Labs Inc., dba Spin (“Spin”).\n  On April 1, 2022, we completed the sale of Spin, our wholly-owned micro-mobility provider, to TIER Mobility SE, a German-based micro-mobility provider, which resulted in the deconsolidation of our Spin subsidiary in the second quarter of 2022.

We consolidate VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary.  We consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  Assets recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets.  Liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional claims on our general assets; rather, they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated VIEs.\nWe have the power to direct the significant activities of an entity when our management has the ability to make key operating decisions, such as decisions regarding budgets, capital investment, manufacturing, or product development.  For securitization entities, we have the power to direct significant activities when we have the ability to exercise discretion in the servicing of financial assets, issue additional debt, exercise a unilateral call option, add assets to revolving structures, or control investment decisions.\nVIEs of Which We are Not the Primary Beneficiary\nCertain of our affiliates are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary.  Our maximum exposure to any potential losses associated with these unconsolidated affiliates is limited to our equity investments, accounts receivable, loans, and guarantees\n and was $\n3.7\n billion and $\n9.3\n billion at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  The guarantee exposure is related to certain debt at our unconsolidated affiliates, which includes amounts outstanding as well as potential future draws up to a maximum amount of $\n125\n million and $\n4.9\n billion at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, related to certain obligations of our VIEs, and is also included in Note 24. \nIn July 2022, Ford, SK On Co., Ltd., and SK Battery America, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of SK On) completed the creation of BlueOval SK, LLC (“BOSK”), a 50/\n50\n joint venture that is building and will operate electric vehicle battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky to supply batteries to Ford and Ford affiliates.  BOSK is a VIE of which we are not the primary beneficiary, and we use the equity method of accounting for our investment.  In December 2024, BOSK entered into a loan agreement with the United States Department of Energy (“DOE”) of up to $\n9.6\n billion (the “BOSK DOE Loan”).  In conjunction with the loan agreement, Ford has agreed to guarantee its \n50\n% share of BOSK’s payment obligations under the BOSK DOE Loan.  After its initial draw on the BOSK DOE Loan, BOSK distributed $\n1.4\n billion to Ford as a return of capital.  As of December 31, 2024, Ford has recognized contributions (net of returns of capital) to BOSK of $\n4.1\n billion of its agreed capital contribution of up to $\n6.6\n billion through 2026.  The total amount of capital contributions is subject to adjustments agreed to by the parties.\nIn January 2025, BOSK distributed an additional $\n1.7\n billion to Ford as a return of capital, resulting in recognized contributions (net of returns of capital) to BOSK of $\n2.4\n billion of its agreed capital contribution of up to $\n6.6\n billion through 2026.  \nVIEs of Which We are the Primary Beneficiary\nSecuritization Entities.  \nThrough Ford Credit, we securitize, transfer, and service financial assets associated with consumer finance receivables, operating leases, and wholesale loans.  Our securitization transactions typically involve the legal transfer of financial assets to bankruptcy remote SPEs.  We generally retain a portion of the economic interests in the asset-backed securitization transactions, which could be retained in the form of a portion of the senior interests, the subordinated interests, cash reserve accounts, residual interests, and servicing rights.  The transfers of assets in our securitization transactions do not qualify for accounting sale treatment.  In most cases, the bankruptcy remote SPEs meet the definition of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary and, therefore, are consolidated.  \nWe account for all securitization transactions as if they were secured financing and therefore the assets, liabilities, and related activity of these transactions are consolidated in our financial statements.  See Note 18 for additional information on the accounting for asset-backed debt and the assets securing this debt.\n \n167\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 24.  \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \nCommitments and contingencies primarily consist of guarantees and indemnifications, litigation and claims, and warranty and field service actions.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\nFinancial Guarantees.  \nFinancial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception. Subsequent to initial recognition, the guarantee liability is adjusted at each reporting period to reflect the current estimate of expected payments resulting from possible default events over the remaining life of the guarantee.\n  The maximum potential payments for financial guarantees were $\n535\n million and $\n5,336\n million at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  See Note 23 for additional information.  The carrying value of recorded liabilities related to financial guarantees was $\n59\n million and $\n144\n million at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  \nOur financial guarantees consist of debt and lease obligations of certain joint ventures, as well as certain financial obligations of outside third parties, including suppliers, to support our business and economic growth.  Expiration dates vary through 2040, and guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the underlying obligation.  A payment by us would be triggered by failure of the joint venture or other third party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee.  In some circumstances, we are entitled to recover from a third party amounts paid by us under the guarantee.\nNon-Financial Guarantees.\n  Non-financial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception.  We regularly review our performance risk under these arrangements, and in the event it becomes probable we will be required to perform under a guarantee or indemnity, the amount of probable payment is recorded.\n  The maximum potential payments and carrying values of recorded liabilities related to non-financial guarantees were de minimis at both December 31, 2023 and 2024.  \nIn the ordinary course of business, we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction, such as the sale of a business.  These indemnifications might include and are not limited to claims relating to any of the following:  environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; power generation contracts; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships; and financial matters, such as securitizations.  Performance under these indemnities generally would be triggered by a breach of contract claim brought by a counterparty, including a joint venture or alliance partner, or a third-party claim.  While some of these indemnifications are limited in nature, many of them do not limit potential payment.  Therefore, we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of future payments that could result from claims made under these unlimited indemnities.\n168\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 24.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n(Continued)\nLitigation and Claims\nVarious legal actions, proceedings, and claims (generally, “matters”) are pending or may be instituted or asserted against us.  These include, but are not limited to, matters arising out of alleged defects in our products; product warranties; governmental regulations relating to safety, emissions, and fuel economy or other matters; government incentives; tax matters, including trade and customs; alleged illegal acts resulting in fines or penalties; financial services; employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other contractual relationships; intellectual property rights; environmental matters; shareholder or investor matters; and financial reporting matters.  Certain of the pending legal actions are, or purport to be, class actions.  Some of the matters involve or may involve claims for compensatory, punitive, or antitrust or other treble damages in very large amounts, or demands for field service actions, environmental remediation programs, sanctions, loss of government incentives, assessments, or other relief, which, if granted, would require very large expenditures. \nThe extent of our financial exposure to these matters is difficult to estimate.  Many matters do not specify a dollar amount for damages, and many others specify only a jurisdictional minimum.  To the extent an amount is asserted, our historical experience suggests that in most instances the amount asserted is not a reliable indicator of the ultimate outcome.\nWe accrue for matters when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable.  In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood that we will prevail, and the severity of any potential loss.  We reevaluate and update our accruals as matters progress over time.\nFor the majority of matters, which generally arise out of alleged defects in our products, we establish an accrual based on our extensive historical experience with similar matters.  We do not believe there is a reasonably possible outcome materially in excess of our accrual for these matters.  \nFor the remaining matters, where our historical experience with similar matters is of more limited value (i.e., “non-pattern matters”), we evaluate the matters primarily based on the individual facts and circumstances.  For non-pattern matters, we evaluate whether there is a reasonable possibility of a material loss in excess of any accrual that can be estimated. \n Our estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of our accruals for all material matters currently reflects indirect tax and regulatory matters, for which we estimate the aggregate risk to be a range of up to about $\n0.4\n billion.\nAs noted, the litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance.  Our assessments are based on our knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any matter could require payment substantially in excess of the amount that we have accrued and/or disclosed.\n169\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 24.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n(Continued)\nWarranty and Field Service Actions\nWe accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale.  We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.  We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year.  In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance.  Warranty and field service action obligations are reported in \nOther liabilities and deferred revenue\n.  We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis.  \nWe recognize the benefit from a recovery of the costs associated with our warranty and field service actions when specifics of the recovery have been agreed with our supplier and the amount of recovery is virtually certain.  Recoveries are reported in \nTrade and other receivables, net\n and\n Other assets.\nThe estimate of our future warranty and field service action costs, net of estimated supplier recoveries, for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in millions):\n \n2023\n2024\nBeginning balance\n$\n9,193\n \n$\n11,504\n \nPayments made during the period\n(\n4,779\n)\n(\n5,831\n)\nChanges in accrual related to warranties issued during the period\n4,743\n \n6,294\n \nChanges in accrual related to pre-existing warranties\n2,648\n \n2,690\n \nForeign currency translation and other\n(\n301\n)\n(\n625\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n11,504\n \n$\n14,032\n \nChanges to our estimated costs are reported as changes in accrual related to pre-existing warranties in the table above.  In addition, our estimate of reasonably possible costs in excess of our accruals for material field service actions and customer satisfaction actions is a range of up to about $\n1.8\n billion in the aggregate.\n \n \n170\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 25.  \nSEGMENT INFORMATION \nWe report segment information consistent with the way our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), our President and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the operating results and performance of the Company.   Accordingly, for 2024, we analyze the results of our business through the following reportable segments:  Ford Blue, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Next, and Ford Credit.  \nBelow is a description of our reportable segments and other activities.\nFord Blue Segment\nFord Blue primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln internal combustion engine (“ICE”) and hybrid vehicles, service parts, accessories, and digital services for retail customers, together with the associated costs of development, manufacture, and distribution of the vehicles, parts, accessories, and services.  This segment focuses on developing Ford and Lincoln ICE and hybrid vehicles.  Additionally, this segment provides hardware engineering and manufacturing capabilities to Ford Model e and manufactures vehicles on behalf of Ford Pro and, in certain cases, Ford Model e.  Ford Blue also includes:\n•\nAll sales for markets not presently in scope for Ford Model e or Ford Pro (as further described below)\n•\nIn markets outside of the United States and Canada, sales to commercial, government, and rental customers of ICE and hybrid vehicles not considered core to Ford Pro\n•\nSales of electric vehicles (“EVs”) by our unconsolidated affiliates in China\n•\nAll sales of vehicles manufactured and sold to other OEMs\nFord Model e Segment\nFord Model e primarily includes the sale of our electric vehicles, service parts, accessories, and digital services for retail customers, together with the associated costs of development, manufacture, and distribution of the vehicles, parts, accessories, and services.  This segment focuses on developing EV and digital vehicle technologies, as well as software development.  Additionally, Ford Model e provides software and connected vehicle technologies on behalf of the enterprise, and manufactures certain EVs, including for Ford Pro.  Ford Model e operates in North America, Europe, and China.  Ford Model e also includes EV and related sales not considered core to Ford Pro to commercial, government, and rental customers in Europe, China, and Mexico.\nFord Pro Segment\nFord Pro primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles, service parts, accessories, and services for commercial, government, and rental customers.  Included in this segment are sales of all core Ford Pro vehicles, such as Super Duty and the Transit range of vans in North America and Europe and all sales of Ranger in Europe.  In the United States and Canada, Ford Pro also includes all vehicle sales to commercial, government, and rental customers.  This segment focuses on selling ICE, hybrid, and electric vehicles, and providing digital and physical services to optimize and maintain fleets, including telematics and EV charging solutions.  This segment reflects external sales of vehicles produced by Ford Blue and Ford Model e and the costs (including intersegment markup) associated with acquiring vehicles for sale and providing services.  Ford Pro operates in North America and Europe.\nFord Next Segment\nThe Ford Next segment primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in vehicle-adjacent market segments. \nFord Credit Segment\nThe Ford Credit segment is comprised of the Ford Credit business on a consolidated basis, which is primarily vehicle-related financing and leasing activities.\n171\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 25.  SEGMENT INFORMATION \n(Continued)\nCorporate Other\nCorporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract \nportfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending.  Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments.  These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company’s interests.  Corporate Other assets include:  cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, tax related assets, defined benefit pension plan net assets, and other assets managed centrally.\nInterest on Debt\nInterest on Debt is presented as a separate reconciling item and consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit.  \nSpecial Items\nSpecial Items are presented as a separate reconciling item.  They consist of (i) pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses, (ii) gains and losses on investments in equity securities, (iii) significant personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, and (iv) other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities.  Our management ordinarily excludes these items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources.  We also report these special items separately to help investors track amounts related to these activities and to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results.   \nCODM Evaluation of the Business\nWhen we report segment earnings before interest and taxes (“Segment EBIT”) for each of the Ford Blue, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, and Ford Next segments, it consists of the earnings for the particular segment and does not include interest and taxes.  Ford Credit segment earnings include interest and exclude taxes (“Segment EBT”).  Each segment’s EBIT/EBT also excludes the results reported in Corporate Other and Special Items.  For the Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments, our CODM reviews Segment EBIT and Segment EBIT margin, as well as market share, revenue, and wholesale volume to evaluate performance and allocate resources, predominately in the budgeting, planning, and forecasting processes.  For Segment EBIT, our CODM reviews the year-over-year change in EBIT, sequential change in EBIT, and change in EBIT from internal forecasts/budgets.  Revenue and certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of vehicles.  As a result, our CODM reviews the EBIT impact driven by changes in volume and mix, the EBIT impact driven by changes in exchange, and the EBIT impact driven by changes in net pricing and cost categories at constant volume and mix and/or exchange.  For the Ford Next segment, our CODM reviews segment EBIT to evaluate performance.  For the Ford Credit segment, our CODM reviews Segment EBT to evaluate performance and allocate resources.  Expense information is provided to and reviewed by the CODM on a consolidated basis to evaluate cost efficiency and company level performance.  \n172\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 25.  SEGMENT INFORMATION \n(Continued)\nSegment Revenue, Cost, and Asset Principles for Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro\nExternal vehicle and digital services revenue is generally vehicle-specific and included in the segment responsible for the external vehicle sale.  A majority of parts and accessories revenue and cost is attributed to customer sales channels or vehicle lines based on recent end customer sales and is included in the respective segment.\nIn the normal course of business, Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro transact between segments and cooperate to leverage synergies, including developing and manufacturing vehicles on behalf of another segment.  When one segment produces a vehicle that is sold externally by another segment, an intersegment transaction occurs.  The producing segment will report intersegment revenue to recoup the costs associated with the unit produced.  This includes material cost, labor and overhead (including depreciation and amortization), inbound freight, and an intersegment markup.  The intersegment markup amount is set to deliver a competitive return to the producing segment for its manufacturing and distribution service.  Costs are reflected in the associated segment externally reporting the vehicle sale, as detailed in the table below: \nIncome Statement Elements\nExamples\nSegment Reporting\nCosts specific to a particular vehicle\nBill of material cost and initial warranty accrual\nReported in the segment externally selling the vehicle\nCosts identifiable by product line\nManufacturing and logistics costs, depreciation & amortization expense, direct research & development costs\nTypically identifiable to the product line or production location.  Reported in the segment externally selling the vehicle, based on relative volume\nShared costs\nSelling, general & administrative expense, and indirect/cross product line research & development costs\nTypically shared across all segments, generally based on relative volume.  Certain costs clearly linked to a segment are reported in the specific segment\nIntersegment markup for intersegment vehicle transactions\nContract manufacturing and distribution fees\nReported in the segment externally selling the vehicle, for each applicable vehicle transaction\nAssets are reported in each segment, aligned to the appropriate operational responsibility.  Manufacturing assets, e.g., our plants and the machinery and equipment therein, are included in our Ford Blue and Ford Model e segments.  Manufacturing assets producing only, or primarily, EVs and related components are reflected in Ford Model e.  Manufacturing assets that support the production of ICE and hybrid vehicles, including those producing ICE and electric in the same facility, are included in Ford Blue.  Vendor tooling dedicated to producing EV parts is reported in Ford Model e.  \nPurchased regulatory credit compliance assets are reported in Ford Blue.  There are no Ford manufacturing, vendor tooling, or regulatory credit compliance assets reported in Ford Pro.  Depreciation and amortization expense is reflected on the basis of production volume.  Regulatory compliance credit expense is allocated by vehicle line between Ford Blue and Ford Pro segments.  Regardless of the segment reporting the asset, the related expenses are reported in the segment that reports the external vehicle sale.\nEquity in net income/(loss) of affiliated companies\n is included in \nIncome/(Loss) before income taxes\n, based primarily on which segment the entity supports or has the majority of the entity’s purchases or sales.  The table below shows the segment reporting for our most significant unconsolidated entities:\nFord Blue\nFord Model e\nFord Pro\n∘  Changan Ford Automobile Corporation, Ltd.
