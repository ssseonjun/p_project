  "item1_summary": " The following is only a summary of the principal risks that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky . The risk factors section should be carefully considered in full, in addition to other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n Demand for and sales of travel services often decline during periods of perceived or actual adverse economic conditions . Economic and political uncertainty can negatively impact transaction growth rates, cancellation rates, and accommodation average daily rates . Other events beyond our control such as pandemics, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, wars and regional hostilities, travel-related accidents, or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel .\n Some of the world's most popular online travel destinations could be affected by changes to the way they use Google Maps . Google Maps could be used to help people find out what to do with their travel plans . The company says it is working to develop a better way to communicate with the world through the use of Google Maps and other services .\n mpete, and our business and results of operations, would be adversely affected . We currently, or may in the future, compete with companies that provide a variety of products and services . Some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us .\n A competitor that has established other, more frequent online or app-based interactions with consumers may be able to more easily or cost-effectively acquire customers for its online travel services than we can . In some cases, our competitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction or offer travel services at a loss in order to gain market share .\n We face risks related to the growth rate and the global expansion of our business . Our OTC operations outside of the United States historically had achieved significant year-over-year growth in their gross bookings . Any decline in the growth rates of our businesses could negatively impact our revenue and earnings growth rates and as a consequence our stock price .\n We believe that the breadth, variety, and quality of accommodations on our platforms helps drive our growth . In some markets such as China, local requirements may restrict participation by foreign businesses, making our entry into and expansion in those markets costly, difficult, or impossible . If we are unsuccessful in expanding in new and existing markets and managing that expansion, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected .\n A significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service providers, or restaurants, for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal from our services, could have an adverse effect on our business, advertising revenue, market share, and results of operations . A decline or slowing growth in travel search traffic also negatively impacts our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platforms .\n We rely on various third-party distribution channels (i.e., marketing affiliates) to distribute accommodation, rental car, and airline ticket reservations . Our business and reputation may be adversely affected if such providers no longer make such offerings available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all . Alternative accommodations are subject to claims of liability based on injury, death, discrimination, or criminal activities .\n We rely on property owners to disclose information relating to their listings and such information may be inaccurate or incomplete . Booking.com facilitates the provision of partner liability insurance that may protect alternative accommodation partners against liability claims, lawsuits by third parties for bodily injury, or personal property damage that occur during a stay at a partner property . Any resulting complaints or claims could result in negative publicity and increased costs .\n Legal requirements for alternative accommodations are evolving and can be inconsistent among individual localities . Performance marketing costs to grow traffic to our platforms are variable because they are dependent on others' marketing spend in the same channels . If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands, our market share could be materially adversely affected .\n We compete in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent service developments, and changing consumer preferences . Negative trends in our marketing efficiency, performance marketing ROIs, or consumer shopping activity could negatively impact our business, market share, and results of operations . We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes .\n Development of the Connected Trip is subject to uncertainties, including further development of the verticals and technological capabilities . Other companies, including emerging start-ups or large technology companies, may be able to innovate and focus on developing a new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new services or technologies before we do .\n The revenues earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a desktop transaction due to different purchasing patterns . To the extent mobile devices or platforms enable users to block advertising content, our advertising revenue and ability to market our brands may also be negatively affected . If we are unable to offer consumers their preferred method of payment, it would limit our growth opportunities and our results of business could be affected .\n If we don't have sufficient AI technology, we could be at risk for our future . We may have to rely on the performance of highly skilled workers . We need to be able to make sure we have the right to work with the best in the world . We are committed to the future of the world's most powerful AI technology .\n Competition for well-qualified employees, especially software engineers and other technology professionals, is intense and costly . Our ability to attract and retain talent could be negatively impacted by factors such as the recently announced organizational changes, including an expected workforce reduction, and our hybrid work environment . Our customer service resources (including outsource arrangements) may be unable to provide adequate customer service support .\n Future events and changing market conditions may result in the need to recognize goodwill, investment, or asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations . We could experience a high level of cancellations of existing reservations which could result in higher than normal cash outlays to refund consumers for prepaid reservations . We may also offer cancellable room rates on behalf of a partner to provide flexibility to our consumers .\n e may also incur significant charges related to the Transformation Program, which could reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred . Any future expansion or shift increases the complexity of our business and places additional strain on our management, operations, technical performance, financial resources, and administrative, legal, tax, internal controls, and financial reporting functions .\n Investments in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated . Such endeavors may not be successful, such as our agreement to acquire European-based flights booking provider Etraveli Group that was terminated after the EC blocked the transaction in 2023 . Entering new businesses involves risks and costs that could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, profit margins, cash flows or financial condition .\n We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or manage the operation of our internal businesses . We may decide to make minority investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have limited or no management or operational control . The integration of acquired businesses requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully . These actions are complex, costly, and create a variety of risks .\n We depend on software and computing infrastructure (including open source software) for the operation of our business . Cyberattacks evolving and increasing in frequency and sophistication, we may not be able to successfully defend against determined adversaries . We have experienced and responded to cyberattacks, which we believe have not had a material impact on the integrity of our systems .\n Booking.com: Security breaches could lead to information loss, reputational harm, monetary damages, regulatory penalties, or loss of a competitive advantage . Security breach could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and liability, subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions, or cause consumers to lose confidence in us and choose to use services of our competitors .\n We invest significant resources to comply with regulations such as the European Union's (the EU) General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") and the California Consumer Privacy Act . Non-compliance with these laws could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation, significant penalties, or other legal liability . Cyberattacks, system vulnerabilities, or inadequate system capacity could lead to sustained service outages, data loss, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position .\n We are dependent on the internet, connectivity, and mobile systems throughout the world . Disruptions in internet access could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations . We seek to improve the reliability and redundancy of our systems, however, these steps are expensive, may reduce our margins, and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime .\n Our existing security measures have not always been, and in the future may not be, successful in preventing attacks on our systems . Cyberattacks may go undetected for a period of time resulting in harm to our computer systems . This could result in regulatory fines, loss of consumers or partners, and reputational harm, among other costs .\n If critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we may need to repair, expand, replace, or upgrade our systems or infrastructure . Many of our processes and systems are highly automated and involve multiple inputs from various IT systems, which can mitmit the risk of human error but can also make testing, troubleshooting, and auditing more difficult .\n Some of our business is conducted with third-party marketing affiliates, which may generate travel reservations through our infrastructure or through other systems . A security breach at any third party that we conduct business with could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our systems . If any such third party were compromised or ceased or suspended operations, our cash flows could be disrupted .\n The final determination of tax audits or disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals . An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation or audit proceedings could encourage the commencement of additional litigation, audit proceedings, or other regulatory inquiries . The U.S.'s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act introduced a tax on 50% of global intangible low-taxed income .\n The Tax Act introduced a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (\"BEAT\") aimed at preventing the erosion of the U.S. tax base and a new tax deduction with respect to certain foreign-derived intangible income . If we are unable to operate our business so that BEAT does not impact us, our effective tax rate, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected .\n There have been significant changes made and proposed to international tax laws that increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance . We are also subject to other non-income-based taxes, such as value-added, payroll, sales, use, excise, net worth, property, hotel occupancy, and goods and services . The implementation of these rules could have a negative impact on our results of operations .\n A number of jurisdictions in the U.S. have initiated lawsuits or other proceedings against OTCs, including us, related to payment of certain travel transaction taxes . Jurisdictions could also seek to collect such taxes, either retroactively, prospectively, or both . Although we believe we do not owe the taxes claimed, litigation is uncertain, litigation could result in liabilities for past and/or future bookings .\n Dutch tax law provides that income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at the rate of 9% rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25.8% . A portion of Booking.com's earnings historically has qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment . The loss or reduction of the \"Innovation Box Tax benefit\" could substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations .\n As we expand our business into new areas, including building the Connected Trip vision, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations . We are involved in investigations related to whether certain of Booking.com's contractual parity arrangements with accommodation providers are anti-competitive . We cooperate with regulators but we are unable to predict what, if any, effect any in .\n An unfavorable outcome in an investigation could encourage additional regulatory inquiries that could become widespread over time . These types of investigations can result and have resulted in the assessment of fines, private litigation, and negative publicity . There is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry, especially as technology companies become larger . In some instances countries have passed legislation that goes further to restrict business activities .\n The EC desi regulates the relationship between online platforms such as Booking.com and European business users of online platforms . The DMA and DSA give regulators in the EU more instruments to investigate and regulate digital businesses and impose additional rules and requirements on platforms designated as \"gatekeepers\" under the DMA .\n VLOPs based on a platform's number of EU \"monthly active recipients\" (\"MARs\") The EC requires counting users who display and to whom information was displayed (e.g., partners and consumers) New state and federal laws and regulations could impact our services, require us to change our business practices, and impose additional complexity and costs .\n In some of our contracts, we or the other party have agreed to restrictions on certain key search terms related to each other . If those restrictions are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, it could negatively impact our performance . For example, in some countries, laws relating to data localization, and other local requirements could, if applicable to us, could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those countries .\n The Package Travel Directive and other local laws governing the sale of travel services (the \"Package Directive\") set out broad requirements such as local registration, certain mandatory financial guarantees, disclosure requirements, and other rules regulating the provision of single travel sales, travel packages, and linked travel arrangements . Compliance with this directive could be costly and complex and, as a result of its requirements, we could choose to limit offerings that would otherwise be beneficial .\n U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act, DSA and DMA, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials or third parties . Violations of these laws and regulations have resulted and in the future could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees . If these restrictions are not applicable to competitors, it may provide them a competitive advantage .\n There are various risks associated with the facilitation of payments, including risks related to fraud, compliance with evolving rules and regulations, and reliance on third parties . Our results have been and will likely continue to be negatively impacted by consumer purchases made using fraudulent payment cards, claims the consumer did not authorize the purchase, or consumers who have closed bank accounts .\n If we are unable to successfully implement and evolve measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud on our platforms, our business, profit margins, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected . As a greater percentage of our transactions involve us processing payments, our global systems and processes must be managed on a larger scale .\n Regulators (or we) may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to laws that govern payments activities, such as money transmission and online payments processing, which could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in certain jurisdictions . Failure to maintain compliance with applicable licensing, payment services, customer fund safeguarding, or related regulations could lead to fines .\n If we fail to comply with card association rules, we may be fined, required to pay additional processing fees, lose our ability to accept certain credit and debit card payments from our customers, or facilitate other types of online payments . We are also subject to periodic audits, self-assessments, and other assessments of our compliance with the rules and obligations .\n Compliance with the Standard may not prevent all security incidents . We rely on banks, card schemes, and other payment processors to execute certain components of the payments process . If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these third parties on favorable terms, fees are increased, or if we provide security, our profit margin, business, and results of operations could be harmed .\n There is uncertainty about the validity and enforceability of intellectual property rights related to our use of Gen. erty in the U.S. and other jurisdictions . Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available . We may be required to expend significant time and resources to prevent infringement .\n In the ordinary course of our business, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others . Successful infringement claims against us could result in a significant monetary liability and/or prevent us from operating our business . Failure to meet climate-related commitments may adversely impact reputation, employee retention, and willingness of customers and partners to do business with us .\n Customers' actual demand for ESG-oriented product offerings may be more expensive and less available than other options . We may need to invest significant effort and resources relating to required ESG disclosures, and inconsistent and uncertain regulations may lead us to revise or discontinue our commitments or how we measure and report ESG data . Failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our ESG objectives could expose us to government enforcement actions, private litigation, and actions by stockholders .\n In the EU, the ePrivacy Directive regulates the use of cookies and similar technologies . In the U.S., disclosure requirements and limitations may apply to certain cookies and other online tracking technologies deemed to be sales of personal information under the CCPA or other state laws . Authorities may assert that our collection, use, or management of customer and other data is inconsistent with laws and regulations .\n Our liquidity, credit ratings, and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by global financial conditions and events . Failure or perceived failure to comply with evolving privacy regulations, guidance, and interpretations could result in significant fines, government enforcement actions, private litigation, and harm to our business, results of operations, or reputation .\n We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . Our foreign-currency-denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income are lower as expressed in U.S. dollars . We may need to seek other sources of funding if we do not receive commercially reasonable terms in the future .\n The market for technology stocks or the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which has caused, and may cause, a decrease in the market price of our common stock due to a number of factors, many of which are out of our control . To the extent that the public's perception of the prospects of tech tech companies has been changed .\n We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future . If our stock price declines or is volatile, it could increase the chances that we become the target of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources . The company's ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance .\n The value of our investments could decline, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations . Our ability to make share repurchases and the payment of dividends rely on our access to capital . Our investments in private entities are inherently risky in that such companies are typically at an early stage of development, may have no or limited revenues, may not be or ever become profitable .\n The Company could lose the full amount of any of its investments, and impairment of our investments have previously and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations . The Company's management-level risk committee is tasked with ensuring risks, including those related to cybersecurity, are managed and aligning strategic objectives with an appropriate level of risk tolerance .\n Security teams have established procedures for identifying, assessing, and managing, cybersecurity incidents . The results of these assessments are discussed with the Board and the Cybersecurity Subcommittee of the Audit Committee . We require that all employees complete regular data security and privacy trainings, and conduct phishing tests and specialized training such as secure coding training for our developers .\n We have experienced cybersecurity incidents and threats, including malware, phishing, account takeover attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and inadvertent disclosures of data . We do not believe these cybersecurity incidents have had a material adverse effect on our Company . However, the cybersecurity threat environment is increasingly challenging, and we, along with the entire digital ecosystem, face a constant and increasing threat ."
