Ameren also has other subsidiaries that conduct other activities, such as providing shared services .\n The rates that Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are allowed to charge for their utility services significantly influence the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of these companies and Ameren . The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated . The utility rates charged to customers are determined by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC .\n The extent of the regulatory lag varies for each of Ameren’s electric and natural gas jurisdictions . The effects of regulatory lag are mitigated by various means, including annual revenue requirement reconciliations, the decoupling of revenues from sales volumes to ensure revenues approved in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes .\n Ameren Missouri’s electric generation, transmission, and delivery service rates are bundled together and charged to retail customers under a combined electric service rate . Rate changes consistent with the December 2024 order became effective in late December 2024 . Ameren Illinois will reconcile its actual revenue requirement, as adjusted for certain cost variations, to ICC-approved electric distribution rates .\n The 10.48% return includes a 50-basis-point incentive adder for participation in an RTO .

Ameren sells all of its capacity to the MISO and purchases the capacity it needs to supply its native load sales .\n In 2022, the FERC issued an order approving changes to the annual MISO capacity auction . Historically, the auctions were designed to cover annual peak demand plus a target reserve margin . The seasonal auction structure was established to help to address variability in resources as the MISO begins to rely more heavily on renewable generation .

The addition of renewable, natural gas-fired, or nuclear generation facilities is subject to obtaining necessary project approvals .

Changes in U.S. energy policy and priorities under the current federal administration could lead to retirement of current baseload assets before the end of their current useful lives or alterations in the way those assets operate, which could result in increased capital expenditures and increased operations and maintenance expenses .\n In 2024, 2023, and 2022, Ameren Illinois procured power on behalf of its customers for 25%, 28%, and 28%, respectively, of its total kilowatthour sales .
