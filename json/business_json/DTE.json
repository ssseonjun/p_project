    "item1": "Item 1A.\n Risk Factors\nThere are various risks associated with the operations of the Registrants' utility businesses and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Registrants, below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses.  Although the Registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect performance.\nRegulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks\nThe Registrants are subject to rate regulation.  \nElectric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  The Registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC, or other regulatory bodies.  The Registrants' ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurring of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations.  Regulators may also disagree with the Registrants' rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business.  If the Registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact the Registrants' ability to recover certain costs through customer rates.  Regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for the Registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers.  The Registrants cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases, and unfavorable rate relief could impact our plans for significant capital investment.  New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses.\nChanges to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance.  \nThe State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan, have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.\nEnvironmental laws and liability may be costly.  \nThe Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.\nUncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and for DTE Energy's gas distribution businesses.  These laws and regulations require the Registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals.  The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations.  Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.\n18\nTable of \nContents\nThe Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed in Michigan, the United States, and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, or if existing deadlines for these regulations are accelerated, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Increased environmental regulation may also result in greater energy efficiency requirements and decreased demand at both the electric and gas utilities.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.\nAny perceived or alleged failure by the Registrants to comply with environmental regulations could lead to fines or penalties imposed by regulatory bodies or could result in adverse public statements and reputational damage affecting the Registrants. \n \nAdverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims.\nThe Clean Energy Standard, Renewable Portfolio Standard and energy waste reduction may affect the Registrants' business and federal and state fuel standards may affect DTE Energy's non-utility investments.  \nThe Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of clean and renewable energy.  The Registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future.  In addition, the Registrants expect to comply with new Michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by clean energy resources and renewable energy sources.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.\nIn addition, the Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results.\nDTE Energy's non-utility renewable natural gas investments are also dependent on the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard.  Changes to these standards may affect DTE Energy's business and result in lower earnings.\nDTE Energy's ability to utilize tax credits may be limited.\n  To promote U.S. climate initiatives, the Internal Revenue Code provides tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce energy from alternative sources.  The Registrants have generated tax credits from renewable energy generation and DTE Energy has generated tax credits from renewable gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, and gas production operations.  If the Registrants' tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit or changes in tax law, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nThe Registrants' electric distribution system and DTE Energy's gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation, which could reduce revenues, increase expenses, and have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, and results of operations.  \nThe Registrants' electric distribution and DTE Energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks.  These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years.  Equipment, even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants' control, and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently.  Because the Registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of the Registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.\n19\nTable of \nContents\nConstruction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities and DTE Energy's distribution systems subject them to risk.\n  The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at the Registrants' multiple power generation and distribution facilities and at DTE Energy's gas distribution system.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns, and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects.\nOperation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.  \nOwnership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options.  Insurance maintained by the Registrants for various nuclear-related risks may not be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, the Registrants' nuclear decommissioning trust fund, to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.  A decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations.  Any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the Registrants’ liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.\nThe supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  \nThe Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations and changes in transportation costs, driven by inflation or other factors, as well as fuel supply disruptions, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas, and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants' hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants' financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.\nThe price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.  The price of environmental attributes generated by DTE Energy's renewable natural gas investments, including those related to the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, may also impact the market and financial results for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.\nThe supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results\n.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, driven by inflation or other factors, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses.\nWeather significantly affects operations.  \nAs weather patterns exhibit increased deviations from historical trends, our utilities may experience financial and operational challenges.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, high winds, floods, tornadoes, or ice storms can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  Prolonged and/or more frequent outages caused by increasingly extreme weather may result in decreased revenues and could also negatively impact DTE Energy's reputation and customer satisfaction or result in increased regulatory oversight.  Related damages to customer assets could subject DTE Energy to litigation.  DTE Gas can also experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather-related issues.\n20\nTable of \nContents\nUnplanned outages at our power plants and other generating assets may be costly.  \nUnforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.\nA work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants. \n There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 4,800 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,550 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2027.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.\nDTE Energy may not achieve the carbon emissions goals of its electric and gas utilities.  \nDTE Energy has announced the voluntary commitments of its electric and gas utilities to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, along with intermediate emissions reduction goals at various points in the intervening years.  DTE Energy must also comply with the state of Michigan's requirement to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.  Technology research and developments, innovations, and advancements are critical to DTE Energy's ability to achieve these commitments, but they may not evolve as anticipated in order to provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional energy sources.  State and municipal restrictions on the siting of renewable energy assets could also impair efforts to meet our stated targets.  Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to receive regulatory approval of our capital plans to transition to renewable energy and other new technologies.  Other factors that may impact DTE Energy's ability to achieve these emissions reduction goals include our service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with current expectations, the impacts on our business of future regulations or legislation, the price and availability of carbon offsets, adoption of alternative energy products by the public such as greater use of electric vehicles, greater standardization of emissions reporting, and our ability over time to transition our electric generating portfolio.  DTE Energy's emissions reduction goals require making assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties.  Should one or more of these underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and ability to achieve our emissions reduction goals could differ materially from expectations.  In addition, DTE Energy cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving these objectives, or the various implementation aspects on its reliability, availability or price of purchased power, or on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  DTE Energy could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, or other negative repercussions if we are unable to meet our voluntary emissions reductions goals.\nFinancial, Economic, and Market Risks\nDTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations. \n DTE Energy relies on non-utility businesses for a portion of earnings and will depend on the successful execution of new business development in its non-utilities to help achieve overall growth targets.  DTE Energy also expects to grow the non-utility businesses over the long-term by developing or acquiring projects related to renewable energy, carbon capture and sequestration, and customer energy solutions; however, such opportunities may not materialize as anticipated.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value.\nAdverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.  \nRegional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity.\n21\nTable of \nContents\nPoor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.  \nThe Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding needs under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  If interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding needs.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.\nThe Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.  \nThe Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the ability of Registrants and their subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and to refinance existing debt.  Macroeconomic events may lead to higher interest rates on debt and could increase financing costs and adversely affect the Registrants' results of operations.  Rising interest rates could also reduce investor interest in DTE Energy's common stock, negatively impacting its share price and increasing its cost of equity.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2029, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.\nEmerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\n.  Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include cost-effective renewable energy technologies, distributed generation, energy waste reduction technologies, and energy storage devices.  Such developments may impact the price of energy, may affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and could make portions of our electric system power supply and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.  Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.\nDTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.  \nEvents in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.\nRegional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.  \nThe Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.\n22\nTable of \nContents\nIf DTE Energy's goodwill becomes impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.\n  DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Goodwill is also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower industry growth rates, or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery.  If the carrying value of any goodwill is determined to be not recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.\nThe Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.  \nThe Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters, war, terrorism, cyber incidents, liability claims against the Registrants, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations.\nSafety and Security Risks\nThe Registrants' businesses have safety risks.  \nThe Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.\nThreats of cyber incidents, physical security, and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business.  \nIssues may threaten the Registrants such as cyber incidents, physical security, or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations, and could harm the Registrants' operating results.\nInformation security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, and data security breaches.  \nThe Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure.  All of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents, physical security threats, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes, as well as loss of operational control of the Registrants' electric generation and distribution assets and, DTE Energy's gas distribution assets.  The Registrants have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.\nSuppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support the Registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data.  A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system.  Also\n, because the Registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the Registrants’ businesses, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.  \nIn connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise, could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.\n23\nTable of \nContents\nGeneral and Other Risks\nFailure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants\n’\n operations.  \nThe Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise from any departing employees could negatively impact the Registrants' operations.\nDTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.  \nDTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.",

    "item1c": "Item 1C. \nCybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nDTE Energy maintains cybersecurity measures designed to protect its physical and digital infrastructure in order to provide safe and reliable delivery of energy to customers.  These measures serve to maintain compliance with regulations and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of confidential and proprietary information, DTE Energy’s computing resources, and the electrical and gas systems.\nTo protect against cybersecurity threats, DTE Energy employs a dedicated cybersecurity team led by the Chief Information Officer.  The cybersecurity team is responsible for implementing proper safeguards to mitigate the risk of cyber threats, including but not limited to firewalls, continuous monitoring, and training.\n \nDTE Energy also engages with third parties to conduct cybersecurity maturity assessments to provide an independent and objective view of our cybersecurity and assess opportunities for improvement.\n  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is the basis for these assessments to manage cyber risks, mature and monitor existing security controls, and communicate security posture coherently.  The NIST CSF provides a common language to understand, manage, and express cyber risks internally and externally.\nAnother component of DTE Energy’s cybersecurity team is the Cybersecurity Defense Center (CSDC), which has the primary responsibility for monitoring and responding to cybersecurity incidents.  The CSDC maintains an incident response plan designed to protect against, detect, evaluate, and respond to and recover from a cyber incident.  The CSDC may receive incident reports from DTE Energy employees, corporate security, or external sources.  The incident response plan is intended to be flexible so it may be adapted to an array of potential scenarios.  Depending on the incident, the CSDC may decide to engage external resources for assistance with responding to the incident.  DTE Energy regularly conducts exercises to help ensure the plan’s effectiveness and overall preparedness.\nDTE Energy engages third-party service providers to assist with managing various aspects of its business.  These service providers are subject to due diligence reviews of their information security programs prior to onboarding.  DTE Energy also contractually requires service providers with access to its information technology (IT) systems, sensitive business data, or personal information to implement and maintain appropriate security controls and restricts their ability to use such data for purposes other than to provide services to DTE Energy, except as required by law.  Third-party service providers are also contractually required to notify DTE Energy promptly of cyber incidents that may affect any systems or data.  DTE Energy collaborates with its service providers to help determine whether their information security protocols are sufficient.  If a service provider experiences a cyber incident, DTE Energy monitors their compliance with our security requirements; however, DTE Energy may not have the ability in all cases to effectively oversee the implementation of these control measures.\n24\nTable of \nContents\nThe CSDC monitors and responds to actual and potential compromises from third-party service providers.  Access from a potentially compromised third-party is restricted until DTE Energy receives confirmation the compromise has been mitigated.\nDTE Energy has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, cybersecurity risks have not materially affected the Registrants’ business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

    "item1a": "Item 1A. \"Risk Factors.\"\nGovernance\nDTE Energy has an enterprise risk management program to reduce overall risk, including risks related to cybersecurity, through comprehensive risk assessments and execution of corresponding mitigation plans.  Risks are reported and managed through various internal committees, which meet regularly and report at least annually to the Board of Directors.  These committees include:\n•\nThe Risk Management Committee (RMC) is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprised of the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, General Auditor, and other senior officers.  The RMC directs the development and maintenance of comprehensive risk management policies and procedures.  The RMC also sets, reviews, and monitors risk limits for enterprise-level risk and other exposures\n•\nThe Operational Risk and Resilience (ORR) Committee is chaired by the President and Chief Operating Officer and comprised of operational leaders in DTE Energy’s business units.  The ORR is responsible for managing operational risks including safety, reliability, and cybersecurity at DTE Energy’s generation plants, substations, and other operating sites\n•\nThe Technology Cybersecurity Committee (TCC) is a sub-committee of the ORR that focuses on information and operational technology risks related to cybersecurity, chaired by operational leaders in DTE Energy’s business units and includes the Chief Information Officer\nMembers of the Board of Directors serve roles on various committees responsible for their respective oversight and risk management.\n  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, comprised solely of independent directors, is responsible for reviewing DTE Energy’s cybersecurity risks, the results of any cybersecurity risk assessments and audits, and reports of investigations into significant events presented by DTE Energy’s IT department.  \nThe Audit Committee reports to the Board of Directors and may include any significant matters involving cybersecurity within its reporting.  All members of the Board of Directors, including the Audit Committee, have either managerial knowledge or working knowledge of technology and cybersecurity matters.\nDTE Energy’s \nChief Information Officer\n leads the cybersecurity team and has responsibility for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks.  \nThe Chief Information Officer has held this position for over 10 years and has decades of experience in IT, including oversight of information protection security (IPS).  The IPS cybersecurity team is also led by two full-time directors with over 40 combined years of industry experience, including (1) the director of cybersecurity operations responsible for the CSDC, identity and access assurance, and cloud security and (2) the IPS director of cybersecurity strategy, risk, and engagement who is also responsible for engagement and outreach to internal and external stakeholders.\nThe Chief Information Officer provides regular updates to the Audit Committee and senior leaders regarding DTE Energy’s management of cyber risks, including but not limited to the status of various training metrics to safeguard against phishing, malware, and other cyber threats.  \nThe Chief Information Officer also provides an annual cybersecurity update directly to the Board of Directors.\n  If cybersecurity risks arise, the CSDC executes the incident response plan and communicates the appropriate details to executive management, the Board of Directors, or any related committees.\nA cybersecurity incident may also require various levels of external reporting.  The CSDC coordinates with the legal department and controller’s organization in reporting incidents externally.  Depending on the nature of the incident, reporting may be required to various federal and state government agencies.  DTE Energy has forged trusted partnerships with such agencies and with other companies and organizations to share best practices, tools, and threat information.

However, DTE Electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to DTE Energy or the subsidiaries of DTE Energy other than itself.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nDTE Energy is a diversified energy company with 2024 Operating Revenues of approximately $12.5 billion and Total Assets of approximately $48.8 billion.  DTE Energy is the parent company of DTE Electric and DTE Gas, regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales, distribution, and storage services throughout Michigan.  DTE Energy also operates two energy-related non-utility segments with operations throughout the United States.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below reflect DTE Energy’s continuing operations, unless noted otherwise.  The following table summarizes DTE Energy's financial results:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company\n$\n1,404\n \n$\n1,397 \n$\n1,083 \nDiluted Earnings per Common Share\n$\n6.77\n \n$\n6.76 \n$\n5.52 \nThe increase in 2024 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company was primarily due to higher earnings in the Electric segment, partially offset by lower earnings in the Energy Trading, Gas, and DTE Vantage segments and Corporate and Other.  The increase in 2023 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company was primarily due to higher earnings in the Energy Trading, DTE Vantage, and Gas segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the Electric segment and Corporate and Other.\nSTRATEGY\nDTE Energy's strategy is to achieve long-term earnings per share growth with a strong balance sheet and attractive dividend.\nDTE Energy's utilities are investing capital to support a modern, reliable grid and cleaner, affordable energy through investments in base infrastructure and new generation.  Increasing intensity of windstorms and other weather events, coupled with increasing electric vehicle adoption and potential for data centers, will drive a continued need for substantial grid investment over the long-term.\nDTE Energy plans to reduce the carbon emissions of its electric utility operations by 65% in 2028, 85% in 2032, and 90% by 2040 from 2005 carbon emissions levels.  DTE Energy plans to end its use of coal-fired power plants in 2032 and is committed to a net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 for its electric and gas utility operations.\nAdditionally, as a result of legislation passed by the state of Michigan in the fourth quarter 2023, DTE Energy will be required to meet a 100% clean energy portfolio standard by 2040.  Clean energy sources include renewables, nuclear, and natural gas-fired plants equipped with a carbon capture and storage system that is at least 90% effective in reducing carbon emissions to the atmosphere.  The legislation also requires 50% of an electric utility's energy to be generated from renewable sources by 2030 and 60% by 2035.  DTE Energy is currently assessing the impacts of this legislation and will include updates in its next Integrated Resource Plan, currently planned for 2026, to comply with the new requirements.\nTo achieve carbon reduction goals at the electric utility, DTE Energy will continue its transition away from coal-powered energy sources and is replacing or offsetting the generation from these facilities with renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage, and energy waste reduction initiatives.  Refer to the \"Capital Investments\" section below for further discussion regarding DTE Energy's retirement of its aging coal-fired plants and transition to renewable energy and other sources.  Over the long-term, DTE Energy is also monitoring and pursuing the advancement of emerging technologies such as long-duration storage, modular nuclear reactors, hydrogen, and carbon capture and sequestration, and how these technologies may support clean, reliable generation and customer affordability.\n29\nTable of \nContents\nFor the gas utility, DTE Energy aims to cut carbon emissions across the entire value chain.  DTE Energy plans to reduce the carbon emissions from its gas utility operations by 65% by 2030 and 80% by 2040, and is committed to a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 from internal gas operations and gas suppliers.  To achieve net zero, DTE Energy is working to source gas with lower methane intensity, reduce emissions through its gas main renewal and pipeline integrity programs, and if necessary, use carbon offsets to address any remaining emissions.  DTE Energy also aims to help DTE Gas customers reduce their emissions by approximately 35% by 2040 by increasing energy efficiency, pursuing advanced technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and sequestration, and through the CleanVision Natural Gas Balance program which provides customers the option to use carbon offsets and renewable natural gas.\nDTE Energy expects that these initiatives at the electric and gas utilities will continue to provide significant opportunities for capital investments and result in earnings growth.  DTE Energy is focused on executing its plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability.  To support its goals for customer affordability, DTE Energy is working to implement operational efficiencies and optimize opportunities from the Inflation Reduction Act to generate tax credits relating to renewable energy, nuclear generation, energy storage, and carbon capture and sequestration.  These tax credits may reduce the cost of owning related assets and reduce customer rate impacts from any future cost recoveries.  DTE Energy's utilities operate in a constructive regulatory environment and have solid relationships with their regulators.\nDTE Energy also has significant investments in non-utility businesses and expects growth opportunities in its DTE Vantage segment.  DTE Energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets, skills, and expertise, and provides attractive returns and diversity in earnings and geography.  Specifically, DTE Energy invests in targeted markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile.\nA key priority for DTE Energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced financing.  Growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity.  DTE Energy has an enterprise risk management program that, among other things, is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes, interest rates, and counterparty credit risk.\nCAPITAL INVESTMENTS\nDTE Energy's utility businesses will require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and achieve goals for carbon emission reductions.  Capital plans may be regularly updated as these requirements and goals evolve and may be subject to regulatory approval.\nDTE Electric's capital investments over the 2025-2029 period are estimated at $24 billion, comprised of $10 billion for distribution infrastructure, $4 billion for base infrastructure, and $10 billion for cleaner generation including renewables.\nDTE Electric has retired all eleven coal-fired generation units at the Trenton Channel, River Rouge, and St. Clair facilities, and plans to repurpose the Trenton Channel plant to a battery energy storage system in 2026.  DTE Electric has also announced plans to retire its remaining six coal-fired generating units, including converting the two units at the Belle River facility from a base load coal plant to a natural gas peaking resource in 2025-2026.  The four units at the Monroe facility are expected to be retired in two stages in 2028 and 2032.  Generation from the retired facilities will continue to be replaced or offset with a combination of renewables, energy waste reduction, demand response, battery storage, and natural gas fueled generation.\nDTE Gas' capital investments over the 2025-2029 period are estimated at $4.0 billion, comprised of $2.5 billion for base infrastructure and $1.5 billion for the gas renewal program, which includes main and service renewals, meter move-out, and pipeline integrity projects.\nDTE Electric and DTE Gas plan to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with ratemaking treatment.\nDTE Energy's non-utility businesses' capital investments are primarily for expansion, growth, and ongoing maintenance in the DTE Vantage segment, including approximately $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion from 2025-2029 for custom energy solutions and renewable energy, while expanding into carbon capture and sequestration.\n30\nTable of \nContents\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulations, including those addressing climate change.  Additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented.  Actual costs to comply could vary substantially.  The Registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers, as authorized by the MPSC.\nIncreased costs for energy produced from traditional coal-based sources due to recent, pending, and future regulatory initiatives could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable, natural gas fueled generation, and/or nuclear sources, energy waste reduction initiatives, and the potential development of market-based trading of carbon instruments.\nRefer to the \"Environmental Matters\" section within Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" for further discussion of Environmental Matters.\nOUTLOOK\nThe next few years will be a period of rapid change for DTE Energy and for the energy industry.  DTE Energy's strong utility base, combined with its integrated non-utility operations, position it well for long-term growth.\nLooking forward, DTE Energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance:\n•\nelectric and gas customer satisfaction;\n•\nelectric distribution system reliability;\n•\nnew electric generation and storage;\n•\ngas distribution system renewal;\n•\nreducing carbon emissions at the electric and gas utilities;\n•\nrate competitiveness and affordability;\n•\nregulatory stability and investment recovery for the electric and gas utilities;\n•\nstrategic investments in growth projects at DTE Vantage;\n•\nemployee engagement, health, safety and wellbeing, and diversity, equity, and inclusion;\n•\ncost structure optimization across all business segments; and\n•\ncash, capital, and liquidity to maintain or improve financial strength.\nDTE Energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic, financial, and risk criteria.\n31\nTable of \nContents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of DTE Energy's segments.

The increase in 2024 was primarily due to one-time costs of $32 million resulting from the voluntary separation incentive program, higher RPS expense of $25 million, higher EWR expense of $17 million, higher uncollectible expense of $12 million, higher corporate support costs of $12 million, higher sales and marketing expense of $10 million, higher legal expense of $9 million, higher planning and development expense of $7 million, and higher plant generation expense of $3 million, partially offset by lower distribution operations expense of $106 million (primarily due to lower storm restoration costs).\nThe decrease in 2023 was primarily due to lower plant generation expense of $108 million (primarily due to lower outage costs and coal plant retirements), lower benefits and other compensation expense of $67 million, lower corporate support costs of $55 million, and lower legal expense of $14 million.  These decreases were partially offset by higher distribution operations expense of $99 million, which was primarily due to higher storm restoration costs.\nDepreciation and amortization\n expense increased $107 million in 2024 and $122 million in 2023.  In 2024, the increase was primarily due to a $103 million increase from a higher depreciable base.  In 2023, the increase was primarily due to a $113 million increase from a higher depreciable base and an increase of $10 million associated with the TRM.\nTaxes other than income\n increased $14 million 2024 and had no change in 2023.  The increase in 2024 was primarily due to higher property taxes.\nAsset (gains) losses and impairments, net\n decreased $15 million in 2024 and increased $19 million in 2023.  The change in both periods was primarily due to MPSC disallowances of previously recorded capital expenditures, including $12 million from the January 2025 rate order written off in 2024 and $25 million from the December 2023 rate order written off in 2023.\nOther (Income) and Deductions\n increased $32 million in 2024 and $40 million in 2023.  The increase in 2024 was primarily due to higher net interest expense of $79 million, partially offset by higher AFUDC equity of $44 million and lower non-operating retirement benefits of $7 million.  The increase in 2023 was primarily due to higher net interest expense of $48 million and higher non-operating retirement benefits expense of $26 million, partially offset by a favorable change in investment earnings of $19 million and higher AFUDC equity of $14 million.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\n changed $109 million in 2024 and increased $53 million in 2023.  The change in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in tax credits, partially offset by higher earnings.  The increase in 2023 was primarily due to lower amortization of the TCJA regulatory liability, partially offset by lower earnings.\n34\nTable of \nContents\nOutlook\n \n—\n DTE Electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustain strong cash flows, and earn its authorized return on equity.  DTE Electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth.  DTE Electric will maintain a strong focus on customers by increasing reliability and satisfaction while working to keep customer rate increases affordable.  Looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather, the outcome of regulatory proceedings, uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding environmental compliance, and effects of energy waste reduction programs.\nGAS SEGMENT\nThe Gas segment consists principally of DTE Gas.

The increase in 2024 was primarily due to higher net interest expense of $14 million.\nIncome Tax Expense\n decreased $16 million in 2024 and increased $5 million in 2023.  The decrease in 2024 was primarily due to lower earnings.  The increase in 2023 was primarily due to higher earnings.\nOutlook —\n DTE Gas will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustain strong cash flows, and earn its authorized return on equity.  DTE Gas expects that planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth.  Looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather and the outcome of regulatory proceedings.  DTE Gas expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability.\n36\nTable of \nContents\nDTE VANTAGE SEGMENT\nThe DTE Vantage segment is comprised primarily of renewable energy projects that sell electricity and pipeline-quality gas and projects that deliver custom energy solutions to industrial, commercial, and institutional customers.

The 2024 increase was primarily due to a new project in the On-site business of $7 million and higher costs in the On-site business of $11 million, Renewables business of $6 million, and Steel business of $6 million.  The 2023 decrease was primarily due to lower operating costs in the Renewables business of $13 million and lower operating costs in the On-site business of $24 million, which was primarily driven by a decrease of $11 million due to the sale of a project.\nDepreciation and amortization \nincreased $6 million in 2024 and $1 million in 2023.  The increase in 2024 was primarily due to new projects in the Renewables business.\nAsset (gains) losses and impairments, net\n changed by $20 million in 2024 from the net gain of $10 million in 2023, and changed by $3 million in 2023 from the net gain of $7 million in 2022.  The change in 2024 was primarily due to the write-off of carbon capture and sequestration assets of $10 million and net gains of $10 million from 2023 that did not repeat in the current year.\nThe change in 2023 was primarily due to a gain of $17 million resulting from a change in estimate of an asset retirement obligation in the Steel business, partially offset by asset write-offs in other business units of $7 million.  The net gain for 2023 was also partially offset by $7 million due to settlement of contingent consideration relating to a 2017 acquisition in the Renewables business, which resulted in a loss of $2 million in 2023 compared to a gain of $5 million recorded in 2022.\nOther (Income) and Deductions\n increased $37 million in 2024 and $12 million in 2023.  The 2024 increase was primarily due to higher interest income of $41 million associated with a new project in the On-site business and a gain in the Renewable business of $25 million attributed to the sale of a partnership interest, partially offset by a write-off of an equity investment in the Renewables business due to impairment of $23 million and higher net interest expense of $9 million.  The 2023 increase was primarily due to $7 million higher equity investment earnings in the Renewables business and $4 million higher interest income associated with a new project in the Steel business.\nIncome Taxes — Expense\n decreased $4 million in 2024 and increased $11 million in 2023.  The decrease in 2024 was primarily due to a $6 million impact from lower pre-tax income, partially offset by a $2 million higher deferred tax expense related to the reduction in tax basis on property that generated ITCs.  The increase in 2023 was primarily due to a $6 million impact from higher pre-tax income.  The increase was also due to $5 million higher deferred tax expense related to the reduction in tax basis on property that generated ITCs.\nIncome Taxes — Tax Credits \nincreased $11 million in 2024 and $51 million in 2023.  The increase in 2024 was primarily due to a new project in the On-site business of $60 million, partially offset by 2023 tax credits of $48 million from new projects in the prior year that did not repeat.  The increase in 2023 was primarily due to ITCs of $39 million related to new projects in the Renewables business and $9 million for a new project in the On-site business.\n38\nTable of \nContents\nOutlook —\n In December 2024, DTE Vantage entered into a series of agreements with a large industrial customer to design, construct, own, and operate certain energy infrastructure assets at the customer's planned battery manufacturing plant in Michigan.  The project is expected to begin construction in 2025 and achieve commercial operations in 2026 for a term of 20 years.\nDTE Vantage will continue to leverage its extensive energy-related operating experience and project management capability to develop additional renewable natural gas projects and other projects that provide customer specific energy solutions.  DTE Vantage is also developing decarbonization opportunities relating to carbon capture and sequestration projects.\nENERGY TRADING SEGMENT\nEnergy Trading focuses on physical and financial power, natural gas and environmental marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions.  Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power, environmental, and related services, which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers' behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers.

The increase in 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to higher compensation costs.\nNatural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future and/or natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related non-derivative pipeline transportation contract.  These gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are marked-to-market without revaluing the related non-derivative contracts.\nOperating Income (Loss) decreased $268 million in 2024, which includes a $167 million unfavorable change in timing-related gains primarily related to gas strategies subject to reversal in future periods as the underlying contracts settle.  The decrease also includes a $107 million unfavorable change in timing-related gains and losses primarily related to gas strategies that were recognized in previous periods and subsequently reversed as the underlying contracts settled.\nOperating Income (Loss) increased $558 million in 2023, which includes a $429 million favorable change in timing-related gains and losses primarily related to gas strategies subject to reversal in future periods as the underlying contracts settle.  The increase also includes a $19 million favorable change in timing-related losses primarily related to gas strategies that were recognized in previous periods and subsequently reversed as the underlying contracts settled.\nOther (Income) and Deductions \nincreased $13 million in 2024 and decreased $13 million in 2023.  The increase in 2024 was primarily due to $22 million of higher contributions to not-for-profit organizations, partially offset by higher net interest income of $9 million.  The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to $10 million of lower contributions to not-for-profit organizations and lower net interest expense of $3 million.\nOutlook —\n In the near-term, Energy Trading expects market conditions to remain challenging.  The profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with regulatory changes, and changes in operating rules of RTOs.  Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged.  Most financial instruments, physical power and natural gas contracts, and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives; whereas, natural gas and environmental inventory, contracts for pipeline transportation, storage assets, and some environmental contracts are not derivatives.  As a result, Energy Trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets.  Energy Trading's strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps, and options.  This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods.\nSee also the \"Fair Value\" section herein and Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value\" and \"Financial and Other Derivative Instruments,\" respectively.\n40\nTable of \nContents\nCORPORATE AND OTHER\nCorporate and Other includes various holding company activities, holds certain non-utility debt, and holds certain investments, including investments supporting regional development and economic growth.  The 2024 net loss of $185 million represents an increase of $27 million from the 2023 net loss of $158 million.  This increase was primarily due to higher net interest expense and higher state income taxes, partially offset by lower equity investment losses.\nThe 2023 net loss of $158 million represents an increase of $13 million from the 2022 net loss of $145 million.  This increase was primarily due to higher net interest expense, partially offset by lower equity investment losses, lower valuation allowances, lower corporate overhead costs, and lower benefits expense.\nOutlook —\n Corporate and Other will continue to support DTE Energy's goals to achieve long-term earnings growth by managing corporate costs such as interest and tax expense.  Corporate and Other will also continue to support DTE Energy in achieving a strong balance sheet, access to capital markets, and implementation of a financing plan that includes interest rate management in order to manage interest costs.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nCash Requirements\nDTE Energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities, to grow the non-utility businesses, to retire and pay interest on long-term debt, and to pay dividends.  DTE Energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements.  DTE Energy expects that cash from operations in 2025 will be approximately $3.3 billion.  DTE Energy anticipates base level utility capital investments, including environmental, renewable, and energy waste reduction expenditures, and expenditures for non-utility businesses of approximately $4.9 billion in 2025.  DTE Energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment.  Capital spending for growth of existing or new non-utility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict risk-return and value creation criteria.\nRefer below for analysis of cash flows relating to operating, investing, and financing activities, which reflect DTE Energy's change in financial condition.  Any significant non-cash items are included in the Supplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash at Beginning of Period\n$\n51\n \n$\n43 \n$\n35 \nNet cash from operating activities\n3,643\n \n3,220 \n1,977 \nNet cash used for investing activities\n(4,951)\n(4,095)\n(3,431)\nNet cash from financing activities\n1,345\n \n883 \n1,462 \nNet Increase in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n37\n \n8 \n8 \nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash at End of Period\n$\n88\n \n$\n51 \n$\n43 \nCash from Operating Activities\nA majority of DTE Energy's operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities, which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather, electric retail access, regulatory deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions, changes in working capital, and operating costs.\nNet cash from operations increased $423 million in 2024.  The increase was primarily due to higher cash from working capital items and an increase in Depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in cash related to Allowance for equity funds used during construction.\nThe change in working capital items in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in cash related to Accounts payable, Derivative assets and liabilities, and Other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in cash related to Accounts receivable net, Inventories, Accrued pension liability, and Accrued postretirement liability.\n41\nTable of \nContents\nNet cash from operations increased $1.2 billion in 2023.  The increase was primarily due to higher cash from working capital items and increases in Net income, Depreciation and amortization, and Deferred income taxes.\nThe change in working capital items in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in cash related to Accounts receivable, net and Regulatory assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in cash related to Prepaid postretirement benefit costs, Accounts payable, Derivative assets and liabilities, and Other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities.\nCash used for Investing Activities\nCash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions.  In any given year, DTE Energy looks to realize cash from under-performing or non-strategic assets or matured, fully valued assets.\nCapital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy goals.\nCapital spending within the non-utility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance, expansion, and growth.  DTE Energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks, and returns.  All new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis.  DTE Energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria.  For new business lines, DTE Energy initially invests based on research and analysis.  DTE Energy starts with a limited investment, evaluates the results, and either expands or exits the business based on those results.  In any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of DTE Energy, with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings.\nNet cash used for investing activities increased $856 million in 2024 and $664 million in 2023 due primarily to increases in utility plant and equipment expenditures and cash used related to Notes receivable.\nCash from Financing Activities\nDTE Energy relies on both short-term borrowing and long-term financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations.\nDTE Energy's strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity.  DTE Energy targets balance sheet financial metrics to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating.\nNet cash from financing activities increased $462 million in 2024.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in Issuance of long-term debt, net of issuance costs, partially offset by decreases in cash related to Redemption of long-term debt and Short-term borrowings, net.\nNet cash from financing activities decreased $579 million in 2023.  The decrease was primarily due to the Issuance of common stock in 2022 and a decrease in Short-term borrowings, net, partially offset by an increase in Issuance of long-term debt, net of issuance costs.\nOutlook\nSources of Cash\nDTE Energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the long-term, primarily as a result of growth from the utility and non-utility businesses.  Growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending which will increase the base from which rates are determined.  Further, the Inflation Reduction Act allows for extended tax benefits for renewable technologies, increased rates for PTCs and an option to claim PTCs for solar projects, expanded qualified ITC facilities to include standalone energy storage, and allows for the transfer of tax credits generated from renewable projects.  DTE Electric expects to continue to monetize these tax credits to generate cash flows in the near-term.  DTE Energy expects long-term growth in sales related to vehicle electrification, but no significant impacts in the near-term.  Non-utility growth is expected from additional investments in the DTE Vantage segment, primarily related to renewable energy and custom energy solutions, while expanding into carbon capture and sequestration.  DTE Vantage also expects enhanced growth opportunities in decarbonization as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for renewable natural gas and carbon capture projects.\n42\nTable of \nContents\nDTE Energy's utilities may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of MPSC orders.  Energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future.  DTE Energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of long-term capital projects.\nAt the discretion of management and depending upon economic and financial market conditions, DTE Energy expects to issue up to $100 million of equity in 2025.  DTE Energy anticipates these discretionary equity issuances would be made through contributions to the dividend reinvestment plan and/or employee benefit plans.\nOver the long-term, some additional equity may be needed beginning in 2028 to support long-term growth.  DTE Energy will continue to evaluate equity needs on an annual basis.  DTE Energy currently expects its primary source of long-term financing to be the issuance of debt and is monitoring changes in interest rates and impacts on the cost of borrowing.\nUses of Cash\nDTE Energy has $1.3 billion in long-term debt, including securitization bonds and finance leases, maturing in the next twelve months.  Repayment of the debt is expected to be made through internally generated funds and the issuance of short-term and/or long-term debt.\nDTE Energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for more than 100 consecutive years and expects to continue paying regular cash dividends in the future, including approximately $0.9 billion in 2025.  Any payment of future dividends is subject to approval by the Board of Directors and may depend on DTE Energy's future earnings, capital requirements, and financial condition.  Over the long-term, DTE Energy expects continued dividend growth and is targeting a payout ratio consistent with pure-play utility companies.  Dividends are subject to certain restrictions as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Short-Term Credit Arrangements and Borrowings.\"  However, these restrictions are not expected to impact DTE Energy's planned dividend payments.\nVarious subsidiaries and equity investees of DTE Energy have entered into derivative and non-derivative contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by DTE Energy.  These contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that DTE Energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE Energy's credit rating is downgraded below investment grade.  Certain of these provisions (known as \"hard triggers\") state specific circumstances under which DTE Energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as \"soft triggers\") are not as specific.  For contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which DTE Energy may ultimately be required to post.  The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily natural gas, power, and environmental) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions.  As of December 31, 2024, DTE Energy's contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was $360 million.\nFor cash obligations related to leases and future purchase commitments, refer to Note 16 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Leases.\" and \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" respectively.  Purchase commitments include capital expenditures that are contractually obligated.  Also refer to the \"Capital Investments\" section above for additional information on DTE Energy's capital strategy and estimated spend over the next five years.\nOther obligations are further described in the following Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:\nNote\nTitle\n1\nOrganization and Basis of Presentation\n7\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n8\nRegulatory Matters\n9\nIncome Taxes\n12\nFinancial and Other Derivative Instruments\n13\nLong-Term Debt\n15\nShort-Term Credit Arrangements and Borrowings\n17\nCommitments and Contingencies\n19\nRetirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets\n20\nStock-Based Compensation\n43\nTable of \nContents\nLiquidity\nDTE Energy has approximately $1.9 billion of available liquidity at December 31, 2024, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements.\nDTE Energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility, cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs.  However, virtually all DTE Energy's businesses are capital intensive, or require access to capital, and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities.  DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing, as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets.  DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets.  However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors.\nAs part of the normal course of business, DTE Electric, DTE Gas, and various non-utility subsidiaries of DTE Energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal, capacity, storage, and other energy-related products and services.  Certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that DTE Energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade.  The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial.  Also, upon a downgrade below investment grade, DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market, and if DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade, the non-utility businesses could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity.  A downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets.  The impact of a downgrade will not affect DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' ability to comply with existing debt covenants.  While DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade, they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Registrants' management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.  Additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nRegulation\nA significant portion of the Registrants' businesses are subject to regulation.  This results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses.  DTE Electric and DTE Gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses.  Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants' management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\"\n44\nTable of \nContents\nDerivatives\nDerivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative assets or liabilities.  Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change.  The normal purchases and normal sales exception requires, among other things, physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business.  Contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value.  Substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by DTE Electric and DTE Gas meet the criteria specified for this exception.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market.  Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities.  These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable inputs.  The Registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques.  Credit risk of the Registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact of which was immaterial at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  The Registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe fair values the Registrants calculate for their derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information.  Actual cash returns realized on derivatives may be different from the results the Registrants estimate using models.  As fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices, the Registrants perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of forward contracts.  See the sensitivity analysis in Item 7A. of this report, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"  See also the \"Fair Value\" section herein.\nSee Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value\" and \"Financial and Other Derivative Instruments,\" respectively.\nGoodwill\nDTE Energy's reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from business combinations.  DTE Energy performs an impairment test for each of the reporting units annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired.\nIn performing the impairment test, DTE Energy compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill.  If the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit, an impairment loss would be recognized.  A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nDTE Energy estimates the reporting unit's fair value using standard valuation techniques, including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit.  For all reporting units except Energy Trading, the fair values were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries.  For the Energy Trading reporting unit, only the income approach was used due to the lack of comparable market information.\nDiscounted cash flows used in the income approach are based on DTE Energy's internal business plan for the next five years plus a terminal value.  DTE Energy capitalizes the terminal value for each reporting unit using a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) less an assumed long-term growth rate.  The income approach cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance. \nOne of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies.  Management selects comparable peers based on each peer’s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of the test date. \n45\nTable of \nContents\nDTE Energy performs an annual impairment test each October.  In between annual tests, DTE Energy monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows, including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters, and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs.  While DTE Energy believes the assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ from projections.  To the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill, which would adversely impact DTE Energy's earnings.\nDTE Energy performed its annual impairment test as of October 1, 2024.  In estimating fair value for the income approach, DTE Energy used discounted rates ranging from 6.5% to 9.0%.  Based on the weighting of the estimated fair value using an income and market approach, DTE Energy determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment existed.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Registrants evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable.  Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the long-lived assets are deteriorating business climate, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life.  The review of long-lived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions.  An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of long-lived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities.  Impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows.  When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the long-lived asset over its fair value.  An impairment would require the Registrants to reduce both the long-lived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment, which would adversely impact their earnings.\nPension and Other Postretirement Costs\nDTE Energy sponsors both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the Registrants.  The measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors, including numerous assumptions and accounting elections.  When determining the various assumptions that are required, DTE Energy considers historical information as well as future expectations.  The benefit costs are affected by, among other things, the actual rate of return on plan assets, the long-term expected return on plan assets, the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, benefit plan design changes, and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees.  Pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments, some of which are capitalized.\nDTE Energy had pension credits of $18 million and $69 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and pension costs of $123 million in 2022.  Other postretirement benefit credits were $44 million in 2024, $38 million in 2023, and $66 million in 2022.  Pension and other postretirement benefit credits for 2024 were calculated based upon several actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00% for the pension plans and 7.60% for the other postretirement benefit plans.  In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumptions, DTE Energy evaluated asset class risk and return expectations, as well as inflation assumptions.  Projected returns are based on broad equity, bond, and other markets.  DTE Energy's 2025 expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of 15% in equity markets, 58% in fixed income markets - including long duration bonds, and 27% invested in other assets.  DTE Energy's 2025 expected long-term rate of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of 7% in equity markets, 63% in fixed income markets - including long duration bonds, and 30% invested in other assets.  Because of market volatility, DTE Energy periodically reviews the asset allocation and rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate.  DTE Energy is decreasing its long-term rate of return assumption for the pension plans to 7.80% and decreasing the other postretirement plans to 7.50% for 2025.  DTE Energy believes these rates are reasonable assumptions for the long-term rates of return on the plans' assets for 2025 given their respective asset allocations and DTE Energy's capital market expectations.  DTE Energy will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually.\n46\nTable of \nContents\nDTE Energy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year.  Current accounting rules provide that the MRV of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years.  For the pension plans, DTE Energy uses a calculated value when determining the MRV of the pension plan assets and recognizes changes in fair value over a three-year period.  Accordingly, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized.  As of December 31, 2024, DTE Energy had $131 million of cumulative losses related to investment performance in prior years that were not yet recognized in the calculation of the MRV of pension assets.  For other postretirement benefit plans, DTE Energy uses fair value when determining the MRV of plan assets; therefore, all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of MRV for these plans.\nThe discount rate that DTE Energy utilizes for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency.  The yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to the plans.  The discount rate determined on this basis was 5.65% for the pension plans and 5.66% for the other postretirement plans at December 31, 2024 compared to 5.00% for both the pension and other postretirement plans at December 31, 2023.\nDTE Energy changed the mortality assumptions as of December 31,2024 to reflect recent plan experience.  The mortality assumptions used at December 31, 2024 are the PRI-2012 mortality table projected using Scale MP-2021,  with generational projection.  The base mortality tables vary by type of plan, employee's union status and employment status, with additional adjustments to reflect the actual experience and credibility of each population.\nDTE Energy estimates a total pension cost of approximately $60 million for 2025, compared to the credit of $18 million in 2024.  The expected change is primarily related to the recognition of deferred investment losses.  The 2025 other postretirement benefit credit is estimated at approximately $40 million, comparable to the credit of $44 million in 2024.\nThe health care trend rates for DTE Energy assume 8.50% for pre-65 participants and 9.00% for post-65 participants for 2025, trending down to 4.50% for both pre-65 and post-65 participants in 2035.\nFuture actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates, and various other factors related to plan design.\nLowering the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the 2024 pension credit by approximately $43 million.  Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased the 2024 pension credit by approximately $18 million.  Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the 2024 other postretirement credit by approximately $16 million.  Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased the 2024 other postretirement credit by approximately $7 million.\nThe value of the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was $5.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2023.  At December 31, 2024, DTE Energy's qualified pension plans were underfunded by $115 million and its other postretirement benefit plans were over-funded by $471 million.  In 2024, the funded status of the pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans improved primarily due to higher discount rates, along with updated demographic assumptions that lowered the liability for the other postretirement benefit plans. \nPension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets.  Any required pension funding will be made by contributing amounts consistent with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.  DTE Energy made a nominal contribution to its qualified pension plans in 2024, no contribution in 2023, and does not anticipate making any material contributions in 2025.  At the discretion of management and depending on financial market conditions, DTE Gas anticipates transferring up to $25 million of qualified pension plan funds to DTE Electric annually for the next five years in exchange for cash consideration.  DTE Energy did not make other postretirement benefit plan contributions in 2024 or 2023 and does not anticipate making any contributions to the other postretirement plans in 2025 or over the next five years.  All planned contributions will be at the discretion of management and subject to any changes in financial market conditions.  \nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Retirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets.\"\n47\nTable of \nContents\nLegal Reserves\nThe Registrants are involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  The Registrants regularly assess their liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate.  Legal reserves are based upon the Registrants' management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the Registrants.\nAccounting for Tax Obligations\nThe Registrants are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities.  The Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion, and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  If the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded.  Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold.  The Registrants also have non-income tax obligations related to property, sales and use, and employment-related taxes, and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters.\nAccounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained, and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken.  The Registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carry-forwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Registrants believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are appropriate.  The ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements, and such adjustments could be material.\nSee Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Income Taxes.\"\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"New Accounting Pronouncements.\"\nFAIR VALUE\nDerivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative assets or liabilities.  Contracts DTE Energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power, natural gas, some environmental contracts, and certain forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts.  Items DTE Energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas and environmental inventory, pipeline transportation contracts, storage assets, and some environmental contracts.  See Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value\" and \"Financial and Other Derivative Instruments,\" respectively.\nThe tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of non-derivative natural gas storage, transportation, certain power contracts, and some environmental contracts which are subject to accrual accounting.  Consequently, gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods, resulting in volatility in the Registrants' reported period-by-period earnings; however, the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery and/or settlement.\nThe Registrants manage their MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract.  Accordingly, the Registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or natural gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year).\nThe Registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  For further discussion of the fair value hierarchy, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value.\"\n48\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table provides details on changes in DTE Energy's MTM net asset (or liability) position:\nTotal\n(In millions)\nMTM at December 31, 2023\n$\n97 \nReclassified to realized upon settlement\n(342)\nChanges in fair value recorded to income\n347 \nAmounts recorded to unrealized income\n5 \nChanges in fair value recorded in Regulatory liabilities\n21 \nAmounts recorded in other comprehensive income, pretax\n38 \nChange in collateral\n(89)\nMTM at December 31, 2024\n$\n72\n \nThe table below shows the maturity of DTE Energy's MTM positions.

However, the Registrants do not bear significant exposure to earnings risk, as such changes are included in the PSCR and GCR regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms.  Earnings may be indirectly impacted if PSCR or GCR charges increase such that it impacts the collectability of receivables and increases uncollectible expense.  Refer to the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts section below for additional information.\nChanges in the price of natural gas can also impact the valuation of lost and unaccounted for gas, storage sales, and transportation services revenue at the Gas segment.  The Gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of long-term storage contracts.  The Registrants are exposed to short-term cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery.\nThe DTE Vantage segment is subject to price risk for electricity, natural gas, coal products, and environmental attributes generated from its renewable natural gas investments.  DTE Energy manages its exposure to commodity price risk through the use of long-term contracts and hedging instruments, when available.\nDTE Energy's Energy Trading business segment has exposure to electricity, natural gas, environmental, crude oil, heating oil, and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations.  These risks are managed by the energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy, capacity, storage, options, and futures contracts, within predetermined risk parameters.\n49\nTable of \nContents\nCredit Risk\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Registrants regularly review contingent matters, existing and future economic conditions, customer trends and other factors relating to customers and their contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts.  The Registrants believe their accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss.  The Registrants manage this risk by working at the state and federal levels to promote funding programs for low-income customers, providing energy assistance programs and support, and promoting timely customer payments through adherence to MPSC billing practice rules relating to payment arrangements, energy disconnects, and restores.\nTrading Activities\nDTE Energy is exposed to credit risk through trading activities.  Credit risk is the potential loss that may result if the trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations.  DTE Energy utilizes both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of trading counterparties.\nThe following table displays the credit quality of DTE Energy's trading counterparties as of December 31, 2024:\nCredit Exposure\nBefore Cash\nCollateral\nCash\nCollateral\nNet Credit\nExposure\n(In millions)\nInvestment Grade\n(a)\nA- and Greater\n$\n403 \n$\n— \n$\n403 \nBBB+ and BBB\n371 \n— \n371 \nBBB-\n12 \n— \n12 \nTotal Investment Grade\n786 \n— \n786 \nNon-investment grade\n(b)\n12 \n— \n12 \nInternally Rated — investment grade\n(c)\n331 \n— \n331 \nInternally Rated — non-investment grade\n(d)\n10 \n(1)\n9 \nTotal\n$\n1,139\n \n$\n(1)\n$\n1,138\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nThis category includes counterparties with minimum credit ratings of Baa3 assigned by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) or BBB- assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Group, a division of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Standard & Poor’s).  The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented 23% of the total gross credit exposure.\n(b)\nThis category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment grade.  The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented 1% of the total gross credit exposure.\n(c)\nThis category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s but are considered investment grade based on DTE Energy’s evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness.  The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented 11% of the total gross credit exposure.\n(d)\nThis category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s and are considered non-investment grade based on DTE Energy’s evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness.  The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented less than 1% of the total gross credit exposure.\nOther\nThe Registrants engage in business with customers that are non-investment grade.  The Registrants closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and, when deemed necessary and permitted under the tariffs, request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nDTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt.  In order to manage interest costs, DTE Energy may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements.  DTE Energy's exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial paper rates, credit spreads, and SOFR.  As of December 31, 2024, DTE Energy had floating rate debt of $1.1 billion and a floating rate debt-to-total debt ratio of 4.8%.\n50\nTable of \nContents\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nDTE Energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts.  These contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power, as well as for long-term transportation capacity.  To limit DTE Energy's exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations, DTE Energy has entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through December 2032.\nSummary of Sensitivity Analyses\nSensitivity analyses were performed on the fair values of commodity contracts for DTE Energy and long-term debt obligations for the Registrants.  The commodity contracts listed below principally relate to energy marketing and trading activities.  The sensitivity analyses involved increasing and decreasing forward prices and rates at December 31, 2024 and 2023 by a hypothetical 10% and calculating the resulting change in the fair values.  The hypothetical losses related to long-term debt would be realized only if DTE Energy transferred all of its fixed-rate long-term debt to other creditors.\nThe results of the sensitivity analyses:\nAssuming a\n10% Increase in Prices/Rates\nAssuming a\n10% Decrease in Prices/Rates\nAs of December 31,\nAs of December 31,\nActivity\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nChange in the Fair Value of\n(In millions)\nGas contracts\n$\n26\n \n$\n40 \n$\n(26)\n$\n(40)\nCommodity contracts\nPower contracts\n$\n1\n \n$\n1 \n$\n(1)\n$\n(1)\nCommodity contracts\nEnvironmental contracts\n$\n(8)\n$\n(7)\n$\n8\n \n$\n7 \nCommodity contracts\nOil contracts\n$\n—\n \n$\n1 \n$\n—\n \n$\n(1)\nCommodity contracts\nInterest rate risk — DTE Energy\n$\n(789)\n$\n(733)\n$\n848\n \n$\n786 \nLong-term debt\nInterest rate risk — DTE Electric\n$\n(494)\n$\n(492)\n$\n538\n \n$\n535 \nLong-term debt\nFor further discussion of market risk, see Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this Report and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Financial and Other Derivative Instruments.\"\n51\nTable of \nContents\nItem 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe following Consolidated Financial Statements are included herein:\nPage\nDTE Energy — Controls and Procedures\n53\nDTE Energy — Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n (PCAOB ID \n238\n)\n54\nDTE Energy — Consolidated Statements of Operations\n56\nDTE Energy — Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n57\nDTE Energy — Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\n58\nDTE Energy — Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n60\nDTE Energy — Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\n62\nDTE Electric — Controls and Procedures\n63\nDTE Electric — Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n (PCAOB ID \n238\n)\n64\nDTE Electric — Consolidated Statements of Operations\n66\nDTE Electric — Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n67\nDTE Electric — Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\n68\nDTE Electric — Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n70\nDTE Electric — Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholder's Equity\n71\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n72\nNote 1 — Organization and Basis of Presentation\n72\nNote 2 — Significant Accounting Policies\n75\nNote 3 — New Accounting Pronouncements\n82\nNote 4 — Revenue\n83\nNote 5 — Property, Plant, and Equipment\n87\nNote 6 — Jointly-Owned Utility Plant\n89\nNote 7 — Asset Retirement Obligations\n90\nNote 8 — Regulatory Matters\n91\nNote 9 — Income Taxes\n95\nNote 10 — Earnings Per Share\n99\nNote 11 — Fair Value\n100\nNote 12 — Financial and Other Derivative Instruments\n107\nNote 13 — Long-Term Debt\n112\nNote 14 — Preferred and Preference Securities\n114\nNote 15 — Short-Term Credit Arrangements and Borrowings\n114\nNote 16 — Leases\n115\nNote 17 — Commitments and Contingencies\n119\nNote 18 — Nuclear Operations\n124\nNote 19 — Retirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets\n125\nNote 20 — Stock-Based Compensation\n135\nNote 21 — Segment and Related Information\n137\nNote 22 — Related Party Transactions\n140\n52\nTable of \nContents\nDTE Energy — Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nManagement of DTE Energy carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of DTE Energy's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of DTE Energy's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2024, which is the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on this evaluation, DTE Energy's CEO and CFO have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by DTE Energy in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to DTE Energy's management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and procedures, management cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of its disclosure controls and procedures will be attained.\n(b) Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nManagement of DTE Energy is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, DTE Energy's CEO and CFO, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement of DTE Energy has assessed the effectiveness of DTE Energy’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO) in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n.  Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, DTE Energy’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of DTE Energy's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who also audited DTE Energy's financial statements, as stated in their report which appears herein.\n(c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting\nThere have been no changes in DTE Energy's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, DTE Energy's internal control over financial reporting.\n53\nTable of \nContents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of DTE Energy Company and its subsidiaries\n \n(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,\n \nand the related consolidated statements\n \nof operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024,\n \nincluding the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).\n \nWe also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, \nand the results of its\n \noperations and its\n \ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024\n \nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated\n \nfinancial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n54\nTable of \nContents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter\n \narising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of New, or Changes to Existing, Regulatory Matters\nAs described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded $7,511 million of regulatory assets and $3,037 million of regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2024. The Company is required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses.  Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulatory services and be charged to and collected from customers.  Future regulatory changes could result in a discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Company’s regulated businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current regulatory environment.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of new, or changes to existing, regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in assessing the potential outcomes and related accounting impacts associated with new, or changes to existing, regulatory matters and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the appropriateness of management’s assessment and audit evidence related to the assessment.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s assessment and implementation of new regulatory matters or changes to existing regulatory matters. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment of impacts arising from correspondence with regulators and changes in laws and regulations; (ii) evaluating the sufficiency of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements; and (iii) testing, on a sample basis, the regulatory assets and liabilities, including those subject to pending rate orders and regulatory proceedings, by considering (a) the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders; (b) other regulatory correspondence; and (c) application of relevant regulatory precedents.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nDetroit, Michigan\nFebruary 13, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\n55\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company\nConsolidated

Based on this evaluation, DTE Electric's CEO and CFO have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by DTE Electric in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to DTE Electric's management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and procedures, management cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of its disclosure controls and procedures will be attained.\n(b) Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nManagement of DTE Electric is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, DTE Electric's CEO and CFO, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement of DTE Electric has assessed the effectiveness of DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO) in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework.\n  Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nThis annual report does not include an audit report of DTE Electric's independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.  Management’s report was not subject to audit by DTE Electric's independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit DTE Electric to provide only management’s report in this annual report.\n(c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting\nThere have been no changes in DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting.\n63\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholder of DTE Electric Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of DTE Electric Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,\n \nand the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholder’s equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024,\n \nincluding the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of\n \nits\n \noperations and its\n \ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated\n \nfinancial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of New, or Changes to Existing, Regulatory Matters\nAs described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded $6,916 million of regulatory assets and $1,909 million of regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2024. The Company is required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses.  Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulatory services and be charged to and collected from customers.  Future regulatory changes could result in a discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Company’s regulated businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current regulatory environment.\n64\nTable of Contents\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of new, or changes to existing, regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in assessing the potential outcomes and related accounting impacts associated with new, or changes to existing, regulatory matters and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the appropriateness of management’s assessment and audit evidence related to the assessment.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s assessment and implementation of new regulatory matters or changes to existing regulatory matters. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment of impacts arising from correspondence with regulators and changes in laws and regulations; (ii) evaluating the sufficiency of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements; and (iii) testing, on a sample basis, the regulatory assets and liabilities, including those subject to pending rate orders and regulatory proceedings, by considering (a) the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders; (b) other regulatory correspondence; and (c) application of relevant regulatory precedents.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nDetroit, Michigan\nFebruary 13, 2025\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\n65\nTable of Contents\nDTE Electric Company\nConsolidated

Certain activities of DTE Electric and DTE Gas, as well as various other aspects of businesses under DTE Energy, are regulated by the FERC.  In addition, the Registrants are regulated by other federal and state regulatory agencies including the NRC, the EPA, EGLE, and for DTE Energy, the CFTC and CARB.\n72\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the Registrants are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These accounting principles require management to use estimates and assumptions that impact reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results may differ from the Registrants' estimates.\nThe information in these combined notes relates to each of the Registrants as noted in the Index of Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  However, DTE Electric does not make any representation as to information related solely to DTE Energy or the subsidiaries of DTE Energy other than itself.\nCertain prior year balances for the Registrants were reclassified to match the current year's Consolidated Financial Statements presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Registrants consolidate all majority-owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in which they have controlling influence.  Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method when the Registrants are able to significantly influence the operating policies of the investee.  When the Registrants do not influence the operating policies of an investee, the equity investment is valued at cost minus any impairments, if applicable.  These Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the Registrants' proportionate interests in certain jointly-owned utility plants.  The Registrants eliminate all intercompany balances and transactions.\nThe Registrants evaluate whether an entity is a VIE whenever reconsideration events occur.  The Registrants consolidate VIEs for which they are the primary beneficiary.  If a Registrant is not the primary beneficiary and an ownership interest is held, the VIE is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  When assessing the determination of the primary beneficiary, a Registrant considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including: the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb the expected losses and/or the right to receive the expected returns of the VIE.  The Registrants perform ongoing reassessments of all VIEs to determine if the primary beneficiary status has changed.\nLegal entities within the DTE Vantage segment enter into long-term contractual arrangements with customers to supply energy-related products or services.  The entities are generally designed to pass-through the commodity risk associated with these contracts to the customers, with DTE Energy retaining operational and customer default risk.  These entities generally are VIEs and consolidated when DTE Energy is the primary beneficiary.  In addition, DTE Energy has interests in certain VIEs through which control of all significant activities is shared with partners, and therefore are generally accounted for under the equity method.\nThe Registrants hold ownership interests in certain limited partnerships.  The limited partnerships include investment funds which support regional development and economic growth, and an operational business providing energy-related products.  These entities are generally VIEs as a result of certain characteristics of the limited partnership voting rights.  The ownership interests are accounted for under the equity method as the Registrants are not the primary beneficiaries.\nDTE Energy has variable interests in VIEs through certain of its long-term purchase and sale contracts.  DTE Electric has variable interests in VIEs through certain of its long-term purchase contracts.  As of December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that relate to its variable interests under long-term purchase and sale contracts are predominantly related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts owed by or to DTE Energy for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycle under the contracts.  As of December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that relate to its variable interests under long-term purchase contracts are predominantly related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts owed by DTE Electric for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycle under the contracts.  The Registrants have not provided any significant form of financial support associated with these long-term contracts.  There is \nno\n material potential exposure to loss as a result of DTE Energy's variable interests through these long-term purchase and sale contracts.  In addition, there is \nno\n material potential exposure to loss as a result of DTE Electric's variable interests through these long-term purchase contracts.\n73\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nDTE Electric previously financed regulatory assets for deferred costs related to certain retired generation plants and its tree trimming surge program through the sale of bonds by wholly-owned special purpose entities, DTE Securitization I and DTE Securitization II (collectively \"the DTE Securitization entities\").  The DTE Securitization entities are VIEs.  DTE Electric has the power to direct the most significant activities of these entities, including performing servicing activities such as billing and collecting surcharge revenue.  Accordingly, DTE Electric is the primary beneficiary and the DTE Securitization entities are consolidated by the Registrants.  Securitization bond holders have no recourse to the Registrants' assets, except for those held by the DTE Securitization entities.  Surcharges collected by DTE Electric to pay for bond servicing and other qualified costs reflect securitization property solely owned by the DTE Securitization entities.  These surcharges are remitted to a trustee and are not available to other creditors of the Registrants.\nThe maximum risk exposure for consolidated VIEs is reflected on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  For non-consolidated VIEs, the maximum risk exposure of the Registrants is generally limited to their investment and notes receivable.\nThe table below summarizes the major Consolidated Statements of Financial Position items for consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  All assets and liabilities of a consolidated VIE are presented where it has been determined that a consolidated VIE has either (1) assets that can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE or (2) liabilities for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.

MISO requires that DTE Electric submit hourly day-ahead, real-time, and FTR bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region.  DTE Electric accounts for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the day-ahead, real-time, and FTR markets.  In any single hour, transactions in each of the MISO energy markets are netted based on MWh to determine if DTE Electric is in a net sale or purchase position.  Net purchases are recorded in Fuel, purchased power, and gas \n—\n utility and net sales are recorded in Operating Revenues \n—\n Utility operations on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Energy Trading segment participates in the energy markets through various ISOs and RTOs.  These markets require that Energy Trading submits hourly day-ahead, real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across each region.  Energy Trading submits bids in the annual and monthly auction revenue rights and FTR auctions to the RTOs.  Energy Trading accounts for these transactions on a net hourly basis for the day-ahead, real-time, and FTR markets.  These transactions are related to trading contracts which, if derivatives, are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues \n—\n Non-utility operations, and if non-derivatives, the realized gains and losses for sales are recorded in Operating Revenues \n—\n Non-utility operations and purchases are recorded in Fuel, purchased power, gas, and other \n—\n non-utility in the DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDTE Electric and Energy Trading record accruals for future net purchase adjustments based on historical experience and reconcile accruals to actual costs when invoices are received from MISO and other ISOs and RTOs.\nDerivatives\nEnergy Trading classifies derivative transactions as revenue or expense based on the intent of the transaction (buy or sell).  Revenues are recorded on a gross or net basis within the income statement depending upon whether it represents a non-trading activity or trading activity, respectively.  Cash flows associated with derivative instruments, including related gains and losses, are presented as Operating Activities within the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  \nFor additional information, refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Financial and Other Derivative Instruments.\"\nChanges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is the change in common shareholders’ equity during a period from transactions and events from non-owner sources, including Net Income.  The amounts recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for DTE Energy include changes in benefit obligations, consisting of deferred actuarial losses and prior service costs, unrealized gains and losses from derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, and foreign currency translation adjustments, if any.  DTE Energy releases income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income when the circumstances upon which they are premised cease to exist.\nChanges in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholder's Equity, if any.\n  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, reclassifications out of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were not material.\n76\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the changes in DTE Energy's Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component\n(a)\n for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nNet Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Derivatives\nBenefit Obligations\n(b)\nForeign Currency Translation\nTotal\n(In millions)\nBalance, December 31, 2022\n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n(\n58\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n62\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n(\n14\n)\n3\n \n2\n \n(\n9\n)\nAmounts reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n1\n \n3\n \n—\n \n4\n \nNet current period Other comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n13\n)\n6\n \n2\n \n(\n5\n)\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n(\n52\n)\n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n67\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n47\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n7\n)\n37\n \nAmounts reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \nNet current period Other comprehensive income (loss)\n47\n \n1\n \n(\n7\n)\n41\n \nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n30\n \n$\n(\n51\n)\n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n(\n26\n)\n______________________________________\n(a)\nAll amounts are net of tax, except for foreign currency translation.\n(b)\nBenefit obligations activity includes changes in actuarial (gain) loss and prior service cost in DTE Energy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Retirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets,\" for details regarding this activity.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks, and temporary investments purchased with maturities of three months or less.  Restricted cash includes funds held in separate bank accounts and principally consists of amounts at DTE Securitization I and DTE Securitization II to pay for debt service and other qualified costs.  Restricted cash also consists of funds held to satisfy contractual obligations related to a large construction project at DTE Vantage.  Restricted cash designated for payments within one year is classified as a Current Asset.\nFinancing Receivables\nFinancing receivables are primarily composed of trade receivables, notes receivable, and unbilled revenue.  The Registrants' financing receivables are stated at net realizable value.\nDTE Energy had unbilled revenues of $\n992\n million and $\n882\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, including $\n303\n million and $\n311\n million of DTE Electric unbilled revenues, respectively, included in Customer Accounts receivable.\nThe Registrants monitor the credit quality of their financing receivables on a regular basis by reviewing credit quality indicators and monitoring for trigger events, such as a credit rating downgrade or bankruptcy.  Credit quality indicators include, but are not limited to, ratings by credit agencies where available, collection history, collateral, counterparty financial statements and other internal metrics.  Utilizing such data, the Registrants have determined three internal grades of credit quality.  Internal grade 1 includes financing receivables for counterparties where credit rating agencies have ranked the counterparty as investment grade.  To the extent credit ratings are not available, the Registrants utilize other credit quality indicators to determine the level of risk associated with the financing receivable.  Internal grade 1 may include financing receivables for counterparties for which credit rating agencies have ranked the counterparty as below investment grade; however, due to favorable information on other credit quality indicators, the Registrants have determined the risk level to be similar to that of an investment grade counterparty.  Internal grade 2 includes financing receivables for counterparties with limited credit information and those with a higher risk profile based upon credit quality indicators.  Internal grade 3 reflects financing receivables for which the counterparties have the greatest level of risk, including those in bankruptcy status.\n77\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following represents the Registrants' financing receivables by year of origination, classified by internal grade of credit risk, including current year-to-date gross write-offs, if any.  \nThe related credit quality indicators and risk ratings utilized to develop the internal grades have been updated through December 31, 2024.\nDTE Energy\nDTE Electric\nYear of origination\n2024\n2023\n2022 and prior\nTotal\n2024 and prior\n(In millions)\nNotes receivable\nInternal grade 1\n(a)\n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n43\n \nInternal grade 2\n622\n \n6\n \n253\n \n881\n \n1\n \nTotal notes receivable\n(b)\n$\n622\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n257\n \n$\n886\n \n$\n44\n \nNet investment in leases\nInternal grade 1\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n—\n \nInternal grade 2\n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \nTotal net investment in leases\n(b)\n$\n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n40\n \n$\n—\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nFor DTE Electric, includes Notes receivable — Affiliates balance of $\n42\n million originated in 2024 that eliminates in consolidation for DTE Energy.  Remaining balance for DTE Electric originated in 2023.\n(b)\nFor DTE Energy, the current portion is included in Current Assets — Other on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  For DTE Electric, the amounts are included in Other Assets — Other on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable for the utility entities is generally calculated using an aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies.  DTE Electric and DTE Gas establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses and management's assessment of existing and future economic conditions, customer trends and other factors.  Customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the due date, which is typically in \n21\n days, however, factors such as assistance programs may delay aggressive action.  DTE Electric and DTE Gas generally assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on past-due terms with customers.  Customer accounts are written off when collection efforts have been exhausted.  The time period for write-off is \n150\n days after service has been terminated.\nThe customer allowance for doubtful accounts for non-utility businesses and other receivables for both utility and non-utility businesses is generally calculated based on specific review of probable future collections based on receivable balances generally in excess of \n30\n days.  Existing and future economic conditions, customer trends and other factors are also considered.  Receivables are written off on a specific identification basis and determined based upon the specific circumstances of the associated receivable.\nNotes receivable for DTE Energy are primarily comprised of finance lease receivables and loans that are included in Notes Receivable and Other current assets on DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  Notes receivable for DTE Electric are primarily comprised of loans.\nThe Registrants establish an allowance for credit loss for principal and interest amounts due that are estimated to be uncollectible in accordance with the contractual terms of the note receivable.  In determining the allowance for credit losses for notes receivable, the Registrants consider the historical payment experience and other factors that are expected to have a specific impact on the counterparty's ability to pay including existing and future economic conditions.  Notes receivable are typically considered delinquent when payment is not received for periods ranging from \n60\n to \n120\n days.  If amounts are no longer probable of collection, the Registrants may consider the note receivable impaired, adjust the allowance, and cease accruing interest (nonaccrual status).\nCash payments received on nonaccrual status notes receivable, that do not bring the account contractually current, are first applied to the contractually owed past due interest, with any remainder applied to principal.  Accrual of interest is generally resumed when the note receivable becomes contractually current.\n78\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following tables present a roll-forward of the activity for the Registrants' financing receivables credit loss reserves:\nDTE Energy\nDTE Electric\nTrade accounts receivable\nOther receivables\nTotal\nTrade and other accounts receivable\n(In millions)\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n$\n89\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n92\n \n$\n54\n \nCurrent period provision\n49\n \n—\n \n49\n \n33\n \nWrite-offs charged against allowance\n(\n105\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n107\n)\n(\n66\n)\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off\n45\n \n—\n \n45\n \n28\n \nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n78\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n79\n \n$\n49\n \nCurrent period provision\n52\n \n—\n \n52\n \n36\n \nWrite-offs charged against allowance\n(\n112\n)\n—\n \n(\n112\n)\n(\n72\n)\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off\n44\n \n—\n \n44\n \n28\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n62\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n41\n \nCurrent period provision\n74\n \n2\n \n76\n \n49\n \nWrite-offs charged against allowance\n(\n108\n)\n—\n \n(\n108\n)\n(\n70\n)\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off\n41\n \n—\n \n41\n \n26\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n69\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n72\n \n$\n46\n \nUncollectible expense for the Registrants is primarily comprised of the current period provision for allowance for doubtful accounts and is summarized as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nDTE Energy\n$\n74\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n55\n \nDTE Electric\n$\n50\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n35\n \nThere are \nno\n material amounts of past due financing receivables for the Registrants as of December 31, 2024.\nInventories\nInventory related to utility and non-utility operations is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, where cost is generally valued using average cost.  Inventory primarily includes fuel, gas, materials, and supplies.  Other inventories include RECs, emission allowances, and other environmental products in the Energy Trading segment.\nDTE Gas' natural gas inventory includes $\n69\n million and $\n73\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.  The replacement cost of gas in inventory exceeded the LIFO cost by $\n81\n million and $\n50\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nProperty, Retirement and Maintenance, and Depreciation and Amortization\nProperty is stated at cost and includes construction-related labor, materials, overheads, and AFUDC for utility property.  The cost of utility properties retired is charged to accumulated depreciation.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.\nUtility property at DTE Electric and DTE Gas is depreciated over its estimated useful life using straight-line rates approved by the MPSC.  DTE Energy's non-utility property is depreciated over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method.  Depreciation and amortization expense also includes the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities for the Registrants.\nThe cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized.  The amortization of nuclear fuel is included within Fuel, purchased power, and gas \n—\n utility in the DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations, and Fuel and purchased power in the DTE Electric Consolidated Statements of Operations, and is recorded using the units-of-production method.\n79\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Property, Plant, and Equipment.\"\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset, an impairment loss is recognized resulting in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.\nGoodwill\nDTE Energy has goodwill resulting from business combinations.  For each reporting unit, DTE Energy performs an impairment test annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired.\n  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were \nno\n impairments resulting from these tests and there were \nno\n other changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Registrants have certain Intangible assets as shown below:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nUseful Lives\nGross Carrying Value\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Value\nGross Carrying Value\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Value\n(In millions)\nIntangible assets subject to amortization\nContract intangibles\n12\n to \n26\n years\n$\n246\n \n$\n(\n119\n)\n$\n127\n \n$\n246\n \n$\n(\n103\n)\n$\n143\n \nCarbon offsets\n14\n \n—\n \n14\n \n10\n \n— \n10\n \nRenewable energy credits\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n2\n \n— \n2\n \nOther\n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \n1\n \n— \n1\n \nIntangible assets not subject to amortization\n(a)\n17\n \n—\n \n17\n \n13\n \n— \n13\n \nDTE Energy Long-term intangible assets\n$\n263\n \n$\n(\n119\n)\n$\n144\n \n$\n259\n \n$\n(\n103\n)\n$\n156\n \n______________________________________\n(a)\nAmounts are charged to expense, using average cost, as they are consumed in the operation of the business.

Capitalized costs are recorded in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and amortization of the costs is reflected in Operation and maintenance within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.  Contracts primarily involve the implementation or upgrade of cloud-based solutions for generation and distribution operations and customer service support.\n80\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following balances for cloud computing costs relate to DTE Energy:\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nAmortization expense of capitalized cloud computing costs\n$\n12\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n4\n \nGross value of capitalized cloud computing costs\n$\n64\n \n$\n56\n \nAccumulated amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs\n$\n27\n \n$\n15\n \nThe following balances for cloud computing costs relate to DTE Electric:\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nAmortization expense of capitalized cloud computing costs\n$\n10\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n3\n \nGross value of capitalized cloud computing costs\n$\n51\n \n$\n44\n \nAccumulated amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs\n$\n22\n \n$\n12\n \nExcise and Sales Taxes\nThe Registrants record the billing of excise and sales taxes as a receivable with an offsetting payable to the applicable taxing authority, with \nno\n net impact on the Registrants’ Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDeferred Debt Costs\nThe costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the life of each debt issue.  The deferred amounts are included as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of each debt issue in Mortgage bonds, notes, and other and Securitization bonds on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and in Junior subordinated debentures on DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  In accordance with MPSC regulations applicable to DTE Energy’s electric and gas utilities, the unamortized discount, premium, and expense related to utility debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized over the life of the replacement issue.  Discounts, premiums, and expense on early redemptions of debt associated with DTE Energy's non-utility operations are charged to earnings.\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\nThe Registrants generally record investments in debt and equity securities at market value with unrealized gains or losses included in earnings.  Changes in the fair value of Fermi 2 nuclear decommissioning investments are recorded as adjustments to Regulatory assets or liabilities, due to a recovery mechanism from customers.  The Registrants' equity investments are reviewed for impairment each reporting period.  If the assessment indicates that an impairment exists, a loss is recognized resulting in the equity investment being written down to its estimated fair value.\n  See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value.\"\nDTE Energy Foundation\nDTE Energy made a charitable contribution to the DTE Energy Foundation of $\n10\n million for the year ended December 31, \n2024\n.

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services to the customer.  The Registrants recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  The Registrants have determined control to be transferred when the product is delivered, or the service is provided to the customer.\nRates for DTE Electric and DTE Gas include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel and purchased power costs, cost of natural gas, and certain other costs.  Revenues are adjusted for differences between actual costs subject to reconciliation and the amounts billed in current rates.  Under or over recovered revenues related to these cost recovery mechanisms are included in Regulatory assets or liabilities on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments to the billing factors.\nFor discussion of derivative contracts, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Financial and Other Derivative Instruments.\"\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following is a summary of revenues disaggregated by segment for DTE Energy:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nElectric\n(a)\nResidential\n$\n3,045\n \n$\n2,847\n \n$\n2,911\n \nCommercial\n2,263\n \n2,114\n \n1,958\n \nIndustrial\n715\n \n732\n \n659\n \nOther\n(b)\n270\n \n125\n \n884\n \nTotal Electric operating revenues\n$\n6,293\n \n$\n5,818\n \n$\n6,412\n \nGas\nGas sales\n$\n1,307\n \n$\n1,324\n \n$\n1,442\n \nEnd User Transportation\n246\n \n250\n \n264\n \nIntermediate Transportation\n83\n \n85\n \n81\n \nOther\n(b)\n162\n \n89\n \n137\n \nTotal Gas operating revenues\n$\n1,798\n \n$\n1,748\n \n$\n1,924\n \nOther segment operating revenues\nDTE Vantage\n$\n753\n \n$\n809\n \n$\n848\n \nEnergy Trading\n$\n3,843\n \n$\n4,612\n \n$\n10,308\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nRevenues generally represent those of DTE Electric, except $\n16\n million, $\n14\n million, and $\n15\n million of Other revenues related to DTE Sustainable Generation for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(b)\nIncludes revenue adjustments related to various regulatory mechanisms, including the PSCR at the Electric segment and GCR at the Gas segment.

For more detailed information about reportable segments, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Segment and Related Information.”\nThe Registrants have contracts with customers which may contain more than one performance obligation.  When more than one performance obligation exists in a contract, the consideration under the contract is allocated to the performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price.  DTE Energy generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or the use of the adjusted market assessment approach.  The adjusted market assessment approach involves the evaluation of the market in which DTE Energy sells goods or services and estimating the price that a customer in that market would be willing to pay.\nUnder Topic 606, when a customer simultaneously receives and consumes the product or service provided, revenue is considered to be recognized over time.  Alternatively, if it is determined that the criteria for recognition of revenue over time is not met, the revenue is considered to be recognized at a point in time.\nElectric segment\nThe Electric segment consists principally of DTE Electric.  Electric revenues are primarily comprised of the supply and delivery of electricity, related capacity, and RECs.  Revenues are primarily associated with cancellable contracts, with the exception of certain long-term contracts with commercial and industrial customers.  Revenues, including estimated unbilled amounts, are generally recognized over time based upon volumes delivered or through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service.  The Registrants have determined that the above methods represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer.  Unbilled revenues are typically determined utilizing approved tariff rates and estimated meter volumes.  Estimated unbilled amounts recognized in revenue are subject to adjustment in the following reporting period as actual volumes by customer class are known.  Revenues are typically subject to tariff rates based upon customer class and type of service and are billed and received monthly.  Tariff rates are determined by the MPSC on a per unit or monthly basis.\nGas segment\nThe Gas segment consists principally of DTE Gas.  Gas revenues are primarily comprised of the supply and delivery of natural gas, and other services including storage, transportation, and appliance maintenance.  Revenues are primarily associated with cancellable contracts, with the exception of certain long-term contracts with commercial and industrial customers.  Revenues, including estimated unbilled amounts, are generally recognized over time based upon volumes delivered or through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service.  DTE Energy has determined that the above methods represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer.  Unbilled revenues are typically determined using both estimated meter volumes and estimated usage based upon the number of unbilled days and historical temperatures.  Estimated unbilled amounts recognized in revenue are subject to adjustment in the following reporting period as actual volumes by customer class and service type are known.  Revenues are typically subject to tariff rates or other rates subject to regulatory oversight and are billed and received monthly.  Tariff rates are determined by the MPSC on a per unit or monthly basis.\nDTE Vantage segment\nThe DTE Vantage segment revenues include contracts accounted for as leases which are outside of the scope of Topic 606.  For performance obligations within the scope of Topic 606, the timing of revenue recognition is dependent upon when control over the associated product or service is transferred.\n84\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nRevenues at DTE Vantage, within the scope of Topic 606, generally consist of sales of blast furnace coke, renewable natural gas and related credits, electricity, equipment maintenance services, and other energy related products and services.  Revenues for the sale of blast furnace coke, including estimated unbilled amounts, are recognized at a point in time when the product is delivered, which represents the transfer of control to the customer.  Other revenues are generally recognized over time based upon volumes delivered or services provided, or through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service.  DTE Energy has determined that the above methods represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer.  Market based pricing structures exist in such contracts including adjustments for consumer price or other indices.  Consideration may consist of both fixed and variable components.  Generally, uncertainties in the variable consideration components are resolved, and revenues are known at the time of recognition.  Billing terms vary and are generally monthly with payment terms typically within \n30\n days following billing.\nEnergy Trading segment\nThe Energy Trading segment revenues consist primarily of derivative contracts outside of the scope of Topic 606.  For performance obligations within the scope of Topic 606, the timing of revenue recognition is dependent upon when control over the associated product or service is transferred.\nRevenues, including estimated unbilled amounts, within the scope of Topic 606 arising from the sale of natural gas, electricity, power capacity, and other energy related products are generally recognized over time based upon volumes delivered or through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service.  DTE Energy has determined that the above methods represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer.  Revenues are known at the time of recognition.  Payment for the aforementioned revenues is generally due from customers in the month following delivery.\nRevenues associated with RECs and other environmental products are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer which is deemed to be when these products are entered for transfer to the customer in the applicable tracking system.  Revenues associated with RECs under a wholesale full requirements power contract are deferred until control has been transferred.  The deferred revenues represent a contract liability for which payment has been received and the amounts have been estimated using the adjusted market assessment approach.  With the exception of RECs, generally all other performance obligations associated with wholesale full requirements power contracts are satisfied over time in conjunction with the delivery of power.  At the time power is delivered, DTE Energy may not have control over the RECs as the RECs are not self-generated and may not yet have been procured resulting in deferred revenues.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe following is a summary of deferred revenue activity for DTE Energy:\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nBeginning Balance, January 1\n$\n106\n \n$\n94\n \nIncreases due to cash received or receivable, excluding amounts recognized as revenue during the period\n132\n \n103\n \nRevenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period\n(\n100\n)\n(\n91\n)\nEnding Balance, December 31\n$\n138\n \n$\n106\n \nDeferred revenues are included in Current Liabilities — Other and Other Liabilities — Other on DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  Deferred revenues generally represent amounts paid by or receivables from customers for which the associated performance obligation has not yet been satisfied.  Deferred revenues include amounts associated with REC performance obligations under certain wholesale full requirements power contracts.  Deferred revenues related to RECs are recognized as revenue when control of the RECs has transferred.  Other performance obligations associated with deferred revenues include providing products and services related to customer prepayments.  Deferred revenues associated with these products and services are recognized when control has transferred to the customer.\n85\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following table represents deferred revenue amounts for DTE Energy that are expected to be recognized as revenue in future periods:\nDTE Energy\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n135\n \n2026\n1\n \n2027\n1\n \n2028\n1\n \n2029\n—\n \n2030 and thereafter\n—\n \n$\n138\n \nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\nIn accordance with optional exemptions available under Topic 606, the Registrants did not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (1) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, (2) with the exception of fixed consideration, contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Registrants have the right to invoice for goods provided and services performed, and (3) contracts for which variable consideration relates entirely to an unsatisfied performance obligation.\nSuch contracts consist of varying types of performance obligations across the segments, including the supply and delivery of energy related products and services.  Contracts with variable volumes and/or variable pricing, including those with pricing provisions tied to a consumer price or other index, have also been excluded as the related consideration under the contract is variable at inception of the contract.  Contract lengths vary from cancellable to multi-year.\nThe Registrants expect to recognize revenue for the following amounts related to fixed consideration associated with remaining performance obligations in each of the future periods noted:\nDTE Energy\nDTE Electric\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n225\n \n$\n1\n \n2026\n170\n \n—\n \n2027\n133\n \n—\n \n2028\n90\n \n—\n \n2029\n77\n \n—\n \n2030 and thereafter\n327\n \n—\n \n$\n1,022\n \n$\n1\n \n86\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nNOTE 5 — \nPROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following is a summary of Property, plant, and equipment by classification as of December 31:\n2024\n2023\nProperty, plant, and equipment\n(In millions)\nDTE Electric\nDistribution\n$\n14,995\n \n$\n13,673\n \nDispatchable generation\n8,428\n \n7,969\n \nRenewable generation\n3,933\n \n3,074\n \nOther\n3,445\n \n3,220\n \nTotal DTE Electric\n30,801\n \n27,936\n \nDTE Gas\nDistribution\n6,334\n \n5,838\n \nTransmission\n1,212\n \n1,132\n \nStorage\n586\n \n578\n \nOther\n500\n \n481\n \nTotal DTE Gas\n8,632\n \n8,029\n \nDTE Vantage\n1,135\n \n1,075\n \nOther\n272\n \n234\n \nTotal DTE Energy\n$\n40,840\n \n$\n37,274\n \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\nDTE Electric\nDistribution\n$\n(\n3,513\n)\n$\n(\n3,205\n)\nDispatchable generation\n(\n2,146\n)\n(\n1,872\n)\nRenewable generation\n(\n615\n)\n(\n524\n)\nOther\n(\n1,130\n)\n(\n969\n)\nTotal DTE Electric\n(\n7,404\n)\n(\n6,570\n)\nDTE Gas\nDistribution\n(\n1,319\n)\n(\n1,365\n)\nTransmission\n(\n278\n)\n(\n300\n)\nStorage\n(\n138\n)\n(\n132\n)\nOther\n(\n210\n)\n(\n193\n)\nTotal DTE Gas\n(\n1,945\n)\n(\n1,990\n)\nDTE Vantage\n(\n520\n)\n(\n479\n)\nOther\n(\n78\n)\n(\n66\n)\nTotal DTE Energy\n$\n(\n9,947\n)\n$\n(\n9,105\n)\nNet DTE Energy Property, plant, and equipment\n$\n30,893\n \n$\n28,169\n \nNet DTE Electric Property, plant, and equipment\n$\n23,397\n \n$\n21,366\n \nAFUDC and Capitalized Interest\nAFUDC represents the cost of financing construction projects for regulated businesses, including the estimated cost of debt and authorized return on equity.

DTE Electric has conditional retirement obligations for asbestos and PCB removal at certain of its power plants and various distribution equipment.  DTE Gas has conditional retirement obligations for gas pipelines, certain service centers, and compressor and gate stations.  The Registrants recognize such obligations as liabilities at fair market value when they are incurred, which generally is at the time the associated assets are placed in service.  Fair value is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the Registrants' credit-adjusted risk-free rate.  For its utility operations, the Registrants recognize in the Consolidated Statements of Operations removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment.  Any differences between costs recognized related to asset retirement and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a Regulatory asset or liability on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nIf a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred, such as for assets with indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.  Natural gas storage system and certain other distribution assets for DTE Gas and substations, manholes, and certain other distribution assets for DTE Electric have an indeterminate life.  Therefore, no liability has been recorded for these assets.\nChanges to Asset retirement obligations for 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDTE Energy\n(In millions)\nAsset retirement obligations at January 1\n$\n3,556\n \n$\n3,460\n \n$\n3,162\n \nAccretion\n211\n \n198\n \n184\n \nLiabilities incurred\n(a)\n324\n \n7\n \n24\n \nLiabilities settled\n(\n14\n)\n(\n96\n)\n(\n7\n)\nRevision in estimated cash flows\n(\n46\n)\n(\n13\n)\n97\n \nAsset retirement obligations at December 31\n$\n4,031\n \n$\n3,556\n \n$\n3,460\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nLiabilities incurred was primarily due to the impact of the Coal Combustion Residuals on DTE Electric's coal ash storage facility asset retirement obligations.

The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and requires minimum decommissioning funding based upon a formula.  The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi 2.  Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level radioactive waste.  DTE Electric believes the MPSC collections will be adequate to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning.  The decommissioning assets, anticipated earnings thereon, and future revenues from decommissioning collections will be used to decommission Fermi 2.  DTE Electric expects the liabilities to be reduced to \nzero\n at the conclusion of the decommissioning activities.  If amounts remain in the trust funds for Fermi 2 following the completion of the decommissioning activities, those amounts will be disbursed based on rulings by the MPSC and FERC.\nA portion of the funds recovered through the Fermi 2 decommissioning surcharge and deposited in external trust accounts is designated for the removal of non-radioactive assets and returning the site to greenfield.  This removal and greenfielding is not considered a legal liability.  Therefore, it is not included in the asset retirement obligation, but is reflected as the Nuclear decommissioning liability.  The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by DTE Electric.  Contributions to the Fermi 1 trust are discretionary.  For additional discussion of Nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value.\"\nNOTE 8 — \nREGULATORY MATTERS\nRegulation\nDTE Electric and DTE Gas are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting, and operating-related matters.  The MPSC has authorized a return on equity of \n9.9\n% for DTE Electric and \n9.8\n% for DTE Gas, subject to changes from any pending or future rate case filings.  DTE Electric is also regulated by the FERC with respect to financing authorization, wholesale electric market activities, certain affiliate transactions, the acquisition and disposition of certain generation and other facilities, and, in conjunction with the NERC, compliance with mandatory reliability standards.  Regulation results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses.\nThe Registrants are unable to predict the outcome of any unresolved regulatory matters discussed herein.  Resolution of these matters is dependent upon future MPSC and FERC orders and appeals, which may materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Registrants.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nDTE Electric and DTE Gas are required to record Regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses.  Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and be charged to and collected from customers.  Future regulatory changes could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for Regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Registrants' businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any Regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates.  Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of Regulatory assets and liabilities and that all Regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current regulatory environment.\n91\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following are balances and a brief description of the Registrants' Regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31:\nDTE Energy\nDTE Electric\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAssets\n(In millions)\nRecoverable undepreciated costs on retiring plants\n$\n2,986\n \n$\n2,736\n \n$\n2,986\n \n$\n2,736\n \nRecoverable pension and other postretirement costs\nPension\n1,315\n \n1,421\n \n971\n \n1,045\n \nOther postretirement costs\n91\n \n163\n \n—\n \n67\n \nFermi 2 asset retirement obligation\n951\n \n952\n \n951\n \n952\n \nRemoval costs asset\n501\n \n223\n \n501\n \n223\n \nEnhanced tree trimming program deferred costs\n211\n \n157\n \n211\n \n157\n \nRecoverable Michigan income taxes\n119\n \n133\n \n99\n \n110\n \nRecoverable income taxes related to AFUDC equity\n116\n \n89\n \n107\n \n80\n \nEnergy Waste Reduction incentive\n102\n \n90\n \n82\n \n72\n \nRenewable ITC offset\n89\n \n—\n \n89\n \n—\n \nDeferred environmental costs\n43\n \n46\n \n—\n \n—\n \nUnamortized loss on reacquired debt\n38\n \n41\n \n29\n \n31\n \nCustomer360 deferred costs\n34\n \n38\n \n34\n \n38\n \nLudington contract dispute costs\n31\n \n10\n \n31\n \n10\n \nAccrued PSCR/GCR revenue\n—\n \n55\n \n—\n \n55\n \nOther\n194\n \n163\n \n135\n \n119\n \n6,821\n \n6,317\n \n6,226\n \n5,695\n \nLess amount included in Current Assets\n(\n50\n)\n(\n108\n)\n(\n39\n)\n(\n99\n)\n$\n6,771\n \n$\n6,209\n \n$\n6,187\n \n$\n5,596\n \nSecuritized regulatory assets\n$\n690\n \n$\n758\n \n$\n690\n \n$\n758\n \nDTE Energy\nDTE Electric\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nLiabilities\n(In millions)\nRefundable federal income taxes\n$\n1,733\n \n$\n1,823\n \n$\n1,389\n \n$\n1,463\n \nRemoval costs liability\n506\n \n342\n \n—\n \n—\n \nNon-service pension and other postretirement costs\n255\n \n199\n \n94\n \n84\n \nNegative other postretirement offset\n214\n \n210\n \n139\n \n142\n \nAccrued PSCR/GCR refund\n136\n \n21\n \n111\n \n—\n \nRenewable energy\n90\n \n7\n \n90\n \n7\n \nOther\n103\n \n72\n \n86\n \n63\n \n3,037\n \n2,674\n \n1,909\n \n1,759\n \nLess amount included in Current Liabilities\n(\n181\n)\n(\n71\n)\n(\n156\n)\n(\n49\n)\n$\n2,856\n \n$\n2,603\n \n$\n1,753\n \n$\n1,710\n \nAs noted below, certain Regulatory assets for which costs have been incurred have been included (or are expected to be included, for costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate case) in DTE Electric's or DTE Gas' rate base, thereby providing a return on invested costs (except as noted).  Certain other Regulatory assets are not included in rate base but accrue recoverable carrying charges until surcharges to collect the assets are billed.  Certain Regulatory assets do not result from cash expenditures and therefore do not represent investments included in rate base or have offsetting liabilities that reduce rate base.\n92\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nASSETS\n•\nRecoverable undepreciated costs on retiring plants\n — Undepreciated costs at the Belle River and Monroe power plants that will be retired in future periods.  These costs were approved for recovery as a result of DTE Electric's Integrated Resource Plan settlement agreement in 2023.  The Belle River power plant will be retired in 2025-2026 and the Monroe power plant will be retired in 2032.  Amounts will be recovered in the future through securitization and amortization.\n•\nRecoverable pension and other postretirement costs\n — Accounting standards for pension and other postretirement benefit costs require, among other things, the recognition in Other comprehensive income of the actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs that arise during the period but are not immediately recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs (credits).  DTE Electric and DTE Gas record the impact of actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs as Regulatory assets or Regulatory liabilities since the traditional rate setting process allows for the recovery of pension and other postretirement costs.  The asset and liability will reverse as the deferred items are amortized and recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs (credits).  Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Retirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets,\" for additional information regarding the changes in pension and other postretirement costs for the period and the impact on Regulatory assets.\n(a)\n•\nFermi 2 asset retirement obligation\n — Obligation for Fermi 2 decommissioning costs.  The asset captures the timing differences between expense recognition and current recovery in rates and will reverse over the remaining life of the related plant.\n(a)\n•\nRemoval costs asset\n — Receivable for the recovery of asset removal expenditures in excess of amounts collected from customers.\n•\nEnhanced tree trimming program deferred costs\n — The MPSC approved the deferral of costs for a tree trimming surge through 2025, aimed at reducing the number and duration of customer interruptions.\n•\nRecoverable Michigan income taxes\n — The State of Michigan enacted a corporate income tax resulting in the establishment of state deferred tax liabilities for DTE Energy's utilities.  Offsetting Regulatory assets were also recorded as the impacts of the deferred tax liabilities will be reflected in rates as the related taxable temporary differences reverse and flow through current income tax expense.\n•\nRecoverable income taxes related to AFUDC equity\n — Accounting standards for income taxes require recognition of a deferred tax liability for the equity component of AFUDC.  A Regulatory asset is required for the future increase in taxes payable related to the equity component of AFUDC that will be recovered from customers through future rates over the remaining life of the related plant.\n•\nEnergy Waste Reduction incentive\n — DTE Electric and DTE Gas operate MPSC approved energy waste reduction programs designed to reduce overall energy usage by their customers.  The utilities are eligible to earn an incentive by exceeding statutory savings targets.  The utilities have consistently exceeded the savings targets and recognize the incentive as a Regulatory asset in the period earned.\n(a)\n•\nRenewable ITC offset\n — DTE Electric's accounting policy for ITCs is to use the deferral method where the ITC benefit is deferred and amortized to net income over the book life of the related property.  For an ITC that is sold, this regulatory asset is used to adjust net income to reflect the benefit over a period shorter than the book life, as approved by the MPSC.\n(a)\n•\nDeferred environmental costs\n — The MPSC approved the deferral of investigation and remediation costs associated with DTE Gas' former MGP sites.  Amortization of deferred costs is over a \nten-year\n period beginning in the year after costs were incurred, with recovery (net of any insurance proceeds) through base rate filings.\n(a)\n•\nUnamortized loss on reacquired debt\n — The unamortized discount, premium, and expense related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are deferred, amortized, and recovered over the life of the replacement issue.\n93\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\n•\nCustomer360 deferred costs\n — The MPSC approved the deferral and amortization of certain costs associated with implementing Customer360, an integrated software application that enables improved interface among customer service, billing, meter reading, credit and collections, device management, account management, and retail access.  Amortization of deferred costs over a \n15\n-year amortization period began after the billing system was put into operation during the second quarter of 2017.  The deferred costs are recorded as Regulatory Assets at DTE Electric and DTE Gas receives an intercompany charge for their proportionate share of amortization expense.\n•\nLudington contract dispute costs\n — The MPSC approved the deferral of costs incurred for repairing or replacing defective work performed by a third party related to the overhaul and upgrade of the Ludington Hydroelectric Pumped Storage Plant while the dispute is in litigation.  These costs will be offset by any potential future proceeds received related to the litigation.  Upon resolution of the dispute, DTE Electric will have the opportunity to seek recovery through the regulatory process for any remaining costs.  Refer to the \nLudington Plant Contract Dispute\n section of Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for additional information regarding the complaint and ongoing legal proceedings.\n•\nAccrued PSCR/GCR revenue\n — Receivable for the temporary under-recovery of and carrying costs on fuel and purchased power costs incurred by DTE Electric which are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism and temporary under-recovery of and carrying costs on gas costs incurred by DTE Gas which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.\n•\nSecuritized regulatory assets\n — Costs approved for securitization and recovery by the MPSC.  Amounts include the undepreciated cost of the River Rouge power plant and tree trim surge costs.  Securitization bond surcharges began in 2022 to recover the tree trimming costs over a period not to exceed \n5\n years and River Rouge costs over a period not to exceed \n14\n years.  Amounts also include the undepreciated costs of the St. Clair and Trenton Channel power plants.  Securitization bond surcharges began in 2023 to recover costs over a period not to exceed \n15\n years.\n________________________________________________\n(a)\nRegulatory assets not earning a return or accruing carrying charges.\nLIABILITIES\n•\nRefundable federal income taxes\n — In December 2017, the TCJA was enacted and reduced the corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018.  DTE Electric and DTE Gas remeasured deferred taxes, resulting in a reduction to deferred tax liabilities, to reflect the impact of the TCJA on the cumulative temporary differences expected to reverse after the effective date.  Regulatory liabilities were also recorded to offset the impact of the deferred tax remeasurement reflected in rates.\n•\nRemoval costs liability\n — The amounts collected from customers to fund future asset removal activities in excess of removal costs incurred.\n•\nNon-service pension and other postretirement costs\n \n—\n Upon adoption of ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018, certain non-service pension and other postretirement cost activity is no longer credited to Property, plant, and equipment.  Such costs may be recorded to Regulatory liabilities for ratemaking purposes and refunded through credits to amortization expense based on the composite depreciation rate for plant-in-service.\n•\nNegative other postretirement offset\n — DTE Electric and DTE Gas' negative other postretirement costs have historically not been included as a reduction to their authorized rates; therefore, DTE Electric and DTE Gas have accrued a Regulatory liability to eliminate the impact on earnings of the negative other postretirement expense accrual.  The Regulatory liabilities may reverse to the extent DTE Electric and DTE Gas' other postretirement expense is positive in future years.  As a result of MPSC orders, the Regulatory liability balances as of December 31, 2022 began to be amortized over a \n7\n-year period for both DTE Electric and DTE Gas.\n•\nAccrued PSCR/GCR refund — \nLiability for the temporary over-recovery of and a return on power supply costs and transmission costs incurred by DTE Electric which are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism and temporary over-recovery of and a return on gas costs primarily incurred by DTE Gas which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.\n•\nRenewable energy —\n Amounts collected in excess of renewable energy expenditures, including subscription revenue related to MIGreenPower, DTE Electric's voluntary renewable program providing customers the option to source their energy usage from renewables.\n94\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\n2024 Gas Rate Case Filing\nDTE Gas filed a rate case with the MPSC on January 8, 2024 requesting an increase in base rates of $\n266\n million based on a projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2025, and an increase in return on equity from \n9.9\n% to \n10.25\n%.  The request reflected a net increase to customer rates of only $\n160\n million, as an existing IRM surcharge of $\n106\n million would be rolled into the new base rates.  The requested increase was primarily due to increased investments in plant related to system reliability and pipeline safety and inflationary impacts on operating costs, partially offset by higher sales.  On November 7, 2024, the MPSC issued an order approving an annual revenue increase of $\n114\n million for services rendered on or after November 21, 2024 and a return on equity of \n9.8\n%.\n2024 Electric Rate Case Filing\nDTE Electric filed a rate case with the MPSC on March 28, 2024 requesting an increase in base rates of $\n456\n million based on a projected twelve-month period ending December 31, 2025, and an increase in return on equity from \n9.9\n% to \n10.5\n%.  The requested increase in base rates was primarily due to the capital investments required to support continued reliability improvements and the ongoing transition to cleaner energy.  The requested increase in base rates was also due to the increased cost of debt resulting from market dynamics and increasing operating and maintenance expenses.\nOn January 23, 2025, the MPSC issued an order approving an annual revenue increase of $\n217\n million for services rendered on or after February 6, 2025 and a return on equity of \n9.9\n%.  The MPSC order also disallowed $\n12\n million of capital expenditures previously recorded, primarily related to various IT projects.  The disallowance was included in Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nNOTE 9 — \nINCOME TAXES\nIncome Tax Summary\nDTE Energy files a consolidated federal income tax return.

No valuation allowance is required for the federal net operating loss deferred tax asset. \nDTE Energy has state and local deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards of $\n68\n million and $\n76\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Most of the state and local net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2025 through 2046 with the remainder being carried forward indefinitely.\nDTE Energy has recorded valuation allowances of $\n25\n million and $\n39\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The valuation allowances include $\n16\n million and $\n19\n million related to the state net operating loss carryforwards noted above and $\n3\n million and $\n20\n million related to charitable contribution carryforwards as of the respective periods ended.\nTax credit carryforwards for DTE Electric include $\n583\n million of general business credits that expire from 2036 through 2046.  No valuation allowance is required for the tax credit carryforwards deferred tax asset.\nDTE Electric has a pre-tax federal net operating loss carryforward of $\n142\n million as of December 31, 2024 which can be carried forward indefinitely.  No valuation allowance is required for the federal net operating loss deferred tax asset.\nDTE Electric has $\n42\n million and $\n49\n million in state and local deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which will expire from 2030 through 2042.  No valuation allowance is required for the state and local net operating loss deferred tax assets.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, DTE Energy considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.\nThe above tables exclude unamortized ITCs that are shown separately on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  DTE Energy's policy election is to follow the flow-through method of accounting for ITCs earned from its non-utility businesses and the deferral method of accounting for its regulated utilities due to different economic profiles of the various entities.  The flow-through method used by the non-utility businesses recognizes ITCs in earnings when the related assets are placed in service.  The ITCs generated by the regulated utilities are deferred and amortized to earnings over the average life of the related property.  ITCs generated and sold by the regulated utilities are offset with a regulatory asset to give the benefit to customers over a period shorter than the book life, as approved by the MPSC.  Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" for the regulatory asset balance at December 31, 2024.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThere were \nno\n unrecognized tax benefits at the Registrants for the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nThe Registrants recognize interest and penalties pertaining to income taxes in Interest expense and Other expenses, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  DTE Energy did \nnot\n recognize any interest expense related to income taxes in 2024 and recognized a \nnominal\n amount of interest expense related to income taxes in 2023 and 2022.  DTE Electric did \nnot\n recognize any interest expense related to income taxes in 2024 and recognized a \nnominal\n amount of interest expense in 2023 and $\n1\n million in 2022.  There was \nno\n accrued interest or penalties pertaining to income taxes for the Registrants at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  Accrued interest pertaining to income taxes at December 31, 2022 was $\n5\n million and $\n8\n million for DTE Energy and DTE Electric, respectively.  There were \nno\n accrued penalties pertaining to income taxes for the Registrants at December 31, 2022.\nIn 2024, DTE Energy, including DTE Electric, settled a federal tax audit for the 2022 tax year.  DTE Energy's federal income tax returns for 2023 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the IRS.  DTE Energy's Michigan Corporate Income Tax returns for the year 2019 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the State of Michigan.  DTE Energy also files tax returns in numerous state and local jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation.\n98\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nNOTE 10 — \nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income, adjusted for income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share reflect the dilution that would occur if any potentially dilutive instruments were exercised or converted into common shares.  DTE Energy's participating securities are restricted shares under the stock incentive program that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends.  Performance shares do not receive cash dividends; as such, these awards are not considered participating securities.

Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities.  These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable inputs.  The Registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques.  Credit risk of the Registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact of which was immaterial at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  The Registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nA fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  All assets and liabilities are required to be classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Assessing the significance of a particular input may require judgment considering factors specific to the asset or liability and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and its placement within the fair value hierarchy.  The Registrants classify fair value balances based on the fair value hierarchy defined as follows:\n•\nLevel 1\n — Consists of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to access as of the reporting date.\n•\nLevel 2\n — Consists of inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.\n•\nLevel 3\n — Consists of unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that are generally less readily observable and supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date.  Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best available information and subject to cost-benefit constraints.\n100\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following table presents assets and liabilities for DTE Energy measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel\n 2\nLevel 3\nOther\n(a)\nNetting\n(b)\nNet Balance\nLevel 1\nLevel\n 2\nLevel 3\nOther\n(a)\nNetting\n(b)\nNet Balance\n(In millions)\nAssets\nCash equivalents\n(c)\n$\n11\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n13\n \nNuclear decommissioning trusts\nEquity securities\n856\n \n—\n \n—\n \n147\n \n—\n \n1,003\n \n776\n \n—\n \n—\n \n145\n \n— \n921\n \nFixed income securities\n124\n \n414\n \n—\n \n112\n \n—\n \n650\n \n127\n \n371\n \n—\n \n92\n \n— \n590\n \nPrivate equity and other\n16\n \n—\n \n—\n \n333\n \n—\n \n349\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n312\n \n— \n312\n \nHedge funds and similar investments\n151\n \n16\n \n—\n \n61\n \n—\n \n228\n \n119\n \n65\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n184\n \nCash equivalents\n26\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n26\n \n34\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n— \n34\n \nOther investments\n(d)\nEquity securities\n72\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n72\n \n58\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n— \n58\n \nFixed income securities\n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n7\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n— \n7\n \nCash equivalents\n29\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n29\n \n37\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n— \n37\n \nDerivative assets\nCommodity contracts\n(e)\nNatural gas\n242\n \n81\n \n105\n \n—\n \n(\n285\n)\n143\n \n241\n \n217\n \n179\n \n— \n(\n416\n)\n221\n \nElectricity\n67\n \n69\n \n51\n \n—\n \n(\n116\n)\n71\n \n—\n \n258\n \n163\n \n— \n(\n243\n)\n178\n \nEnvironmental & Other\n1\n \n47\n \n10\n \n—\n \n(\n46\n)\n12\n \n—\n \n131\n \n8\n \n— \n(\n132\n)\n7\n \nOther contracts\n—\n \n21\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n21\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal derivative assets\n310\n \n218\n \n166\n \n—\n \n(\n447\n)\n247\n \n241\n \n606\n \n350\n \n— \n(\n791\n)\n406\n \nTotal\n$\n1,602\n \n$\n648\n \n$\n166\n \n$\n653\n \n$\n(\n447\n)\n$\n2,622\n \n$\n1,412\n \n$\n1,042\n \n$\n350\n \n$\n549\n \n$\n(\n791\n)\n$\n2,562\n \nLiabilities\nDerivative liabilities\nCommodity contracts\n(e)\nNatural gas\n$\n(\n217\n)\n$\n(\n70\n)\n$\n(\n123\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n272\n \n$\n(\n138\n)\n$\n(\n291\n)\n$\n(\n167\n)\n$\n(\n157\n)\n$\n— \n$\n429\n \n$\n(\n186\n)\nElectricity\n(\n71\n)\n(\n52\n)\n(\n27\n)\n—\n \n114\n \n(\n36\n)\n—\n \n(\n272\n)\n(\n116\n)\n— \n297\n \n(\n91\n)\nEnvironmental & Other\n(\n2\n)\n(\n39\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n44\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n148\n)\n(\n2\n)\n— \n137\n \n(\n13\n)\nOther contracts\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n19\n)\n—\n \n— \n—\n \n(\n19\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n290\n)\n$\n(\n162\n)\n$\n(\n153\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n430\n \n$\n(\n175\n)\n$\n(\n291\n)\n$\n(\n606\n)\n$\n(\n275\n)\n$\n— \n$\n863\n \n$\n(\n309\n)\nNet Assets (Liabilities) at end of period\n$\n1,312\n \n$\n486\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n653\n \n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n2,447\n \n$\n1,121\n \n$\n436\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n549\n \n$\n72\n \n$\n2,253\n \nAssets\nCurrent\n$\n223\n \n$\n170\n \n$\n106\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n326\n)\n$\n173\n \n$\n215\n \n$\n461\n \n$\n247\n \n$\n— \n$\n(\n613\n)\n$\n310\n \nNoncurrent\n1,379\n \n478\n \n60\n \n653\n \n(\n121\n)\n2,449\n \n1,197\n \n581\n \n103\n \n549\n \n(\n178\n)\n2,252\n \nTotal Assets\n$\n1,602\n \n$\n648\n \n$\n166\n \n$\n653\n \n$\n(\n447\n)\n$\n2,622\n \n$\n1,412\n \n$\n1,042\n \n$\n350\n \n$\n549\n \n$\n(\n791\n)\n$\n2,562\n \nLiabilities\nCurrent\n$\n(\n219\n)\n$\n(\n129\n)\n$\n(\n93\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n323\n \n$\n(\n118\n)\n$\n(\n240\n)\n$\n(\n462\n)\n$\n(\n145\n)\n$\n— \n$\n670\n \n$\n(\n177\n)\nNoncurrent\n(\n71\n)\n(\n33\n)\n(\n60\n)\n—\n \n107\n \n(\n57\n)\n(\n51\n)\n(\n144\n)\n(\n130\n)\n— \n193\n \n(\n132\n)\nTotal Liabilities\n$\n(\n290\n)\n$\n(\n162\n)\n$\n(\n153\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n430\n \n$\n(\n175\n)\n$\n(\n291\n)\n$\n(\n606\n)\n$\n(\n275\n)\n$\n— \n$\n863\n \n$\n(\n309\n)\nNet Assets (Liabilities) at end of period\n$\n1,312\n \n$\n486\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n653\n \n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n2,447\n \n$\n1,121\n \n$\n436\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n549\n \n$\n72\n \n$\n2,253\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nAmounts represent assets valued at NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.\n(b)\nAmounts represent the impact of master netting agreements that allow DTE Energy to net gain and loss positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.\n(c)\nAmounts include $\n8\n million and $\n11\n million recorded in Restricted cash on DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

All other amounts are included in Cash and cash equivalents on DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.  The cash equivalents shown in the fair value table are comprised of short-term investments in money market funds.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trusts and Other Investments\nThe nuclear decommissioning trusts and other investments hold debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds.  Exchange-traded debt and equity securities held directly, as well as publicly traded commingled funds, are valued using quoted market prices in actively traded markets.  Non-exchange traded fixed income securities are valued based upon quotations available from brokers or pricing services.  \nNon-publicly traded commingled funds holding exchange-traded equity or debt securities are valued based on stated NAVs.  There are no significant restrictions for these funds and investments may be redeemed with \n7\n to \n65\n days notice depending on the fund.  There is no intention to sell the investment in these commingled funds.\nPrivate equity and other assets include a diversified group of funds that are primarily classified as NAV assets.  These funds primarily invest in limited partnerships, including private equity, private real estate and private credit.  Distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying fund assets over the life of the funds.  There are generally no redemption rights.  The limited partner must hold the fund for its life or find a third-party buyer, which may need to be approved by the general partner.  The funds are established with varied contractual durations generally in the range of \n7\n years to \n12\n years.  The fund life can often be extended by several years by the general partner, and further extended with the approval of the limited partners.  Unfunded commitments related to these investments totaled $\n120\n million and $\n157\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n102\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nHedge funds and similar investments utilize a diversified group of strategies that attempt to capture uncorrelated sources of return.  These investments include publicly traded mutual funds that are valued using quoted prices in actively traded markets, as well as insurance-linked and asset-backed securities and that are valued using quotations from broker or pricing services and limited partnerships that are classified as NAV assets.\nFor pricing the nuclear decommissioning trusts and other investments, a primary price source is identified by asset type, class, or issue for each security.  The trustee monitors prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary source of a given security if the trustee determines that another price source is considered preferable.  The Registrants have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nDerivative assets and liabilities are comprised of physical and financial derivative contracts, including futures, forwards, options, and swaps that are both exchange-traded and over-the-counter traded contracts.  Various inputs are used to value derivatives depending on the type of contract and availability of market data.  Exchange-traded derivative contracts are valued using quoted prices in active markets.  The Registrants consider the following criteria in determining whether a market is considered active: frequency in which pricing information is updated, variability in pricing between sources or over time, and the availability of public information.  Other derivative contracts are valued based upon a variety of inputs including commodity market prices, broker quotes, interest rates, credit ratings, default rates, market-based seasonality, and basis differential factors.  The Registrants monitor the prices that are supplied by brokers and pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of an index if prices become unavailable or another price source is determined to be more representative of fair value.  The Registrants have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived.  Additionally, the Registrants selectively corroborate the fair value of their transactions by comparison of market-based price sources.  Mathematical valuation models are used for derivatives for which external market data is not readily observable, such as contracts which extend beyond the actively traded reporting period.  The Registrants have established a Risk Management Committee whose responsibilities include directly or indirectly ensuring all valuation methods are applied in accordance with predefined policies.  The development and maintenance of the Registrants' forward price curves has been assigned to DTE Energy's Risk Management Department, which is separate and distinct from the trading functions within DTE Energy.\nThe following table presents the fair value reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for DTE Energy:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nNatural Gas\nElectricity\nOther\nTotal\nNatural Gas\nElectricity\nOther\nTotal\n(In millions)\nNet Assets (Liabilities) as of January 1\n$\n22\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n(\n255\n)\n$\n(\n33\n)\n$\n11\n \n$\n(\n277\n)\nTransfers into Level 3 from Level 2\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTransfers from Level 3 into Level 2\n—\n \n74\n \n—\n \n74\n \n17\n \n—\n \n—\n \n17\n \nTotal gains (losses)\nIncluded in earnings\n(a)\n16\n \n225\n \n(\n1\n)\n240\n \n182\n \n198\n \n(\n1\n)\n379\n \nRecorded in Regulatory liabilities\n—\n \n—\n \n21\n \n21\n \n—\n \n—\n \n9\n \n9\n \nPurchases, issuances, and settlements:\nSettlements\n(\n57\n)\n(\n322\n)\n(\n19\n)\n(\n398\n)\n78\n \n(\n118\n)\n(\n13\n)\n(\n53\n)\nNet Assets (Liabilities) as of December 31\n$\n(\n18\n)\n$\n24\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n75\n \nTotal gains (losses) included in Net Income attributed to the change in unrealized gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities held at December 31\n(a)\n \n$\n(\n47\n)\n$\n118\n \n$\n(\n159\n)\n$\n(\n88\n)\n$\n85\n \n$\n151\n \n$\n(\n122\n)\n$\n114\n \nTotal gains (losses) included in Regulatory liabilities attributed to the change in unrealized gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities held at December 31\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n7\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nAmounts are reflected in Operating Revenues — Non-utility operations and Fuel, purchased power, gas, and other — non-utility in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n103\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following table presents the fair value reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for DTE Electric:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nNet Assets as of January 1\n$\n7\n \n$\n11\n \nTotal gains recorded in Regulatory liabilities\n21\n \n9\n \nPurchases, issuances, and settlements:\nSettlements\n(\n19\n)\n(\n13\n)\nNet Assets as of December 31\n$\n9\n \n$\n7\n \nTotal gains (losses) included in Regulatory liabilities attributed to the change in unrealized gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities held at December 31\n$\n9\n \n$\n7\n \nDerivatives are transferred between levels primarily due to changes in the source data used to construct price curves as a result of changes in market liquidity.

Certain basis prices (i.e., the difference in pricing between two locations) included in the valuation of natural gas and electricity contracts were deemed unobservable.  The weighted average price for unobservable inputs was calculated using the average of forward price curves for natural gas and electricity and the absolute value of monthly volumes.\nThe inputs listed above would have had a direct impact on the fair values of the above security types if they were adjusted.  A significant increase (decrease) in the basis price would have resulted in a higher (lower) fair value for long positions, with offsetting impacts to short positions.\n104\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe following table presents the carrying amount and fair value of financial instruments for DTE Energy:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCarrying\nFair Value\nCarrying\nFair Value\nAmount\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAmount\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\n(In millions)\nNotes receivable\n(a)\n, excluding lessor finance leases\n$\n884\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n904\n \n$\n175\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n181\n \nShort-term borrowings\n$\n1,067\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,067\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,283\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,283\n \n$\n—\n \nNotes payable\n(b)\n$\n37\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n34\n \nLong-term debt\n(c)\n$\n21,963\n \n$\n725\n \n$\n18,283\n \n$\n1,128\n \n$\n19,546\n \n$\n807\n \n$\n16,178\n \n$\n1,202\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nCurrent portion included in Current Assets — Other on DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The rabbi trust is comprised primarily of trading securities recorded at fair value, as well as debt securities classified as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost.  The trust was established to fund certain non-qualified pension benefits, and therefore changes in market value of the trading securities and interest on the held-to-maturity securities are recognized in earnings.  Gains and losses are allocated from DTE Energy to DTE Electric and are included in Other Income or Other Expense, respectively, in the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Gains (losses) related to the trading securities were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n106\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nNOTE 12 — \nFINANCIAL AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nThe Registrants recognize all derivatives at their fair value as Derivative assets or liabilities on their respective Consolidated Statements of Financial Position unless they qualify for certain scope exceptions, including the normal purchases and normal sales exception.  Further, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge); or as hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge).  For cash flow hedges, the derivative gain or loss is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs.  For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for the derivative and hedged item are recognized in earnings each period.  For derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period.\nThe Registrants' primary market risk exposure is associated with commodity prices, credit, and interest rates.  The Registrants have risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks.  The Registrants use derivative instruments to manage some of the exposure.  DTE Energy uses derivative instruments for trading purposes in its Energy Trading segment.  Contracts classified as derivative instruments include electricity, natural gas, oil, certain environmental contracts, forwards, futures, options, swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts.  Items not classified as derivatives include natural gas and environmental inventory, pipeline transportation contracts, some environmental contracts, and natural gas storage assets.\nDTE Electric\n — DTE Electric generates, purchases, distributes, and sells electricity.  DTE Electric uses forward contracts to manage changes in the price of electricity and fuel.  Substantially all of these contracts meet the normal purchases and normal sales exception and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.  Other derivative contracts are MTM and recoverable through the PSCR mechanism when settled.  This results in the deferral of unrealized gains and losses as Regulatory assets or liabilities until realized.\nDTE Gas \n— DTE Gas purchases, stores, transports, distributes, and sells natural gas, and buys and sells transportation and storage capacity.  DTE Gas has fixed-priced contracts for portions of its expected natural gas supply requirements through March 2027.  Substantially all of these contracts meet the normal purchases and normal sales exception and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.  Forward transportation and storage contracts are generally not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.\nDTE Vantage\n — DTE Vantage manages and operates renewable gas recovery projects, power generation assets, and other customer specific energy solutions.  Long-term contracts and hedging instruments are used in the marketing and management of the segment assets.  These contracts and hedging instruments are generally not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.\nEnergy Trading — Commodity Price Risk —\n Energy Trading markets and trades electricity, natural gas physical products, and energy financial instruments, and provides energy and asset management services utilizing energy commodity derivative instruments.  Forwards, futures, options, and swap agreements are used to manage exposure to the risk of market price and volume fluctuations in its operations.  These derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings unless hedge accounting criteria are met.\nEnergy Trading — Foreign Currency Exchange Risk —\n Energy Trading has foreign currency exchange forward contracts to economically hedge fixed Canadian dollar commitments existing under natural gas and power purchase and sale contracts and natural gas transportation contracts.  Energy Trading enters into these contracts to mitigate price volatility with respect to fluctuations of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.  These derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings unless hedge accounting criteria are met.\nCorporate and Other — Interest Rate Risk —\n DTE Energy may use interest rate swaps, treasury locks, and other derivatives to hedge the risk associated with interest rate market volatility.\nCredit Risk —\n DTE Energy maintains credit policies that significantly minimize overall credit risk.  These policies include an evaluation of potential customers’ and counterparties’ financial condition, including the viability of underlying productive assets, credit rating, collateral requirements, or other credit enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees.  DTE Energy generally uses standardized agreements that allow the netting of positive and negative transactions associated with a single counterparty.  DTE Energy maintains a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of its customers, historical trends, and other information.  Based on DTE Energy's credit policies and its December 31, 2024 provision for credit losses, DTE Energy’s exposure to counterparty nonperformance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on DTE Energy's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n107\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nDerivative Activities\nDTE Energy manages its MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract.  Accordingly, it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or natural gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year).  The following describes the categories of activities represented by their operating characteristics and key risks:\n•\nAsset Optimization\n — Represents derivative activity associated with assets owned and contracted by DTE Energy, including forward natural gas purchases and sales, natural gas transportation, and storage capacity.  Changes in the value of derivatives in this category typically economically offset changes in the value of underlying non-derivative positions, which do not qualify for fair value accounting.  The difference in accounting treatment of derivatives in this category and the underlying non-derivative positions can result in significant earnings volatility.\n•\nMarketing and Origination\n — Represents derivative activity transacted by originating substantially hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers, producers, end-users, utilities, retail aggregators, and alternative energy suppliers.\n•\nFundamentals Based Trading\n — Represents derivative activity transacted with the intent of taking a view, capturing market price changes, or putting capital at risk.  This activity is speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an existing exposure.\n•\nOther\n — Includes derivative activity at DTE Electric related to FTRs.  Changes in the value of derivative contracts at DTE Electric are recorded as Derivative assets or liabilities, with an offset to Regulatory assets or liabilities as the settlement value of these contracts will be included in the PSCR mechanism when realized.\nThe following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments for DTE Energy:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDerivative\nAssets\nDerivative\nLiabilities\nDerivative\nAssets\nDerivative\nLiabilities\n(In millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts\n$\n20\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\nForeign currency exchange contracts\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\nTotal derivatives designated as hedging instruments\n$\n20\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n18\n)\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nCommodity contracts\nNatural gas\n$\n428\n \n$\n(\n410\n)\n$\n637\n \n$\n(\n615\n)\nElectricity\n187\n \n(\n150\n)\n421\n \n(\n388\n)\nEnvironmental & Other\n58\n \n(\n44\n)\n139\n \n(\n150\n)\nForeign currency exchange contracts\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments\n$\n674\n \n$\n(\n604\n)\n$\n1,197\n \n$\n(\n1,154\n)\nCurrent\n$\n488\n \n$\n(\n441\n)\n$\n910\n \n$\n(\n847\n)\nNoncurrent\n206\n \n(\n164\n)\n287\n \n(\n325\n)\nTotal derivatives\n$\n694\n \n$\n(\n605\n)\n$\n1,197\n \n$\n(\n1,172\n)\nThe fair value of derivative instruments at DTE Electric was $\n9\n million and $\n7\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, comprised of FTRs recorded to Current Assets — Other on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and not designated as hedging instruments.\n108\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nCertain of DTE Energy's derivative positions are subject to netting arrangements which provide for offsetting of asset and liability positions as well as related cash collateral.  Such netting arrangements generally do not have restrictions.  Under such netting arrangements, DTE Energy offsets the fair value of derivative instruments with cash collateral received or paid for those contracts executed with the same counterparty, which reduces DTE Energy's Total Assets and Liabilities.  Cash collateral is allocated between the fair value of derivative instruments and customer accounts receivable and payable with the same counterparty on a pro-rata basis to the extent there is exposure.  Any cash collateral remaining, after the exposure is netted to zero, is reflected in Accounts receivable and Accounts payable as collateral paid or received, respectively.\nDTE Energy also provides and receives collateral in the form of letters of credit which can be offset against net Derivative assets and liabilities as well as Accounts receivable and payable.  DTE Energy had letters of credit of $\n1\n million issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024 and $\n3\n million at December 31, 2023, which could be used to offset net Derivative liabilities.  There were \nno\n letters of credit received from third parties which could be used to offset net Derivative assets at December 31, 2024 and there were $\n10\n million at December 31, 2023.  Such balances of letters of credit are excluded from the tables below and are not netted with the recognized assets and liabilities in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nFor contracts with certain clearing agents, the fair value of derivative instruments is netted against realized positions with the net balance reflected as either 1) a Derivative asset or liability or 2) an Account receivable or payable.  Other than certain clearing agents, Accounts receivable and Accounts payable that are subject to netting arrangements have not been offset against the fair value of Derivative assets and liabilities.\nThe following table presents net cash collateral offsetting arrangements for DTE Energy:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCash collateral netted against Derivative assets\n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n—\n \nCash collateral netted against Derivative liabilities\n—\n \n72\n \nCash collateral recorded in Accounts receivable\n(a)\n29\n \n57\n \nCash collateral recorded in Accounts payable\n(a)\n(\n5\n)\n(\n3\n)\nTotal net cash collateral posted (received)\n$\n7\n \n$\n126\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nAmounts are recorded net by counterparty.\n109\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following table presents the netting offsets of Derivative assets and liabilities for DTE Energy:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Amounts of Recognized Assets (Liabilities)\nGross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\nNet Amounts of Assets (Liabilities) Presented in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\nGross Amounts of Recognized Assets (Liabilities)\nGross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\nNet Amounts of Assets (Liabilities) Presented in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\n(In millions)\nDerivative assets\nCommodity contracts\n(a)\nNatural gas\n$\n428\n \n$\n(\n285\n)\n$\n143\n \n$\n637\n \n$\n(\n416\n)\n$\n221\n \nElectricity\n187\n \n(\n116\n)\n71\n \n421\n \n(\n243\n)\n178\n \nEnvironmental & Other\n58\n \n(\n46\n)\n12\n \n139\n \n(\n132\n)\n7\n \nInterest rate contracts\n20\n \n—\n \n20\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nForeign currency exchange contracts\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal derivative assets\n$\n694\n \n$\n(\n447\n)\n$\n247\n \n$\n1,197\n \n$\n(\n791\n)\n$\n406\n \nDerivative liabilities\nCommodity contracts\n(a)\nNatural gas\n$\n(\n410\n)\n$\n272\n \n$\n(\n138\n)\n$\n(\n615\n)\n$\n429\n \n$\n(\n186\n)\nElectricity\n(\n150\n)\n114\n \n(\n36\n)\n(\n388\n)\n297\n \n(\n91\n)\nEnvironmental & Other\n(\n44\n)\n44\n \n—\n \n(\n150\n)\n137\n \n(\n13\n)\nInterest rate contracts\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n16\n)\n—\n \n(\n16\n)\nForeign currency exchange contracts\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n(\n3\n)\nTotal derivative liabilities\n$\n(\n605\n)\n$\n430\n \n$\n(\n175\n)\n$\n(\n1,172\n)\n$\n863\n \n$\n(\n309\n)\n_______________________________________\n(a)\nFor contracts with a clearing agent, DTE Energy nets all activity across commodities.

Non-trading physical commodity sale and purchase derivative contracts are generally accounted for using the MTM method with unrealized and realized gains and losses for sales recorded in Operating Revenues — Non-utility operations and purchases recorded in Fuel, purchased power, gas, and other — non-utility.\nThe following represents the cumulative gross volume of DTE Energy's derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2024:\nCommodity\nNumber of Units\nNatural gas (MMBtu)\n2,061,711,943\n \nElectricity (MWh)\n39,109,082\n \nForeign currency exchange ($ CAD)\n74,608,748\n \nFTR (MWh)\n65,874\n \nRenewable Energy Certificates (MWh)\n10,569,260\n \nCarbon emissions (Metric Ton)\n210,079\n \nInterest rate contracts ($ USD)\n700,000,000\n \nVarious subsidiaries and equity investees of DTE Energy have entered into derivative and non-derivative contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by DTE Energy.  These contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that DTE Energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE Energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade.  Certain of these provisions (known as \"hard triggers\") state specific circumstances under which DTE Energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as \"soft triggers\") are not as specific.  For contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which DTE Energy may ultimately be required to post.  The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily natural gas, power, and environmental) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions.  As of December 31, 2024, DTE Energy's contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was $\n360\n million.\nAs of December 31, 2024, DTE Energy had $\n467\n million of derivatives in net liability positions, for which hard triggers exist.  There is \nno\n collateral that has been posted against such liabilities, including cash and letters of credit.  Associated derivative net asset positions for which contractual offset exists were $\n402\n million.  The net remaining amount of $\n65\n million is derived from the $\n360\n million noted above.\n111\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nNOTE 13 — \nLONG-TERM DEBT\nLong-Term Debt\nDTE Energy's long-term debt outstanding and interest rates of debt outstanding at December 31 were:\nInterest Rate\n(a)\nMaturity Date\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nMortgage bonds, notes, and other\nDTE Energy debt, unsecured\n4.2\n%\n2025 — 2034\n$\n6,380\n \n$\n5,105\n \nDTE Electric debt, principally secured\n3.9\n%\n2025 — 2053\n11,270\n \n10,370\n \nDTE Gas debt, principally secured\n4.3\n%\n2025 — 2054\n2,865\n \n2,545\n \n20,515\n \n18,020\n \nUnamortized debt discount\n(\n28\n)\n(\n26\n)\nUnamortized debt issuance costs\n(\n114\n)\n(\n100\n)\nLong-term debt due within one year\n(\n1,220\n)\n(\n2,075\n)\n$\n19,153\n \n$\n15,819\n \nSecuritization bonds\n(b)\nDTE Electric securitization bonds\n5.4\n%\n2027 — 2038\n$\n713\n \n$\n777\n \nUnamortized debt issuance costs\n(\n7\n)\n(\n8\n)\nLong-term debt due within one year\n(\n71\n)\n(\n64\n)\n$\n635\n \n$\n705\n \nJunior Subordinated Debentures\nSubordinated debentures\n4.8\n%\n2077 — 2081\n$\n910\n \n$\n910\n \nUnamortized debt issuance costs\n(\n26\n)\n(\n27\n)\n$\n884\n \n$\n883\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nWeighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2024.\n(b)\nBonds are held by DTE Securitization I and DTE Securitization II, special purpose entities consolidated by DTE Electric.

Should DTE Energy exercise this right, it cannot declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or acquire, any of its capital stock during the deferral period.  Any deferred interest payments will bear additional interest at the rate associated with the related debt issue.  As of December 31, 2024, no interest payments have been deferred on the Junior Subordinated Debentures.\nCross Default Provisions\nSubstantially all of the net utility properties of DTE Electric and DTE Gas are subject to the lien of mortgages.

Borrowings under the revolvers are available at prevailing short-term interest rates.  Letters of credit of up to $\n500\n million may also be issued under the DTE Energy revolver.  DTE Energy and DTE Electric also have other facilities to support letter of credit issuance and increase liquidity.\nThe unsecured revolving credit agreements require a total funded debt to capitalization ratio of no more than \n0.70\n to 1 for DTE Energy and \n0.65\n to 1 for DTE Electric and DTE Gas.  In the agreements, \"total funded debt\" means all indebtedness of each respective company and their consolidated subsidiaries, including finance lease obligations, hedge agreements, and guarantees of third parties’ debt, but excluding contingent obligations, nonrecourse and junior subordinated debt, and certain equity-linked securities and, except for calculations at the end of the second quarter, certain DTE Gas short-term debt.  \"Capitalization\" means the sum of (a) total funded debt plus (b) \"consolidated net worth,\" which is equal to consolidated total equity of each respective company and their consolidated subsidiaries (excluding pension effects under certain FASB statements), as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  At December 31, 2024, the total funded debt to total capitalization ratios for DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas were \n0.65\n to 1, \n0.52\n to 1, and \n0.49\n to 1, respectively, and were in compliance with this financial covenant.\n114\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe availability under the facilities in place at December 31, 2024 is shown in the following table:\nDTE Energy\nDTE Electric\nDTE Gas\nTotal\n(In millions)\nUnsecured revolving credit facility, expiring October 2029\n$\n1,500\n \n$\n800\n \n$\n300\n \n$\n2,600\n \nUnsecured letter of credit facility, expiring June 2025\n(a)\n175\n \n—\n \n—\n \n175\n \nUnsecured letter of credit facility, expiring February 2025\n150\n \n—\n \n—\n \n150\n \nUnsecured letter of credit facilities, expiring June 2026\n100\n \n—\n \n—\n \n100\n \nUnsecured letter of credit facility\n(b)\n50\n \n—\n \n—\n \n50\n \nUnsecured letter of credit facility\n(c)\n—\n \n125\n \n—\n \n125\n \n1,975\n \n925\n \n300\n \n3,200\n \nAmounts outstanding at December 31, 2024\nCommercial paper issuances\n392\n \n666\n \n9\n \n1,067\n \nLetters of credit\n117\n \n124\n \n—\n \n241\n \n509\n \n790\n \n9\n \n1,308\n \nNet availability at December 31, 2024\n$\n1,466\n \n$\n135\n \n$\n291\n \n$\n1,892\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nUncommitted letter of credit facility.\n(b)\nUncommitted letter of credit facility with automatic renewal provision and therefore no expiration.\n(c)\nUncommitted letter of credit facility with automatic renewal provision and therefore no expiration.

For information related to affiliate short-term borrowings, refer to Note 22 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Related Party Transactions.\"\nIn conjunction with maintaining certain exchange-traded risk management positions, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral with a clearing agent.  DTE Energy has a demand financing agreement with its clearing agent which allows the right of setoff with posted collateral.  At December 31, 2024, the capacity under the facility was $\n200\n million.  The amounts outstanding under demand financing agreements were $\n49\n million and $\n152\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were fully offset by posted collateral.\nDividend Restrictions\nCertain of DTE Energy’s credit facilities contain a provision requiring DTE Energy to maintain a total funded debt to capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, of no more than \n0.70\n to 1, which has the effect of limiting the amount of dividends DTE Energy can pay in order to maintain compliance with this provision.  At December 31, 2024, the effect of this provision was a restriction on dividend payments to no more than $\n2.5\n billion of DTE Energy's Retained earnings of $\n4.9\n billion.  There are \nno\n other effective limitations with respect to DTE Energy’s ability to pay dividends.\nNOTE 16 — \nLEASES\nLessee\nLeases at DTE Energy and DTE Electric are primarily comprised of various forms of certain easement leases, coal railcars, building equipment, and computer hardware, leases with terms ranging from approximately \n1\n to \n52\n years.  \nA lease is deemed to exist when the Registrants have the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment, as conveyed through a contract, for a certain period of time and consideration paid.  The right to control is deemed to occur when the Registrants have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the identified assets and the right to direct the use of such assets.\n115\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nLease liabilities are determined utilizing a discount rate to determine the present values of lease payments.  Topic 842 requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease when it is readily determinable.  When the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the incremental borrowing rate is used.  The Registrants have determined their respective incremental borrowing rates based upon the rate of interest that would have been paid on a collateralized basis over similar tenors to that of the leases.  The incremental borrowing rates for DTE Electric and DTE Gas have been determined utilizing respective secured borrowing rates for first mortgage bonds with like tenors of remaining lease terms.  Incremental borrowing rates for non-utility entities have been determined utilizing an implied secured borrowing rate based upon an unsecured rate for a similar tenor of remaining lease terms, which is then adjusted for the estimated impact of collateral.\nCertain leases of the Registrants contain escalation clauses whereby the payments are adjusted for consumer price or labor indices.  The Registrants have leases with non-index based escalation clauses for percentage increases.  DTE Energy also has leases with variable payments based upon usage of, or revenues associated with, the leased assets.  DTE Electric also has leases with variable payments based upon the usage of the leased assets.\nCertain leases of easements and coal railcars contain provisions whereby the Registrants have the option to terminate the lease agreement by giving notice of such termination during the time frames specified in the respective lease.  The Registrants have considered such provisions in the determination of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the lease would be terminated.\nThe Registrants have certain leases which contain purchase options.  Based upon the nature of the leased property and terms of the purchase options, the Registrants have determined it is not reasonably certain that such purchase options will be utilized.  Thus, the impact of the purchase options has not been included in the determination of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the subject leases.\nThe Registrants have certain leases which contain renewal options.  Where the renewal options were deemed reasonably certain to occur, the impacts of such options were included in the determination of the right of use assets and lease liabilities.\nThe Registrants have agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.  Consideration in a lease is allocated between lease and non-lease components based upon the estimated relative standalone prices.  The Registrants have certain coal railcar leases for which non-lease and lease components are accounted for as a single lease component, as permitted under Topic 842.\nThe following is a summary of the components of lease cost for the years ended December 31:\nDTE Energy\nDTE Electric\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nOperating lease cost\n$\n26\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n12\n \nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets\n4\n \n7\n \n7\n \n3\n \n6\n \n6\n \nInterest of lease liabilities\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal finance lease cost\n5\n \n7\n \n8\n \n4\n \n6\n \n6\n \nVariable lease cost\n17\n \n13\n \n9\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nShort-term lease cost\n18\n \n12\n \n19\n \n10\n \n4\n \n10\n \n$\n66\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n28\n \nThe Registrants have elected not to apply the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to leases with a term of 12 months or less.

Such leases are comprised of both fixed payments and variable payments which are contingent on volumes, with terms ranging from \n9\n to \n24\n years.  Generally, the operating leases do not have renewal provisions or options to purchase the assets at the end of the lease.  The operating leases generally do not have termination for convenience provisions.  Termination may be allowed under specific circumstances stated in the lease contract, such as under an event of default.\nCertain of the finance and operating leases have lease terms that extend to the end of the estimated economic life of the leased assets, thereby resulting in no residual value.  Any remaining residual values under the finance and operating leases are expected to be recovered through rates, renewals or new lease contracts.  Residual values have been determined using the estimated economic life of the leased assets.  The finance and operating leases do not contain residual value guarantees.\nCertain of the operating leases have both lease and non-lease components.  The lease and non-lease components are allocated based upon estimated relative standalone selling prices.\nA lease is deemed to exist when the Registrants have provided other parties with the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment, as conveyed through a contract, for a certain period of time and consideration received.  The right to control is deemed to occur when the Registrants have provided other parties with the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the identified assets and the right to direct the use of such assets.\nDTE Energy’s lease income associated with operating leases was included on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nFixed payments\n$\n15\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n15\n \nVariable payments\n45\n \n44\n \n67\n \n$\n60\n \n$\n59\n \n$\n82\n \nDTE Energy’s minimum future rental revenues under operating leases for remaining periods as of December 31, 2024 are as follows:\nDTE Energy\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n14\n \n2026\n11\n \n2027\n10\n \n2028\n6\n \n2029\n6\n \n2030 and thereafter\n29\n \n$\n76\n \nDepreciation expense associated with DTE Energy's property under operating leases was $\n9\n million, $\n8\n million, and $\n11\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe following is a summary of property under operating leases for DTE Energy as of December 31:\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nGross property under operating leases\n$\n227\n \n$\n228\n \nAccumulated amortization of property under operating leases\n$\n118\n \n$\n118\n \n118\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nNOTE 17 — \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental\nDTE Electric\nAir \n— DTE Electric is subject to the EPA ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of SO\n2\n and NO\nX\n.  The EPA and the state of Michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze, mercury, and other air pollution.  These rules have led to controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce SO\n2\n, NO\nX\n, mercury, and other emissions.  Additional rule making may occur over the next few years which could require additional controls for SO\n2\n, NO\nX\n, and other hazardous air pollutants.\nIn March 2024, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for fine particulate matter, particles of pollution with diameters generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller (PM2.5).  It is likely that areas of Michigan in which DTE Electric operates will be designated as non-attainment in the future and the state will be required to develop a SIP for such areas.  No impact is expected in the near term, and any long-term financial impacts cannot be assessed at this time.\nIn April 2024, the EPA finalized new rules to address emissions of GHGs from existing, new, modified, or reconstructed sources in the power sector.  The new rules may impact future electric generation plans that will be defined in DTE Electric's next Integrated Resource Plan filing.  Challenges to the rules have been filed, and DTE Electric will continue to monitor regulatory developments.  The financial impacts of the new rules are still being assessed.\nPending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on DTE Electric's operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers.  Potential impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the purchase of emission credits from market sources, higher costs of purchased power, and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical.  DTE Electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers, as authorized by the MPSC.\nTo comply with air pollution requirements, DTE Electric has spent approximately $\n2.4\n billion.  DTE Electric does \nno\nt anticipate additional capital expenditures for air pollution requirements, subject to the results of future rulemakings.\nWater\n — In response to EPA regulations and in accordance with the Clean Water Act section 316(b), DTE Electric was required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities.  A final rule became effective in October 2014, which required studies to be completed and submitted as part of the NPDES permit application process to determine the type of technology needed to reduce impacts to fish.  DTE Electric has completed the required studies and submitted reports for most of its generation plants, and a final study is in-process for Monroe power plant.  Final compliance for the installation of any required technology to reduce the impacts of water intake structures will be determined by the state on a case by case, site specific basis.\nAs part of the Monroe power plant NPDES permit, EGLE has added an option to evaluate the thermal discharge of the facility as it relates to Clean Water Act section 316(a) regulations in order to establish an appropriate temperature discharge limit.  DTE Electric has submitted to EGLE a biological demonstration study plan to evaluate the thermal discharge impacts to an aquatic community.  After approval of the plan by EGLE and completion of field sampling, data will be processed and compiled into a comprehensive report.  At the present time, DTE Electric cannot predict the outcome of this evaluation or financial impact.\n119\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nContaminated and Other Sites\n — Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke, or oil.  The facilities, which produced gas, have been designated as MGP sites.  DTE Electric conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites, including \nthree\n former MGP sites.  The investigations at the former MGP sites have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing.  Cleanup of one of the MGP sites is complete, and that site is closed.  DTE Electric has also completed partial closure of one additional site.  Cleanup activities associated with the remaining sites will continue over the next several years.  In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Electric is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including the area surrounding an ash landfill, electrical distribution substations, electric generating power plants, and underground and above ground storage tank locations.  The findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is expected to be incurred over the next several years.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, DTE Electric had $\n10\n million and $\n9\n million, respectively, accrued for remediation.  These costs are not discounted to their present value.  Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Electric’s financial position and cash flows.  DTE Electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site.\nCoal Combustion Residuals and Effluent Limitations Guidelines \n— A final EPA rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals, commonly known as coal ash, became effective in October 2015 and has continued to be updated in subsequent years.  The rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a non-hazardous waste and relies on various self-implementation design and performance standards.  DTE Electric currently owns and operates multiple coal ash storage facilities to manage coal ash from coal-fired power plants that are subject to federal, state, and local CCR and solid waste regulations.  At certain facilities, the rule required ongoing sampling and testing of monitoring wells, compliance with groundwater standards, and closure.\nOn May 8, 2024, the EPA finalized a new rule to regulate legacy CCR surface impoundments and CCR management units.  The rule expands the reach of the CCR rule to inactive electric generation sites and previously unregulated CCR at any active facility.  The rule also extends the dewatering and stabilization criteria of the closure in place performance standards to existing CCR landfills.  DTE Electric has no legacy CCR surface impoundments, but does have existing CCR landfills and is evaluating sites for CCR management units.  DTE Electric is in the process of evaluating the final rule, which may have significant financial impacts depending on the site-specific characteristics of the units that are regulated by the new rule.  Long-term financial impacts cannot be clearly defined at this time and likely will not be clearly defined until the regulated units are identified.  Challenges to the rule have been filed, and DTE Electric will continue to monitor for regulatory developments.  The preliminary cost estimate to comply with the revised rule is approximately $\n289\n million as of December 31, 2024, and is recorded to Asset retirement obligations.  The estimate will be updated as necessary when site-specific details are more fully known.  These costs are expected to be recoverable under the regulatory construct as part of removal costs.\nAt the state level, legislation was signed in December 2018 and provides for further regulation of the CCR program in Michigan.  Additionally, the statutory revision provides the basis of a CCR program that EGLE has submitted to the EPA for approval to fully regulate the CCR program in Michigan in lieu of a federal permit program.  The EPA is currently working with EGLE in reviewing the submitted state program, and DTE Electric will work with EGLE to implement the state program that may be approved in the future.\nThe EPA has updated and revised the ELG in 2015, 2020, and 2024.  In each revision, EPA has re-established technology-based standards applicable to wastewaters created at facilities with an electrical generating unit.  In each revision, the EPA also established new applicability dates.\nThe Reconsideration Rule, finalized in 2020, provided additional opportunities by finalizing a group of compliance subcategories that provided cessation of coal as a compliance option.  Additionally, the 2020 Reconsideration Rule established the Voluntary Incentives Program (VIP) for FGD wastewater compliance only.  If a facility applies for the VIP, they must meet more stringent standards, but are allowed an extended time period to meet the compliance requirements by December 1, 2028.  The Reconsideration Rule provided these new opportunities for DTE Electric to evaluate existing ELG compliance strategies and make any necessary adjustments to ensure full compliance with the ELGs in a cost-effective manner.\nCompliance schedules for individual facilities and individual waste streams are determined through issuance of new NPDES permits by the state of Michigan.  The state of Michigan issued an NPDES permit for the Belle River power plant establishing compliance deadlines based on the 2020 Reconsideration Rule.  On October 11, 2021, DTE Electric submitted a Notice of Planned Participation (NOPP) to the state of Michigan that formally announced the intent to pursue compliance subcategories as ELG compliance options: the cessation of coal at the Belle River power plant no later than December 31, 2028 and the VIP for FGD wastewater at Monroe power plant by December 31, 2028.\n120\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe EPA also finalized Supplemental ELG Rules on May 9, 2024.  This updated the regulations from the 2020 Reconsideration Rule for FGD wastewater, bottom ash transport water (BATW), combustion residual leachate (CRL), and legacy wastewater (LWW).  The supplemental rule established new technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards applicable to FGD wastewater, BATW, CRL, and LWW.  The applicability date for BATW is as soon as possible beginning July 8, 2024 and no later than December 31, 2029.  FGD wastewater retrofits must be completed as soon as possible, beginning July 8, 2024 and no later than December, 31 2029 or December 31, 2028 if a permittee is pursuing the VIP subcategory for FGD wastewater.  The Cessation of Coal compliance subcategory and VIP from the 2020 Reconsideration Rule were maintained in the 2024 Supplemental Rule and continue to be a fundamental component of DTE Electric's ELG compliance strategy.\nDTE Electric's compliance strategy includes the conversion of the two generating units at the Belle River power plant to a natural gas peaking resource in 2025-2026, which was included in the NOPP filed in 2021.  DTE Electric also submitted a new NOPP to apply for the cessation of coal compliance subcategory for generating units 3 and 4 at the Monroe power plant.  DTE Electric plans to retire Monroe's generating units 1 and 2 in 2032.\nDTE Electric continues to evaluate compliance strategies, technologies and system designs to achieve compliance with the EPA rules at the Monroe power plant in accordance with the VIP subcategory for FGD and new discharge requirements for BATW.  Additionally, DTE Electric is evaluating compliance strategies and options to address new requirement and deadlines for other wastewater streams in the 2024 Supplemental Rule at both Belle River Power Plant and Sibley Quarry.\nDTE Electric currently estimates the impact of the CCR and ELG rules to be $\n509\n million of capital expenditures through 2029.  This estimate may change in future periods as DTE Electric evaluates the CCR and ELG rules discussed above that have recently been finalized.\nDTE Gas\nContaminated and Other Sites \n— DTE Gas owns or previously owned \n14\n former MGP sites.  Investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each site.  Cleanup of \neight\n MGP sites is complete and those sites are closed.  DTE Gas has also completed partial closure of \nfour\n additional sites.  Cleanup activities associated with the remaining sites will continue over the next several years.  The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites.  In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Gas is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including gate stations, gas pipeline releases, and underground storage tank locations.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, DTE Gas had $\n26\n million accrued for remediation.  These costs are not discounted to their present value.  Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Gas' financial position and cash flows.  DTE Gas anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the MPSC, which allows for amortization of the MGP costs over a \nten-year\n period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs were incurred, will prevent the associated investigation and remediation costs from having a material adverse impact on DTE Gas' results of operations.\nAir \n— In March 2023, the EPA published the Good Neighbor Rule, which includes provisions for compressor engines operated for the transportation of natural gas.  In June 2024, the United States Supreme Court issued an opinion granting emergency applications to stay the Good Neighbor Rule.  The stay will remain in effect during other litigation.  The status of the rule remains uncertain as litigation is ongoing.  At this time, DTE Gas does not expect a significant financial impact.\nAs noted above for DTE Electric, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for fine particulate matter in March 2024.  It is likely that areas of Michigan in which DTE Gas operates will be designated as non-attainment in the future and the state will be required to develop a SIP for such areas.  No impact is expected in the near term, and any long-term financial impacts cannot be assessed at this time.\nNon-utility\nDTE Energy's non-utility businesses are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants.\n121\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nIn March 2019, the EPA issued an FOV to EES Coke Battery, LLC (\"EES Coke\"), the Michigan coke battery facility that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DTE Energy, alleging that the 2008 and 2014 permits issued by EGLE did not comply with the Clean Air Act.  In September 2020, the EPA issued another FOV alleging EES Coke's 2018 and 2019 SO2 emissions exceeded projections and hence violated non-attainment new source review permitting requirements.  EES Coke evaluated the EPA's alleged violations and believes that the permits approved by EGLE complied with the Clean Air Act.  EES Coke responded to the EPA's September 2020 allegations demonstrating its actual emissions are compliant with non-attainment new source review requirements.  On June 1, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint against EES Coke in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that EES Coke failed to comply with non-attainment new source review requirements under the Clean Air Act when it applied for the 2014 permit.  In November 2022, the Sierra Club and City of River Rouge were granted intervention.  On May 20, 2024, the court granted a motion allowing the DOJ to amend their complaint to add EES Coke's parent entities, including DTE Energy, as defendants.  The parent entities were added in an attempt to share in any potential liability; there are no additional claims alleged.  The case is proceeding through discovery and trial is set for July 2025.  At the present time, DTE Energy cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this matter.\nOther\nIn 2010, the EPA finalized a new one-hour SO\n2\n ambient air quality standard that requires states to submit plans and associated timelines for non-attainment areas that demonstrate attainment with the new SO\n2\n standard in phases.  Phase 1 addresses non-attainment areas designated based on ambient monitoring data.  Phase 2 addresses non-attainment areas with large sources of SO\n2\n and modeled concentrations exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for SO\n2\n.  Phase 3 addresses smaller sources of SO\n2\n with modeled or monitored exceedances of the new SO\n2\n standard.\nMichigan's Phase 1 non-attainment area included DTE Energy facilities.  However, the EPA published a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the area in June 2022 that did not impact any DTE Energy facilities.  It is also not expected that Phase 3 will have any impact on DTE Energy.\nMichigan's Phase 2 non-attainment area includes DTE Electric facilities in St. Clair County.  The EPA approved a clean data determination request submitted by EGLE.  This determination suspends certain planning requirements and sanctions for the non-attainment area for as long as the area continues to attain the 2010 SO2 air quality standards, but this does not automatically redesignate the area to attainment.  Until the area is officially redesignated as attainment, DTE Energy is unable to determine the impacts.\nREF Guarantees\nDTE Energy provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in or lease of its previously operated REF facilities.  The guarantees cover potential commercial, environmental, and tax-related obligations that will survive until \n90\n days after expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations.  DTE Energy estimates that its maximum potential liability under these guarantees at December 31, 2024 was $\n216\n million.  Payments under these guarantees are considered remote.\nOther Guarantees\nIn certain limited circumstances, the Registrants enter into contractual guarantees.  The Registrants may guarantee another entity’s obligation in the event it fails to perform and may provide guarantees in certain indemnification agreements.  The Registrants may also provide indirect guarantees for the indebtedness of others.  DTE Energy’s guarantees are not individually material with maximum potential payments totaling $\n69\n million at December 31, 2024.  Payments under these guarantees are considered remote.\nThe Registrants are periodically required to obtain performance surety bonds in support of obligations to various governmental entities and other companies in connection with its operations.  As of December 31, 2024, DTE Energy had $\n368\n million of performance bonds outstanding, including $\n193\n million for DTE Electric.  Performance bonds are not individually material, except for $\n130\n million of bonds supporting Energy Trading operations.  These bonds are meant to provide counterparties with additional assurance that Energy Trading will meet its contractual obligations for various commercial transactions.  The terms of the bonds align with those of the underlying Energy Trading contracts and are estimated to be outstanding approximately \n1\n to \n3\n years.  In the event that any performance bonds are called for nonperformance, the Registrants would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond.  The Registrants are released from the performance bonds as the contractual performance is completed and does not believe that a material amount of any currently outstanding performance bonds will be called.\n122\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nLabor Contracts\nThere are several bargaining units for DTE Energy subsidiaries' approximately \n4,800\n represented employees, including DTE Electric's approximately \n2,550\n represented employees.  This represents \n51\n% and \n59\n% of DTE Energy's and DTE Electric's total employees, respectively.  Of these represented employees, approximately \n8\n% have contracts expiring within one year for DTE Energy.  Less than \n1\n% of the represented employees have contracts expiring within one year for DTE Electric.\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Registrants were party to numerous long-term purchase commitments relating to a variety of goods and services required for their businesses.

The Registrants have made certain commitments in connection with the estimated 2025 annual capital expenditures.\nLudington Plant Contract Dispute\nDTE Electric and Consumers Energy Company (\"Consumers\"), joint owners of the Ludington Hydroelectric Pumped Storage plant (\"Ludington\"), entered into a 2010 engineering, procurement, and construction agreement with Toshiba International Corporation (\"TIC\"), under which TIC contracted to perform a major overhaul and upgrade of Ludington.  TIC later assigned the contract and all of its obligations to Toshiba America Energy Systems (\"TAES\").  TAES' work under the contract was incomplete, defective, and non-conforming.  DTE Electric and Consumers documented TAES' failures to perform under the contract and demanded that TAES provide a comprehensive plan to resolve those matters, including adherence to its warranty commitments and other contractual obligations.  DTE Electric and Consumers engaged in extensive efforts to resolve these issues with TAES, including a formal demand to TAES' parent, Toshiba Corporation, under a parent guaranty it provided.  TAES did not provide a comprehensive plan or otherwise met its performance obligations.  As a result of TAES' defaults, DTE Electric and Consumers terminated the contract.  In order to enforce their rights under the contract and parent guaranty, and to pursue appropriate damages, DTE Electric and Consumers filed a complaint against TAES and Toshiba Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in April 2022.\nIn June 2022, TAES and Toshiba Corporation filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, along with counterclaims seeking approximately $\n15\n million in damages related to payments allegedly owed under the parties' contract.  In September 2022, the motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.  DTE Electric believes the outstanding counterclaims are without merit, but would be liable for \n49\n% of the damages if approved.  In October 2022, the combined parties submitted a joint discovery plan to proceed with the litigation process and a potential trial during the second half of 2025.  DTE Electric cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.\n123\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nIn May 2023, the MPSC approved a jointly-filed request by DTE Electric and Consumers for authority to defer as a regulatory asset the costs associated with repairing or replacing the defective work performed by TAES while the litigation with TAES and Toshiba Corporation moves forward.  DTE Electric currently estimates its share of these repair and replacement costs ranges from $\n350\n million to $\n400\n million.  Such costs will be offset by any potential litigation proceeds received from TAES or Toshiba Corporation.  DTE Electric and Consumers will have the opportunity to seek recovery and ratemaking treatment for amounts which are not recovered from TAES or Toshiba Corporation.\nOther Contingencies\nThe Registrants are involved in certain other legal, regulatory, administrative, and environmental proceedings before various courts, arbitration panels, and governmental agencies concerning claims arising in the ordinary course of business.  These proceedings include certain contract disputes, additional environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and pending judicial matters.  The Registrants cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings.  The Registrants regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that they can estimate and are considered probable of loss.  The resolution of these pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods they are resolved.\nFor a discussion of contingencies related to regulatory matters and derivatives, see Notes 8 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Financial and Other Derivative Instruments,\" respectively.\nNOTE 18 — \nNUCLEAR OPERATIONS\nProperty Insurance\nDTE Electric maintains property insurance policies specifically for the Fermi 2 plant.  These policies cover such items as replacement power and property damage.  NEIL is the primary supplier of the insurance policies.\nDTE Electric maintains a policy for extra expenses, including replacement power costs necessitated by Fermi 2’s unavailability due to an insured event.  This policy has a 12-week waiting period and provides an aggregate $\n490\n million of coverage over a \nthree-year\n period.\nDTE Electric has $\n1.5\n billion in primary coverage and $\n1.25\n billion of excess coverage for stabilization, decontamination, debris removal, repair and/or replacement of property, and decommissioning.  The combined coverage limit for total property damage is $\n2.75\n billion.  The total limit for property damage for non-nuclear events is $\n1.8\n billion and an aggregate of $\n291\n million of coverage for extra expenses over a \ntwo-year\n period.\nOn December 20, 2019, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 was signed, extending TRIA through December 31, 2027.  For multiple terrorism losses caused by acts of terrorism not covered under the TRIA occurring within \none year\n after the first loss from terrorism, the NEIL policies would make available to all insured entities up to $\n3.2\n billion, plus any amounts recovered from reinsurance, government indemnity, or other sources to cover losses.\nUnder NEIL policies, DTE Electric could be liable for maximum assessments of up to $\n40\n million per event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear plant should exceed the accumulated funds available to NEIL.\nPublic Liability Insurance\nAs required by federal law, DTE Electric maintains $\n500\n million of public liability insurance for a nuclear incident.  Further, under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005, deferred premium charges up to $\n166\n million could be levied against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $\n25\n million per year per facility.  Thus, deferred premium charges could be levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the event of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities.\nNuclear Fuel Disposal Costs\nIn accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, DTE Electric has a contract with the DOE for the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2 that required DTE Electric to pay the DOE a fee of \n1\n mill per kWh of Fermi 2 electricity generated and sold.  The fee was a component of nuclear fuel expense.  The \n1\n mill per kWh DOE fee was reduced to \nzero\n effective May 16, 2014.\n124\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe DOE's Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository program for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel was terminated in 2011.  DTE Electric is a party in the litigation against the DOE for both past and future costs associated with the DOE's failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the timetable set forth in the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.  In July 2012, DTE Electric executed a settlement agreement with the federal government for costs associated with the DOE's delay in acceptance of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2 for permanent storage.  The settlement agreement, including extensions, has provided for a claims process and payment of delay-related costs experienced by DTE Electric through 2025.  DTE Electric's claims are being settled and paid on a timely basis.  The settlement proceeds reduce the cost of the dry cask storage facility assets and provide reimbursement for related operating expenses.\nDTE Electric currently employs a spent nuclear fuel storage strategy utilizing a fuel pool and a dry cask storage facility.  The spent nuclear fuel storage strategy is expected to provide sufficient spent fuel storage capability for the life of the plant as defined by DTE Electric's operating license agreement.\nThe federal government continues to maintain its legal obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2 for permanent storage.  Issues relating to long-term waste disposal policy and to the disposition of funds contributed by DTE Electric ratepayers to the federal waste fund await future governmental action.\nNOTE 19 — \nRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND TRUSTEED ASSETS\nDTE Energy's subsidiary, DTE Energy Corporate Services, LLC, sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans covering certain employees of the Registrants.

The plans are primarily sponsored by the LLC.  DTE Electric accounts for its participation in DTE Energy's qualified and non-qualified pension plans by applying multiemployer accounting.  DTE Electric accounts for its participation in other postretirement benefit plans by applying multiple-employer accounting.  Within multiemployer and multiple-employer plans, participants pool plan assets for investment purposes and to reduce the cost of plan administration.  The primary difference between plan types is that assets contributed in multiemployer plans can be used to provide benefits for all participating employers, while assets contributed within a multiple-employer plan are restricted for use by the contributing employer.\n125\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nAs a result of multiemployer accounting treatment, capitalized costs associated with these plans are reflected in Property, plant, and equipment in DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  The same capitalized costs are reflected as Regulatory assets and liabilities in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  For service costs recognized in earnings, these costs have historically been presented in Operation and maintenance in the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations.  For non-service costs recognized in earnings, these costs have historically been presented in Other (Income) and Deductions — Non-operating retirement benefits, net in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Operation and maintenance in the DTE Electric Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn November 2022, DTE Electric received a rate order from the MPSC approving the deferral of qualified pension plan service and non-service costs that were previously being recognized in earnings.  Therefore, the Registrants are recording these costs as Regulatory assets beginning in December 2022.\nPension Plan Benefits\nDTE Energy has qualified defined benefit retirement plans for eligible represented and non-represented employees.  The plans are noncontributory and provide traditional retirement benefits based on the employee's years of benefit service, average final compensation, and age at retirement.  In addition, certain represented and non-represented employees are covered under cash balance provisions that determine benefits on annual employer contributions and interest credits.  DTE Energy also maintains supplemental non-qualified, noncontributory, retirement benefit plans for certain management employees.  These plans provide for benefits that supplement those provided by DTE Energy’s other retirement plans.\nNet pension cost (credit) for DTE Energy includes the following components:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nService cost\n$\n58\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n95\n \nInterest cost\n208\n \n214\n \n166\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n341\n)\n(\n352\n)\n(\n346\n)\nAmortization of:\nNet actuarial loss\n59\n \n7\n \n115\n \nPrior service credit\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n1\n)\nSettlements\n—\n \n7\n \n94\n \nNet pension cost (credit)\n$\n(\n18\n)\n$\n(\n69\n)\n$\n123\n \n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Regulatory assets and Other comprehensive income (loss)\nNet actuarial (gain) loss\n$\n(\n49\n)\n$\n62\n \nAmortization of net actuarial loss and settlements\n(\n59\n)\n(\n14\n)\nAmortization of prior service credit\n2\n \n2\n \nTotal recognized in Regulatory assets and Other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n(\n106\n)\n$\n50\n \nTotal recognized in net periodic pension credit, Regulatory assets, and Other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n(\n124\n)\n$\n(\n19\n)\n126\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following table reconciles the obligations, assets, and funded status of the plans as well as the amounts recognized as a pension liability in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31:\nDTE Energy\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nAccumulated benefit obligation, end of year\n$\n3,803\n \n$\n4,089\n \nChange in projected benefit obligation\nProjected benefit obligation, beginning of year\n$\n4,318\n \n$\n4,309\n \nService cost\n58\n \n57\n \nInterest cost\n208\n \n214\n \nActuarial (gain) loss\n(\n254\n)\n74\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n348\n)\n(\n329\n)\nSettlements\n—\n \n(\n7\n)\nProjected benefit obligation, end of year\n$\n3,982\n \n$\n4,318\n \nChange in plan assets\nPlan assets at fair value, beginning of year\n$\n3,960\n \n$\n3,897\n \nActual return on plan assets\n137\n \n363\n \nCompany contributions\n9\n \n36\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n348\n)\n(\n329\n)\nSettlements\n—\n \n(\n7\n)\nPlan assets at fair value, end of year\n$\n3,758\n \n$\n3,960\n \nFunded status\n$\n(\n224\n)\n$\n(\n358\n)\nAmount recorded as:\nCurrent liabilities\n$\n(\n10\n)\n$\n(\n8\n)\nNoncurrent liabilities\n(\n214\n)\n(\n350\n)\n$\n(\n224\n)\n$\n(\n358\n)\nAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income, pre-tax\nNet actuarial loss\n$\n76\n \n$\n76\n \n$\n76\n \n$\n76\n \nAmounts recognized in Regulatory assets\n(a)\nNet actuarial loss\n$\n1,318\n \n$\n1,426\n \nPrior service credit\n(\n3\n)\n(\n5\n)\n$\n1,315\n \n$\n1,421\n \n______________________________________\n(a)\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\"\nThe decrease in the pension benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2024, was primarily due to an actuarial gain driven by an increase in discount rates.  The increase in DTE Energy's pension benefit obligation in 2023 was primarily due to an actuarial loss driven by a decrease in discount rates.\nThe Registrants’ policy is to fund pension costs by contributing amounts consistent with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and additional amounts when it deems appropriate.  In 2024, DTE Energy made a \nnominal\n contribution to the qualified pension plans.  In 2023 and 2022, DTE Gas transferred $\n50\n million of non-represented qualified pension plan funds to DTE Electric in exchange for cash consideration.  In addition, DTE Energy anticipates a transfer of up to $\n25\n million of non-represented qualified pension plan funds from DTE Gas to DTE Electric in 2025, subject to management discretion and any changes in financial market conditions.\nDTE Energy's subsidiaries are responsible for their share of qualified and non-qualified pension benefit costs.  DTE Electric's allocated portion of pension benefit costs included in regulatory assets and liabilities, operation and maintenance expense, other income and deductions, and capital expenditures were credits of $\n5\n million and $\n39\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a cost of $\n101\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022.  These amounts may include recognized contractual termination benefit charges, curtailment gains, and settlement charges.\n127\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nAt December 31, 2024, the benefits related to DTE Energy's qualified and non-qualified pension plans expected to be paid in each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter are as follows:\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n321\n \n2026\n321\n \n2027\n323\n \n2028\n325\n \n2029\n321\n \n2030-2034\n1,585\n \nTotal\n$\n3,196\n \nAssumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligation and net pension costs of DTE Energy are:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nProjected benefit obligation\nDiscount rate\n5.65\n%\n5.00\n%\n5.19\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.55\n%\n3.80\n%\n3.80\n%\nCash balance interest crediting rate\n4.50\n%\n3.60\n%\n3.40\n%\nNet pension costs\nDiscount rate\n5.00\n%\n5.19\n%\n2.91\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.80\n%\n3.80\n%\n3.80\n%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n8.00\n%\n7.60\n%\n6.80\n%\nCash balance interest crediting rate\n3.60\n%\n3.40\n%\n2.40\n%\nDTE Energy employs a formal process in determining the long-term rate of return for various asset classes.  Management reviews historic financial market risks and returns and long-term historic relationships between the asset classes of equities, fixed income, and other assets, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that asset classes with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-term.  Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates, asset class risks, and asset class returns are evaluated and considered before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.  The long-term portfolio return is also established employing a consistent formal process, with due consideration of diversification, active investment management, and rebalancing.  Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness.  As a result of this process, the Registrants have a long-term rate of return assumption for the pension plans of \n7.80\n% for 2025.  The Registrants believe this rate is a reasonable assumption for the long-term rate of return on plan assets given the current investment strategy.\nThe DTE Energy Company Affiliates Employee Benefit Plans Master Trust employs a liability driven investment program whereby the characteristics of plan liabilities are considered when determining investment policy.  Risk tolerance is established through consideration of future plan cash flows, plan funded status, and corporate financial considerations.  The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity, fixed income, and other investments.  Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks and large and small market capitalizations.  Fixed income investments generally include U.S. Treasuries, other governmental debt, diversified corporate bonds, bank loans, and mortgage-backed securities.  Other investments are used to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.  Derivatives may be utilized in a risk controlled manner, to potentially increase the portfolio beyond the market value of invested assets and/or reduce portfolio investment risk.  Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.\n128\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nTarget allocations for DTE Energy's pension plan assets as of December 31, 2024 are listed below:\nU.S. Large Capitalization (Cap) Equity Securities\n8\n \n%\nU.S. Small Cap and Mid Cap Equity Securities\n1\n \nNon-U.S. Equity Securities\n6\n \nFixed Income Securities\n58\n \nHedge Funds and Similar Investments\n8\n \nPrivate Equity and Other\n19\n \n100\n \n%\nThe following table provides the fair value measurement amounts for DTE Energy's pension plan assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023\n(a)\n:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nOther\n(b)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nOther\n(b)\nTotal\nDTE Energy asset category:\n(In millions)\nShort-term Investments\n(c)\n$\n97\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n97\n \n$\n100\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n100\n \nEquity Securities\nDomestic\n(d)\n—\n \n—\n \n349\n \n349\n \n—\n \n—\n \n550\n \n550\n \nInternational\n(e)\n35\n \n—\n \n188\n \n223\n \n55\n \n—\n \n309\n \n364\n \nFixed Income Securities\nGovernmental\n(f)\n627\n \n76\n \n—\n \n703\n \n531\n \n78\n \n—\n \n609\n \nCorporate\n(g)\n—\n \n1,350\n \n—\n \n1,350\n \n—\n \n1,323\n \n—\n \n1,323\n \nHedge Funds and Similar Investments\n(h)\n137\n \n14\n \n167\n \n318\n \n104\n \n68\n \n110\n \n282\n \nPrivate Equity and Other\n(i)\n—\n \n—\n \n718\n \n718\n \n—\n \n—\n \n732\n \n732\n \nDTE Energy Total\n$\n896\n \n$\n1,440\n \n$\n1,422\n \n$\n3,758\n \n$\n790\n \n$\n1,469\n \n$\n1,701\n \n$\n3,960\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nFor a description of levels within the fair value hierarchy, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value.\"\n(b)\nAmounts represent assets valued at NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.\n(c)\nThis category predominantly represents certain short-term fixed income securities and money market investments that are managed in separate accounts or commingled funds.

As a result of this process, the Registrants have a long-term rate of return assumption for the other postretirement benefit plans of \n7.50\n% for 2025.  The Registrants believe this rate is a reasonable assumption for the long-term rate of return on plan assets given the current investment strategy.\nThe DTE Energy Company Master VEBA Trust employs a liability driven investment program whereby the characteristics of plan liabilities are considered when determining investment policy.  Risk tolerance is established through consideration of future plan cash flows, plan funded status, and corporate financial considerations.  The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity, fixed income, and other investments.  Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks and large and small market capitalizations.  Fixed income investments generally include U.S. Treasuries, other governmental debt, diversified corporate bonds, bank loans, and mortgage-backed securities.  Other investments are used to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.  Derivatives may be utilized in a risk controlled manner to potentially increase the portfolio beyond the market value of invested assets and/or reduce portfolio investment risk.  Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.\nTarget allocations for the Registrants' other postretirement benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2024 are listed below:\nU.S. Large Cap Equity Securities\n4\n \n%\nNon-U.S. Equity Securities\n3\n \nFixed Income Securities\n63\n \nHedge Funds and Similar Investments\n9\n \nPrivate Equity and Other\n21\n \n100\n \n%\n133\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe following tables provide the fair value measurement amounts for the Registrants' other postretirement benefit plan assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023\n(a)\n:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nOther\n(b)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nOther\n(b)\nTotal\n(In millions)\nDTE Energy asset category:\nShort-term Investments\n(c)\n$\n33\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n33\n \n$\n41\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n41\n \nEquity Securities\nDomestic\n(d)\n—\n \n—\n \n67\n \n67\n \n—\n \n—\n \n76\n \n76\n \nInternational\n(e)\n6\n \n—\n \n34\n \n40\n \n7\n \n—\n \n43\n \n50\n \nFixed Income Securities\nGovernmental\n(f)\n210\n \n34\n \n—\n \n244\n \n242\n \n31\n \n—\n \n273\n \nCorporate\n(g)\n—\n \n492\n \n208\n \n700\n \n—\n \n459\n \n212\n \n671\n \nHedge Funds and Similar Investments\n(h)\n27\n \n3\n \n103\n \n133\n \n18\n \n21\n \n86\n \n125\n \nPrivate Equity and Other\n(i)\n—\n \n—\n \n377\n \n377\n \n—\n \n—\n \n378\n \n378\n \nDTE Energy Total\n$\n276\n \n$\n529\n \n$\n789\n \n$\n1,594\n \n$\n308\n \n$\n511\n \n$\n795\n \n$\n1,614\n \nDTE Electric asset category:\nShort-term Investments\n(c)\n$\n21\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n21\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n27\n \nEquity Securities\nDomestic\n(d)\n—\n \n—\n \n42\n \n42\n \n—\n \n—\n \n48\n \n48\n \nInternational\n(e)\n4\n \n—\n \n22\n \n26\n \n4\n \n—\n \n27\n \n31\n \nFixed Income Securities\nGovernmental\n(f)\n138\n \n22\n \n—\n \n160\n \n161\n \n21\n \n—\n \n182\n \nCorporate\n(g)\n—\n \n324\n \n141\n \n465\n \n—\n \n302\n \n145\n \n447\n \nHedge Funds and Similar Investments\n(h)\n17\n \n2\n \n69\n \n88\n \n11\n \n14\n \n58\n \n83\n \nPrivate Equity and Other\n(i)\n—\n \n—\n \n250\n \n250\n \n—\n \n—\n \n252\n \n252\n \nDTE Electric Total\n$\n180\n \n$\n348\n \n$\n524\n \n$\n1,052\n \n$\n203\n \n$\n337\n \n$\n530\n \n$\n1,070\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nFor a description of levels within the fair value hierarchy see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value.\"\n(b)\nAmounts represent assets valued at NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.\n(c)\nThis category predominantly represents certain short-term fixed income securities and money market investments that are managed in separate accounts or commingled funds.

Exchange-traded debt and equity securities held directly, as well as publicly traded commingled funds, are valued using quoted market prices in actively traded markets.  Non-publicly traded commingled funds hold exchange-traded equity or debt securities and are valued based on NAVs.  Non-exchange traded fixed income securities are valued by the trustee based upon quotations available from brokers or pricing services.  A primary price source is identified by asset type, class, or issue for each security.  The trustee monitors prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the trustee challenges an assigned price and determines that another price source is considered preferable.  The Registrants have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Registrants also sponsor defined contribution retirement savings plans.  Participation in one of these plans is available to substantially all represented and non-represented employees.  For substantially all employees, the Registrants match employee contributions up to certain predefined limits based upon eligible compensation and the employee’s contribution rate.  Additionally, for eligible represented and non-represented employees who do not participate in the Pension Plans, the Registrants contribute amounts equivalent to \n4\n% (\n8\n% for certain DTE Gas represented employees) of an employee's eligible compensation to the employee's defined contribution retirement savings plan.  For DTE Energy, the cost of these plans was $\n76\n million, $\n75\n million, and $\n73\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  For DTE Electric, the cost of these plans was $\n35\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nNOTE 20 — \nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nDTE Energy’s stock incentive program permits the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualifying stock options, stock awards, performance shares, and performance units to employees and members of its Board of Directors.  As a result of a stock award, a settlement of an award of performance shares, or by exercise of a participant’s stock option, DTE Energy may deliver common stock from its authorized but unissued common stock and/or from outstanding common stock acquired by or on behalf of DTE Energy in the name of the participant.  Key provisions of the stock incentive program are:\n•\nAuthorized limit is \n20,162,716\n shares of common stock;\n•\nProhibits the grant of a stock option with an exercise price that is less than the fair market value of DTE Energy’s stock on the date of the grant; and\n•\nImposes the following award limits to a single participant in a single calendar year, (1) options for more than \n500,000\n shares of common stock; (2) stock awards for more than \n150,000\n shares of common stock; (3) performance share awards for more than \n300,000\n shares of common stock (based on the maximum payout under the award); or (4) more than \n1,000,000\n performance units, which have a face amount of $\n1.00\n each.\nDTE Energy records compensation expense at fair value over the vesting period for all awards it grants.\nThe following table summarizes the components of stock-based compensation for DTE Energy:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nStock-based compensation expense\n$\n54\n \n$\n48\n \n$\n62\n \nTax benefit\n$\n10\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n11\n \nRestricted Stock Awards\nStock awards granted under the plan are restricted for varying periods, generally for \nthree years\n.  Participants have all rights of a shareholder with respect to a stock award, including the right to receive dividends and vote the shares.  Prior to vesting in stock awards, the participant: (i) may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, or otherwise dispose of shares; (ii) shall not retain custody of the share certificates; and (iii) will deliver to DTE Energy a stock power with respect to each stock award upon request.\n135\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nThe stock awards are recorded at cost that approximates fair value on the date of grant.  The cost is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period.\nThe fair value of awards vested were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.  Compensation cost charged against income was $\n14\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and $\n15\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022. \nPerformance Share Awards\nPerformance shares awarded under the plan are for a specified number of shares of DTE Energy common stock that entitle the holder to receive a cash payment, shares of DTE Energy common stock, or a combination thereof.  The final value of the award is determined by the achievement of certain performance objectives and market conditions.  The awards vest at the end of a specified period, usually \nthree years\n.  Awards granted in 2024, 2023, and 2022 were primarily deemed to be equity awards.  The DTE Energy stock price and number of probable shares attributable to market conditions for such equity awards are fair valued only at the grant date.  DTE Energy accounts for performance share awards by accruing compensation expense over the vesting period based on: (i) the number of shares expected to be paid which is based on the probable achievement of performance objectives; and (ii) the closing stock price market value.  The settlement of the award is based on the closing price at the settlement date.\nDTE Energy recorded activity relating to performance share awards as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nWeighted average grant date fair value of awards granted (per share)\n$\n106.04\n \n$\n112.73\n \n$\n120.25\n \nAwards settled in cash\n(a)\n$\n—\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n10\n \nAwards settled in stock\n(a)\n$\n63\n \n$\n59\n \n$\n72\n \nCompensation expense\n$\n40\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n47\n \n_______________________________________\n(a)\nSum of awards settled in cash and stock approximates the intrinsic value of the awards.\nDuring the vesting period, the recipient of a performance share award has no shareholder rights.  During the period beginning on the date the performance shares are awarded and ending on the certification date of the performance objectives, the number of performance shares awarded will be increased, assuming full dividend reinvestment at the fair market value on the dividend payment date.  The cumulative number of performance shares will be adjusted to determine the final payment based on the performance objectives achieved.  Performance share awards are nontransferable and are subject to risk of forfeiture.\nThe following table summarizes DTE Energy’s performance share activity for the period ended December 31, 2024:\nPerformance Shares\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n990,493\n \n$\n121.29\n \nGrants\n406,442\n \n$\n106.04\n \nForfeitures\n(\n89,966\n)\n$\n109.69\n \nPayouts\n(\n330,126\n)\n$\n102.83\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n976,843\n \n$\n122.25\n \n136\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nUnrecognized Compensation Costs\nAs of December 31, 2024, DTE Energy's total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock incentive plan arrangements and the weighted average recognition period was as follows:\nUnrecognized\nCompensation\nCost\nWeighted Average\nto be Recognized\n(In millions)\n(In years)\nStock awards\n$\n20\n \n1.95\nPerformance shares\n36\n \n1.71\n$\n56\n \n1.80\nAllocated Stock-Based Compensation\nDTE Electric received an allocation of costs from DTE Energy associated with stock-based compensation.
