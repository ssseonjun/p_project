We face terrestrial broadband Internet (defined by the FCC as at least 100 Mbps) competition from AT&T, Frontier Communications Corporation (“Frontier”) and Verizon are our primary FTTH competitors .\n Our residential video service faces growing competition across our footprint from a number of other sources, including companies that deliver linear network programming, movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices . These competitors include virtual MVPDs such as YouTube TV, Hulu Live, Sling TV, Philo and DirecTV Stream .\n Our mobile service faces competition from national mobile network operators including AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, as well as regional operators and mobile virtual network operators . DBS service providers offer satellite-delivered pre-packaged programming services that can be received by relatively small and inexpensive receiving dishes . We also compete with wireline video services in significant portions of our operating areas .\n The increase in the number of different technologies capable of carrying voice services has intensified the competitive environment in which we operate our residential voice service . Other regional competitors have built networks that offer Internet, video, mobile and voice services that compete with our services . Advertising competition has increased and will likely continue to increase as new advertising platforms seek to attract the same advertisers .\n Charter, Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”), Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time) Our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation service areas . Our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels .\n Liberty Broadband will merge with and into Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC (the “upstream merger” and together with the merger, the “combination” The merger will be the \"effective time” at the effective time of the merger (the effective time’s effective time) immediately following the merger .\n As of December 31, 2024, Liberty Broadband’s principal assets consist of approximately 45.3 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and its subsidiary GCI, LLC . The companies expect the transaction to close on June 30, 2027, subject to the completion of the spin-off and other customary closing conditions .\n Cable systems and related communications networks and services are extensively regulated by the federal government (primarily the FCC), certain state governments and many local governments . Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial penalties . Internet-delivered streaming video services compete with our traditional video service, but they are not subject to the same level of federal, state, and local regulation .\n Federal law requires cable companies to provide cable systems with access to poles . Federal law does not extend to poles owned by electric companies, but states are free to regulate them . The FCC's approach does not directly affect the rate in the twenty-three states that self-regulate, but many of those states have substantially the same rate .\n Communications Act and FCC regulations cover a variety of additional areas applicable to our video services . These include licensing of systems and facilities, including the grant of various spectrum licenses; (2) equal employment opportunity obligations; (3) customer service standards, (4) technical standards; (5) mandatory blackouts of certain network and syndicated programming; (6) restrictions on political advertising; (7) restrictions . (8) ownership restrictions; (9) posting of certain information on an FCC “public file” website; (10) emergency alert systems; (11) inside wiring and contracts for MDU complexes .\n Our ability to access and use spectrum that may become available in the future is uncertain and may be limited by further FCC auction or allocation decisions .

The carriage of television and radio broadcast signals by cable systems are subject to a federal compulsory copyright license .\n The specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary significantly between jurisdictions . Federal law imposes a cap on franchise fees of 5% of gross revenues from the provision of cable services over the cable system .

In 2024, the FCC once again reclassified our Internet access services as telecommunications services . The industry challenged the Order in court, and on January 2, 2025, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a decision invalidating the reclassification .\n FCC decision reclassifying Internet access services also ruled that state regulators may not impose obligations similar to federal network neutrality obligations . Several states have adopted rules similar to the network neutrality requirements that were eliminated by the FCC . California has also adopted other regulations, including network resiliency rules to assure backup power is available after natural disasters and other outages .\n In November 2023, the FCC adopted new rules governing digital discrimination, pursuant to The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 . These rules have been challenged in federal court, and we cannot predict the outcome of those challenges . The application of these rules could adversely affect our business. for consumers to terminate subscription services, including all our services.\n Spectrum Mobile offers mobile Internet access and telephone service . We provide this service as a mobile virtual network operator (“MVNO”) using Verizon’s network and our network through Spectrum WiFi . As an MVNO, we are subject to many of the same FCC regulations that apply to facilities-based wireless carriers .\n Spectrum Mobile: FCC has never classified the VoIP wireline telephone services we offer as “telecommunications services” that are subject to traditional federal common carrier regulation . The FCC has imposed some of these regulatory requirements on a case-by-case basis, such as requirements relating to 911 emergency services (“E911”), CALEA (the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communications) and Universal Service Fund contributions .\n Some states have attempted to subject cable VoIP services, such as our VoIP telephone service, to state level regulation . It is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved . The Communications Act limits our ability to collect, use, and disclose customers’ personally identifiable information for our Internet, video, mobile and voice services .\n The FCC, FTC, and many states regulate and restrict the marketing practices of communications service providers, including telemarketing and sending unsolicited commercial emails . The FTC has the authority, pursuant to its general authority to enforce against unfair or deceptive acts and practices, to protect the privacy of Internet service customers, including our use and disclosure of certain customer information .\n Many states have enacted comprehensive consumer data privacy laws . Some states have issue-specific privacy laws covering health information and children's information . Data privacy laws have taken effect in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, and Utah . Other state legislatures are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation .\n The FTC has an ongoing Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to explore rules related to the collection, analysis, and monetization of consumers' information . The new Congress may also adopt new privacy and data security obligations that could supplement or preempt state privacy laws . We cannot predict whether any of the above efforts will be successful, challenged, upheld, vacated, or preempted .\n All hourly employees have a starting minimum wage of at least $20 per hour, which is well above any state or federal minimum wage level . We provide competitive financial benefits to all employees such as a 401(k) Plan with a dollar-for-dollar company match up to 6% of their eligible pay . The substantial skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees and our training of our customer-faci .\n We offer thousands of learning experiences spanning leadership development, new hire, and professional skills training both online and in the classroom . We offer a tuition-free degree and certificate program, removing the financial barrier for employees to continue their education through convenient online learning . We conduct annual talent planning to review the overall performance of our leaders and their potential to serve in larger, more complex roles .\n Business Resource Groups (BRGs) focus on people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, employees with multicultural backgrounds, veterans and women . These voluntary groups enable employees to engage in activities that support our culture of inclusion .
