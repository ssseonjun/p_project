M&T’s wholly-owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust, N.A. Those bank subsidiaries offer a wide range of retail and commercial banking, trust and wealth management, and institutional services to their customers.\nM&T Bank, with total consolidated assets of $207.6 billion at December 31, 2024, is a New York-chartered commercial bank with 955 domestic banking offices primarily located in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., including the District of Columbia, and a full-service commercial banking office in Ontario, Canada. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in their markets.\nWilmington Trust, N.A. is a national bank with total consolidated assets of $711 million at December 31, 2024. Wilmington Trust, N.A. and its subsidiaries offer various trust and wealth management services. Further information about the Company's business, its legal entity structure and its significant subsidiaries is included in Part I, Item 1, \"Business\" and Exhibit 21.1 of this Form 10-K.\nOn April 1, 2022, M&T completed the acquisition of People’s United. Through subsidiaries, People's United provided commercial banking, retail banking and wealth management services to individual, corporate and municipal customers through a network of branches located in Connecticut, southeastern New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Following the merger, People's United Bank, National Association, a national banking association and a wholly owned subsidiary of People's United, merged with and into M&T Bank with M&T Bank as the surviving entity. The People's United transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. M&T recorded assets acquired of $64.2 billion, including $35.8 billion of loans and leases and $11.6 billion of investment securities, and liabilities assumed totaling $55.5 billion, including $53.0 billion of deposits. The transaction added $8.4 billion to M&T's common shareholders' equity and $261 million to preferred equity. In connection with the acquisition the Company recorded $3.9 billion of goodwill and $261 million of core deposit and other intangible assets. The results of operations acquired from People's United have been included in the Company's financial results since April 1, 2022. Information regarding the Company's acquisition and divestitures is included in note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements. \nFinancial Overview\nFor a discussion of 2023 results as compared with 2022 results, see Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe results of the Company’s operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2023 reflect lower net interest income as higher deposit and borrowing costs outpaced increased yields received on earning assets. The FOMC had increased its federal funds target rate through multiple hikes totaling 5.25% from March 2022 through July 2023 in response to inflationary pressures, before lowering that rate a total of 1.00% from September 2024 through December 2024. The amount of commercial real estate loans designated as \"criticized\" at December 31, 2024 improved from a year earlier and contributed to a modest decline in provision for \n52\ncredit losses in 2024 as compared with 2023. In the second quarter of 2023, M&T completed the divestiture of its CIT business to a private equity firm. The sale of that business resulted in a pre-tax gain of $225 million ($157 million after-tax effect) in the 2023 results of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule on special assessment pursuant to systemic risk determination resulting from the closures of certain failed banks earlier in that year. As a result, the Company recorded an expense of $197 million ($146 million after-tax effect) and $34 million ($26 million after-tax effect) for the special assessment in the 2023 and 2024 results of operations, respectively. A comparative summary of financial results for the Company is provided in Table 1.\nTable 1\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\nChange from\n2023 to 2024\n2022 to 2023\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount\n% \nAmount \n% \nNet interest income\n$\n6,852 \n$\n7,115 \n$\n5,822 \n$\n(263)\n-4 \n%\n$\n1,293 \n22 \n%\nTaxable-equivalent adjustment (a)\n50 \n54 \n39 \n(4)\n-9 \n15 \n40 \nNet interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) (a)\n6,902 \n7,169 \n5,861 \n(267)\n-4 \n1,308 \n22 \nProvision for credit losses\n610 \n645 \n517 \n(35)\n-5 \n128 \n25 \nOther income\n2,427 \n2,528 \n2,357 \n(101)\n-4 \n171 \n7 \nOther expense\n5,359 \n5,379 \n5,050 \n(20)\n— \n329 \n7 \nNet income\n2,588 \n2,741 \n1,992 \n(153)\n-6 \n749 \n38 \nPer common share data:\nBasic earnings\n14.71 \n15.85 \n11.59 \n(1.14)\n-7 \n4.26 \n37 \nDiluted earnings\n14.64 \n15.79 \n11.53 \n(1.15)\n-7 \n4.26 \n37 \nPerformance ratios\nReturn on:\nAverage assets\n1.23 \n%\n1.33 \n%\n1.05 \n%\nAverage common shareholders' equity\n9.54 \n11.06 \n8.67 \nNet interest margin\n3.58 \n3.83 \n3.39 \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nNet interest income data are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis which is a non-GAAP measure. The taxable-equivalent adjustment represents additional income taxes that would be due if all interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment, which is related to interest received on qualified municipal securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of approximately 25% in 2024 and 26% in each of 2023 and 2022.\nThe decrease in net income in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflects the following:\n•\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $6.90 billion in 2024, a decline of $267 million, or 4% from $7.17 billion in 2023. That decrease reflects a 25 basis-point (hundredth of one percent) narrowing of the net interest margin to 3.58% in 2024 from 3.83% in 2023 as increases in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities outpaced a rise in the yield received on earning assets.\n•\nThe provision for credit losses was $610 million in 2024, compared with $645 million in 2023, reflecting improved performance of loans to commercial real estate borrowers, partially offset by commercial and industrial and consumer loan growth. \n•\nNoninterest income declined $101 million, or 4%, to $2.43 billion in 2024 as compared with $2.53 billion in 2023, reflecting the sale of the CIT business in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher service charges on deposit accounts, non-CIT business related trust income, mortgage banking revenues, brokerage services income and distributions from M&T's investment in BLG.\n53\n•\nNoninterest expense aggregated $5.36 billion in 2024, compared with $5.38 billion in 2023. The $20 million decrease in noninterest expense reflected FDIC special assessments of $197 million in 2023 and $34 million in 2024, lower professional and other services expense, reflecting lower sub-advisory fees resulting from the sale of the CIT business in April 2023, and a decline in management consulting fees. Those deceases were partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits expense, reflecting annual merit and other increases and a rise in incentive compensation, and higher outside data processing and software costs.\n•\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 21.8% in 2024, compared with 24.3% in 2023. The 2024 income tax expense reflects a $14 million discrete tax benefit related to certain tax credits claimed on a prior year income tax return and a $17 million net discrete tax benefit related to the resolution of an income tax matter inherited from the acquisition of People's United.\nOn May 13, 2024, M&T issued 75,000 shares of Perpetual Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series J, with a liquidation preference of $10,000 per share. On August 15, 2024, M&T redeemed all 350,000 outstanding shares of its Perpetual Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E, for $350 million. Additional information about the issued and outstanding preferred stock of M&T is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nUnder approved capital plans and programs authorized by the Board of Directors, M&T repurchased 2,148,042 shares of its common stock in 2024 at an average cost per share of $184.37 resulting in a total cost, including the share repurchase excise tax, of $400 million. In 2023, M&T repurchased 3,838,157 shares of its common stock at an average cost per share of $154.76 resulting in a total cost, including the share repurchase excise tax, of $600 million. On January 22, 2025, M&T's Board of Directors authorized a program under which $4.0 billion of common shares may be repurchased. That authorization replaced and terminated the previous authorized share repurchase program effective as of the same date. \n54\nSupplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations\nM&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a \"net operating\" or \"tangible\" basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and gains (when realized) and expenses (when incurred) associated with merging acquired or to be acquired operations with and into the Company, since such items are considered by management to be \"nonoperating\" in nature. In 2022, those merger-related expenses totaled $580 million ($432 million after-tax effect). There were no merger-related expenses in 2024 and 2023. Although \"net operating income\" as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T’s management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. The following table represents a comparative summary of certain non-GAAP results of operations.\nTable 2\nSUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING OF NON-GAAP RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, \nPercentage Change From\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2023 to 2024\n2022 to 2023\nNet operating income\n$\n2,630 \n$\n2,789 \n$\n2,466 \n-6 \n%\n13 \n%\nDiluted net operating earnings per share\n14.88 \n16.08 \n14.42 \n-7 \n12 \nReturn on:\nAverage tangible assets\n1.30 \n%\n1.42 \n%\n1.35 \n%\nAverage tangible common equity\n14.54 \n17.60 \n16.70 \nEfficiency ratio\n56.9 \n54.9 \n56.6 \nTangible equity per common share (a)\n$\n109.36 \n$\n98.54 \n$\n86.59 \n11 \n14 \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nAt the period end.\nThe efficiency ratio measures the relationship of noninterest operating expenses, which exclude expenses M&T considers to be \"nonoperating\" in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, to revenues. The calculations of the Company’s efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), and reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are presented in Table 3.\n55\nTable 3\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome statement data\nNet income\nNet income\n$\n2,588 \n$\n2,741 \n$\n1,992 \nAmortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (a)\n42 \n48 \n43 \nMerger-related expenses (a)\n— \n— \n431 \nNet operating income\n$\n2,630 \n$\n2,789 \n$\n2,466 \nEarnings per common share\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n14.64 \n$\n15.79 \n$\n11.53 \nAmortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (a)\n.24 \n.29 \n.26 \nMerger-related expenses (a)\n— \n— \n2.63 \nDiluted net operating earnings per common share\n$\n14.88 \n$\n16.08 \n$\n14.42 \nOther expense\nOther expense\n$\n5,359 \n$\n5,379 \n$\n5,050 \nAmortization of core deposit and other intangible assets\n(53)\n(62)\n(56)\nMerger-related expenses\n— \n— \n(338)\nNoninterest operating expense\n$\n5,306 \n$\n5,317 \n$\n4,656 \nMerger-related expenses\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n102 \nEquipment and net occupancy\n— \n— \n7 \nOutside data processing and software\n— \n— \n5 \nProfessional and other services\n— \n— \n72 \nAdvertising and marketing\n— \n— \n9 \nOther costs of operations\n— \n— \n143 \nOther expense\n— \n— \n338 \nProvision for credit losses\n— \n— \n242 \nTotal\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n580 \nEfficiency ratio\nNoninterest operating expense (numerator)\n$\n5,306 \n$\n5,317 \n$\n4,656 \nTaxable-equivalent net interest income\n$\n6,902 \n$\n7,169 \n$\n5,861 \nOther income\n2,427 \n2,528 \n2,357 \nLess: Gain (loss) on bank investment securities\n10 \n4 \n(6)\nDenominator\n$\n9,319 \n$\n9,693 \n$\n8,224 \nEfficiency ratio\n56.9 \n%\n54.9 \n%\n56.6 \n%\nBalance sheet data\nAverage assets\nAverage assets\n$\n211,220 \n$\n205,397 \n$\n190,252 \nGoodwill\n(8,465)\n(8,473)\n(7,537)\nCore deposit and other intangible assets\n(120)\n(177)\n(179)\nDeferred taxes\n33 \n44 \n43 \nAverage tangible assets\n$\n202,668 \n$\n196,791 \n$\n182,579 \nAverage common equity\nAverage total equity\n$\n28,052 \n$\n25,899 \n$\n23,810 \nPreferred stock\n(2,344)\n(2,011)\n(1,946)\nAverage common equity\n25,708 \n23,888 \n21,864 \nGoodwill\n(8,465)\n(8,473)\n(7,537)\nCore deposit and other intangible assets\n(120)\n(177)\n(179)\nDeferred taxes\n33 \n44 \n43 \nAverage tangible common equity\n$\n17,156 \n$\n15,282 \n$\n14,191 \nAt end of year\nTotal assets\nTotal assets\n$\n208,105 \n$\n208,264 \n$\n200,730 \nGoodwill\n(8,465)\n(8,465)\n(8,490)\nCore deposit and other intangible assets\n(94)\n(147)\n(209)\nDeferred taxes\n28 \n37 \n51 \nTotal tangible assets\n$\n199,574 \n$\n199,689 \n$\n192,082 \nTotal common equity\nTotal equity\n$\n29,027 \n$\n26,957 \n$\n25,318 \nPreferred stock\n(2,394)\n(2,011)\n(2,011)\nCommon equity\n26,633 \n24,946 \n23,307 \nGoodwill\n(8,465)\n(8,465)\n(8,490)\nCore deposit and other intangible assets\n(94)\n(147)\n(209)\nDeferred taxes\n28 \n37 \n51 \nTotal tangible common equity\n$\n18,102 \n$\n16,371 \n$\n14,659 \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nAfter any related tax effect.\n56\nTaxable-equivalent Net Interest Income\nInterest income earned on certain of the Company's assets is exempt from federal income tax. Taxable-equivalent net interest income is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts income earned on a tax-exempt asset to present it on an equivalent basis to interest income earned on a fully taxable asset.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $6.90 billion in 2024, compared with $7.17 billion in 2023. That decrease reflects a 25 basis-point narrowing of the net interest margin to 3.58% in 2024 from 3.83% in 2023 as higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities outpaced an increase in yields on earnings assets. The FOMC raised its federal funds target interest rate through multiple hikes that totaled 5.25% from March 2022 through July 2023 in response to inflationary pressures, before reducing that rate by a total of 1.00% in the last four months of 2024. During the recent year, the Company continued to adjust its funding sources in consideration of the changing interest rate environment as well as the competitive landscape for customer deposits. An increase in average interest-bearing liabilities in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflected a shift in customer deposits toward higher cost interest-bearing products and higher average levels of borrowings. Average interest-bearing deposits rose $9.5 billion, or 9%, and average borrowings rose $2.5 billion, or 19%, in 2024 as compared with 2023. The rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 57 basis points over the same period. The increase in average earning assets in 2024 reflects higher average interest-bearing deposits at the FRB of New York, purchases of investment securities and loan growth. The yield received on earning assets in 2024 increased by 24 basis points from 2023. The Company's average balance sheets accompanied by the taxable-equivalent interest income and expense and the average rate on the Company's earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are presented in Table 4.\n57\nTable 4\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT RATES\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Dollars in millions)\nAverage\nBalance \nInterest\nAverage\nRate \nAverage\nBalance

That growth predominantly reflects an increase in average balances of recreational finance loans of $2.0 billion.\n60\nTable 7 presents the composition of the Company’s loan and lease portfolio at the end of 2024, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, the Mid-Atlantic area, the New England region and other states.\nTable 7\nLOANS AND LEASES\nPercent of Dollars Outstanding\nDecember 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions)\nOutstanding\nNew\nYork\nMid-\nAtlantic (a)\nNew\nEngland (b)\nOther\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n58,740 \n25 \n%\n33 \n%\n14 \n%\n28 \n%\nReal estate:\nResidential\n23,166 \n30 \n31 \n26 \n13 \nCommercial\n26,764 \n33 \n26 \n22 \n19 \nTotal real estate\n49,930 \n31 \n29 \n24 \n16 \nConsumer:\nHome equity lines and loans\n4,592 \n35 \n41 \n23 \n1 \nRecreational finance\n12,564 \n8 \n15 \n6 \n71 \nAutomobile\n4,794 \n24 \n48 \n7 \n21 \nOther secured or guaranteed\n750 \n28 \n41 \n9 \n22 \nOther unsecured\n1,470 \n35 \n53 \n9 \n3 \nTotal consumer\n24,170 \n18 \n30 \n10 \n42 \nTotal loans\n132,840 \n26 \n31 \n17 \n26 \nCommercial leases\n2,741 \n21 \n26 \n9 \n44 \nTotal loans and leases\n$\n135,581 \n26 \n%\n31 \n%\n17 \n%\n26 \n%\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nIncludes Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n(b)\nIncludes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.\nCommercial and industrial loans, including leases, totaled $61.5 billion at December 31, 2024, representing 45% of total loans. Owner-occupied loans secured by real estate included in commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2024 totaled $11.0 billion. The real estate securing such loans is typically used in the primary business operations of the borrower and is not predominantly dependent on rental income from tenants. The Company also provides financing for leases to commercial customers. Commercial leases included in total commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2024 aggregated $2.7 billion.\nCommercial and industrial loans and leases increased $4.5 billion from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 reflecting growth that spanned most industry types. Contributing to that increase was strong demand for credit from motor vehicle and recreational finance dealers. Loans to customers in that industry grew $1.4 billion, or 17%, from the end of 2023. Additionally, loans to customers in the services and the financial and insurance industries increased $877 million, or 10%, and $800 million, or 7%, respectively, in that same period. Borrowers in the financial and insurance industry include real estate investment trusts and other specialty lending businesses including fund banking companies and mortgage warehouse lending businesses.

Maturity dates generally range from five to ten years and, for borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer following maturity at the then-current market rate of interest. Adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 82% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio at the 2024 year end. Table 9 presents commercial real estate loans by type of collateral, geographic area and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2024. The $20.8 billion of permanent finance commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2024 were largely secured by multifamily residential, retail, service and office properties. New York City commercial real estate loans totaled $3.8 billion at December 31, 2024, compared with $4.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of the New England area, the Mid-Atlantic area and New York State comprised 19% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2024.\nCommercial real estate construction and development loans presented in Table 9 totaled $6.0 billion at December 31, 2024, or 4% of total loans and leases. Approximately 96% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at the 2024 year end were loans made for various purposes, including the construction of multifamily residential housing, office buildings, health services facilities and other commercial development. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction portfolio was comprised of loans to builders and developers of residential real estate properties.\nM&T Realty Capital, a commercial real estate lending subsidiary of M&T Bank, participates in the DUS program of Fannie Mae, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by Fannie Mae and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one-third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one-third of the outstanding principal balance. The Company’s maximum credit risk for recourse associated with sold commercial real estate loans was approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, 2024, compared with $3.9 billion at December 31, 2023. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements.\n63\nTable 9\nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS\nNew York State\nDecember 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions)\nNew York City \nOther\nMid-Atlantic (a)\nNew England (b)\nOther \nTotal\nPercent of Total\nPermanent finance by property type:\nApartments/Multifamily\n$\n934 \n$\n1,243 \n$\n1,053 \n$\n1,387 \n$\n1,011 \n$\n5,628 \n21 \n%\nRetail/Service\n859 \n982 \n1,155 \n1,243 \n508 \n4,747 \n18 \nOffice\n568 \n939 \n1,003 \n1,201 \n459 \n4,170 \n16 \nHealth services\n60 \n403 \n750 \n352 \n473 \n2,038 \n8 \nHotel\n135 \n369 \n645 \n438 \n397 \n1,984 \n7 \nIndustrial/Warehouse\n145 \n329 \n535 \n423 \n494 \n1,926 \n7 \nOther\n108 \n77 \n42 \n60 \n— \n287 \n1 \nTotal permanent\n2,809 \n4,342 \n5,183 \n5,104 \n3,342 \n20,780 \n78 \nConstruction/Development:\nCommercial:\nConstruction\n888 \n610 \n1,756 \n676 \n1,032 \n4,962 \n18 \nLand/Land development\n89 \n9 \n56 \n14 \n19 \n187 \n1 \nResidential builder and developer:\nConstruction\n32 \n6 \n47 \n17 \n482 \n584 \n2 \nLand/Land development\n— \n— \n25 \n9 \n217 \n251 \n1 \nTotal construction/development (c)\n1,009 \n625 \n1,884 \n716 \n1,750 \n5,984 \n22 \nTotal commercial real estate \n$\n3,818 \n$\n4,967 \n$\n7,067 \n$\n5,820 \n$\n5,092 \n$\n26,764 \n100 \n%\nPercent of total\n14 \n%\n19 \n%\n26 \n%\n22 \n%\n19 \n%\n100 \n%\nPercent of dollars outstanding by \n   \nloan size:\nLess than $1 million\n3 \n%\n9 \n%\n5 \n%\n6 \n%\n10 \n%\n6 \n%\n$1 million to $10 million\n22 \n40 \n27 \n38 \n18 \n30 \n$10 million to $30 million\n34 \n36 \n36 \n39 \n24 \n34 \n$30 million to $50 million\n13 \n12 \n25 \n14 \n30 \n19 \n$50 million to $100 million\n19 \n3 \n7 \n3 \n16 \n9 \nGreater than $100 million\n9 \n— \n— \n— \n2 \n2 \nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nIncludes Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n(b)\nIncludes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.\n(c)\nTotal includes $299 million of owner-occupied construction loans.\nReal estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties were $23.2 billion at December 31, 2024, including approximately 30% secured by properties located in New York State, 31% secured by properties in the Mid-Atlantic area and 26% secured by properties located in the New England region. The Company’s portfolio of limited documentation residential real estate loans totaled $791 million at December 31, 2024, compared with $911 million at December 31, 2023. That portfolio consisted predominantly of limited documentation loans acquired in a prior business combination. At origination such loans typically included some form of limited borrower documentation requirements as compared with more traditional residential real estate loans. The acquired loans that were eligible for limited documentation processing were available in amounts up to 65% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the property. \n64\nConsumer loans comprised approximately 18% and 16% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Outstanding balances of recreational finance loans represented the largest component of the consumer loan portfolio at December 31, 2024 and totaled $12.6 billion or 9% of total loans, compared with $10.1 billion or 8% at December 31, 2023. Outstanding automobile loan balances were $4.8 billion at December 31, 2024, compared with $4.0 billion at December 31, 2023. Home equity loans and lines of credit outstanding were $4.6 billion at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nInvesting activities\nThe Company's investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of government-issued or guaranteed commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities, but also includes municipal and other securities. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its liquidity position and its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. The Company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of movements in interest rates and spreads, changes in liquidity needs, actual or anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination. The amounts of investment securities held by the Company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments, demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities, ongoing repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios.\nInformation about the Company's average investment securities portfolio is presented in the following table.\nTable 10\nAVERAGE INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nPercentage Change From\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023 to 2024\n2022 to 2023\nInvestment securities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasury\n$\n8,028 \n1 \n%\n58 \n%\nMortgage-backed securities (a)\n6,605 \n115 \n-5 \nOther debt securities\n125 \n-30 \n3 \nTotal available for sale\n14,758 \n32 \n32 \nInvestment securities held to maturity:\nU.S. Treasury\n1,010 \n-3 \n9 \nMortgage-backed securities (a)\n11,363 \n-6 \n55 \nState and political subdivisions\n2,428 \n-4 \n25 \nOther debt securities\n1 \n-25 \n-23 \nTotal held to maturity\n14,802 \n-5 \n46 \nEquity and other securities\n1,195 \n9 \n55 \nTotal investment securities\n$\n30,755 \n10 \n%\n40 \n%\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nPrimarily government issued or guaranteed.\nThe investment securities portfolio averaged $30.8 billion in 2024, up $2.8 billion from 2023. That increase reflects the Company's deployment of liquidity in 2024 and 2023 into primarily fixed-rate investment securities, including the purchase of $5.1 billion of U.S. Treasury securities and $9.3 billion of government-issued or guaranteed commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities into its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. As a result of the elevated interest rate environment and the maturity and paydown of lower-yielding securities, the weighted-average \n65\ncurrent yield for total investment securities available for sale increased from 2.66% at    December 31, 2023 to 4.30% at December 31, 2024, while the weighted-average duration of that portfolio increased from 1.3 years to 2.6 years at each of those respective dates. The Company sold $181 million of non-agency investment securities from its available-for-sale portfolio and its remaining equity investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred securities in 2024. The Company routinely adjusts its holdings of capital stock of the FHLB of New York and the FRB of New York based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities. \nThe Company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of credit-related losses. In light of such reviews, there were no credit-related losses on debt investment securities recognized in 2024, 2023 and 2022. A further discussion of fair values of investment securities is included herein under the heading \"Capital.\" Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes 3 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nOther earning assets include interest-bearing deposits at banks and trading account assets. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $27.3 billion in 2024 and $26.3 billion in 2023 and were primarily comprised of deposits held at the FRB of New York. In general, the levels of those deposits often fluctuate due to changes in deposits of retail and commercial customers, trust-related deposits, brokered deposits and additions to or maturities of investment securities or borrowings. \nFunding activities - deposits\nThe most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits. The Company considers noninterest-bearing deposits, savings and interest-checking deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less as core deposits. The Company’s branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Average core deposits represented 77% of average earning assets in 2024, compared with 79% in 2023. The Company also includes brokered deposits as a component of its wholesale funding strategy. Depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources, the Company may change the amount or composition of brokered deposits in the future. Table 11 summarizes average deposits in 2024 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years.\nTable 11\nAVERAGE DEPOSITS\nPercentage Change From\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023 to 2024\n2022 to 2023\nNoninterest-bearing deposits\n$\n47,260 \n-15 \n%\n-19 \n%\nSavings and interest-checking deposits\n89,136 \n5 \n5 \nTime deposits of $250,000 or less\n11,795 \n46 \n110 \nTotal core deposits\n148,191 \n— \n-4 \nTime deposits greater than $250,000\n3,332 \n46 \n199 \nBrokered deposits\n11,900 \n4 \n194 \nTotal deposits\n$\n163,423 \n1 \n%\n2 \n%\n66\nDeposits averaged $163.4 billion in 2024, a $1.3 billion increase from $162.1 billion in 2023.\n•\nAverage core deposits remained flat in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflecting a stable customer deposit base amidst an elevated interest rate environment and a shift in customer deposits from noninterest-bearing accounts to interest-bearing products, including time deposits.\n•\nThe increase in average brokered deposits in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflects the Company's liquidity management and funding strategies during a period of rising interest rates, partially offset by the maturity of some brokered time deposits in the recent year. Average brokered savings and interest-checking accounts were $8.7 billion in 2024, compared with $4.6 billion in 2023, and the rates paid on those deposits averaged 4.59% and 4.20%, respectively. Brokered time deposits averaged $3.2 billion in 2024, compared with $6.8 billion in 2023, and the rates paid on those deposits averaged 4.96% and 4.95%, respectively. The rate paid on total non-brokered interest-bearing deposits was 2.62% in 2024, compared with 1.98% in 2023. The increase in average rates paid on non-brokered interest-bearing deposits in the recent year reflected repricing of certain deposit products as customers sought higher yields in an elevated interest rate environment.\nTable 12 summarizes the components of average total deposits by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nTable 12\nAVERAGE DEPOSITS BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT\n(Dollars in millions)\nCommercial Bank\nRetail Bank\nInstitutional Services and\nWealth Management\nAll Other\nTotal\n2024\nNoninterest-bearing deposits\n$\n12,478 \n$\n24,938 \n$\n9,168 \n$\n676 \n$\n47,260 \nSavings and interest-checking deposits\n31,509 \n51,629 \n8,071 \n6,615 \n97,824 \nTime deposits\n372 \n14,709 \n42 \n3,216 \n18,339 \nTotal\n$\n44,359 \n$\n91,276 \n$\n17,281 \n$\n10,507 \n$\n163,423 \n2023\nNoninterest-bearing deposits\n$\n17,173 \n$\n28,399 \n$\n9,224 \n$\n678 \n$\n55,474 \nSavings and interest-checking deposits\n24,908 \n53,097 \n7,116 \n4,368 \n89,489 \nTime deposits\n338 \n9,970 \n21 \n6,802 \n17,131 \nTotal\n$\n42,419 \n$\n91,466 \n$\n16,361 \n$\n11,848 \n$\n162,094 \n2022\nNoninterest-bearing deposits\n$\n26,084 \n$\n30,274 \n$\n11,676 \n$\n854 \n$\n68,888 \nSavings and interest-checking deposits\n17,555 \n56,182 \n7,668 \n3,348 \n84,753 \nTime deposits\n189 \n4,399 \n12 \n250 \n4,850 \nTotal\n$\n43,828 \n$\n90,855 \n$\n19,356 \n$\n4,452 \n$\n158,491 \n67\nFunding activities - borrowings\nTable 13 summarizes the average balances utilized from the Company's short-term and long-term borrowing facilities and note programs. \nTable 13\nAVERAGE BORROWINGS\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nShort-term borrowings:\nFederal funds purchased and repurchase agreements\n$\n230 \n$\n430 \n$\n368 \nFHLB advances\n4,210 \n5,328 \n309 \n Other\n— \n— \n259 \nTotal short-term borrowings\n4,440 \n5,758 \n936 \nLong-term borrowings:\nSenior notes\n6,984 \n5,569 \n2,027 \nFHLB advances\n1,835 \n5 \n6 \nSubordinated notes\n771 \n982 \n863 \nJunior subordinated debentures\n537 \n538 \n534 \nAsset-backed notes\n946 \n192 \n— \nOther\n10 \n10 \n10 \nTotal long-term borrowings\n11,083 \n7,296 \n3,440 \nTotal borrowed funds\n$\n15,523 \n$\n13,054 \n$\n4,376 \nThe Company uses borrowing capacity from banks, the FHLBs, the FRB of New York and others as sources of funding. Short-term borrowings represent arrangements that at the time they were entered into had a contractual maturity of one year or less. The lower levels of short-term borrowings in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflect the Company's management of liquidity.\nLong-term borrowings averaged $11.1 billion in 2024 and $7.3 billion in 2023. The increased usage of borrowing facilities in 2024 reflects the Company's strategies to diversify its wholesale funding sources to provide long-term funding stabilization and prepare for proposed regulations enumerating certain long-term debt requirements as described herein in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Resolution Planning and Resolution-Related Requirements.\" Table 14 provides a summary of the Company's issuances, maturities and redemptions of long-term borrowings in 2024.\nTable 14\nLONG-TERM BORROWING ISSUANCES, MATURITIES AND REDEMPTIONS \n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\nIssuances:\nSenior notes of M&T\n$\n2,341 \nFHLB advances\n2,000 \nAsset-backed notes\n1,156 \nMaturities/Redemptions:\nSubordinated notes of M&T and M&T Bank\n475 \nJunior subordinated debentures of M&T associated with Preferred Capital Securities (a)\n130 \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nRedemption resulted in a $20 million loss, which was recognized in Other costs of operations in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nAdditional information regarding outstanding borrowings is provided in notes 8 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. \n68\nNet interest margin\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income can be impacted by changes in the composition of the Company’s earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as discussed herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.57% in 2024, compared with 2.90% in 2023. The decline in the net interest spread in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflects the impact of higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings that outpaced higher yields earned on investment securities, loans and other earning assets. The yield received on earning assets during 2024 was 5.74%, up from 5.50% in 2023. The yield received on investment securities increased 55 basis points to 3.64% in 2024 reflecting purchases of investment securities in 2024 and 2023 with higher yields than maturing securities. The yield received on loans rose 24 basis points to 6.31% in 2024 primarily reflecting the benefit of variable interest rate resets and loan originations at generally higher yields than offsetting loan maturities. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 3.17%, up 57 basis points from 2023 reflecting an increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits of 57 basis points as customers sought higher yields in an elevated interest rate environment and an increase in average long-term borrowings which are generally higher-cost funding sources. \nNet interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and other liabilities and shareholders’ equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest-free funds averaged $61.1 billion in 2024 and $67.3 billion in 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits averaged $47.3 billion in 2024 and $55.5 billion in 2023. The decline in average noninterest-bearing deposits in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflects a shift in deposits to interest-bearing accounts in an elevated interest rate environment. The contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin was 1.01% in 2024 and .93% in 2023. The increased contribution of net-interest free funds in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflects the higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities used to value net interest-free funds.\nReflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interest-free funds as described herein, the Company’s net interest margin was 3.58% in 2024 and 3.83% in 2023. That 25 basis-point narrowing of the net interest margin reflects an increase in the rates paid on the Company's sources of funding which outpaced the rise in yields on earning assets. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in changes to spreads, could impact the Company’s net interest income and net interest margin. Future changes in the levels of net interest-free funds and the interest rates used to value such funds could also impact the Company's net interest margin. \nManagement assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements, the Company generally received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The Company enters into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to hedge interest rate exposures expected in future periods. Table 15 summarizes information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes at December 31, 2024 and 2023. \n69\nTable 15\nINTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS - DESIGNATED AS HEDGES\nNotional Amount\nWeighted-Average\nMaturity\n(In years)\nWeighted-\nAverage Rate \n(Dollars in millions)\nFixed\n \nVariable\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nFair value hedges:\nFixed rate long-term borrowings — active\n$\n2,000 \n5.4\n3.11 \n%\n5.07 \n%\nFixed rate long-term borrowings — forward-starting\n3,350 \n6.2\n3.81 \n4.49 \nFixed rate available for sale securities — active\n15 \n0.1\n4.84 \n4.36 \nTotal fair value hedges\n5,365 \n5.8 \nCash flow hedges:\nVariable rate commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans:\nActive\n20,819 \n0.9\n3.26 \n4.47 \nForward-starting\n10,000 \n3.0\n3.72 \n4.49 \nTotal cash flow hedges\n30,819 \n1.6 \nTotal\n$\n36,184 \n2.2 \nDecember 31, 2023\nFair value hedges:\nFixed rate long-term borrowings — active\n$\n2,000 \n6.4\n3.11 \n%\n5.74 \n%\nFixed rate long-term borrowings — forward-starting\n1,000 \n4.8\n4.13 \n5.37 \nTotal fair value hedges\n3,000 \n5.8 \nCash flow hedges:\nVariable rate commercial real estate loans:\nActive\n14,977 \n1.2\n3.31 \n5.35 \nForward-starting\n9,000 \n2.5\n3.67 \n5.37 \nTotal cash flow hedges\n23,977 \n1.7 \nTotal\n$\n26,977 \n2.2 \nInformation regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges and cash flow hedges is presented in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.

A provision for credit losses of $610 million and $645 million was recorded in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower provision for credit losses in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflects improved performance of loans to commercial real estate borrowers, partially offset by commercial and industrial and consumer loan growth.\nA summary of the Company’s loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in Tables 17 and 23, and in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nTable 17\nLOAN CHARGE-OFFS, PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAllowance for credit losses beginning balance\n$\n2,129 \n$\n1,925 \n$\n1,469 \nCharge-offs:\nCommercial and industrial\n316 \n132 \n119 \nCommercial real estate\n134 \n253 \n60 \nResidential real estate\n6 \n10 \n12 \nConsumer\n257 \n175 \n112 \nTotal charge-offs\n713 \n570 \n303 \nRecoveries:\nCommercial and industrial\n36 \n52 \n60 \nCommercial real estate\n58 \n12 \n23 \nResidential real estate\n6 \n7 \n10 \nConsumer\n58 \n58 \n50 \nTotal recoveries\n158 \n129 \n143 \nNet charge-offs (a)\n555 \n441 \n160 \nAllowance on acquired PCD loans\n— \n— \n99 \nProvision for credit losses (b)\n610 \n645 \n517 \nAllowance for credit losses ending balance\n$\n2,184 \n$\n2,129 \n$\n1,925 \nNet charge-offs as a percent of:\nProvision for credit losses\n90.98 \n%\n68.45 \n%\n30.93 \n%\nAverage loans and leases\n.41 \n.33 \n.13 \nAllowance for credit losses as a percent of:\nLoans and leases, at year-end\n1.61 \n1.59 \n1.46 \nNonaccrual loans, at year-end\n129.24 \n98.28 \n78.96 \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 net charge-offs do not reflect $33 million of charge-offs related to PCD loans acquired on April 1, 2022.\n(b)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 provision for credit losses includes $242 million related to non-PCD acquired loans recorded on April 1, 2022.\n72\nAsset quality \nA summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in Table 18.\nTable 18\nNONPERFORMING ASSET AND PAST DUE LOAN DATA\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNonaccrual loans\n$\n1,690 \n$\n2,166 \n$\n2,439 \nReal estate and other foreclosed assets\n35 \n39 \n41 \nTotal nonperforming assets\n$\n1,725 \n$\n2,205 \n$\n2,480 \nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more (a)\n$\n338 \n$\n339 \n$\n491 \nGovernment-guaranteed loans included in totals above:\nNonaccrual loans\n$\n69 \n$\n53 \n$\n44 \nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more (a)\n318 \n298 \n363 \nLoans 30-89 days past due\n1,655 \n1,724 \n1,779 \nNonaccrual loans as a percent of total loans and leases\n1.25 \n%\n1.62 \n%\n1.85 \n%\nNonperforming assets as a percent of total loans and \n   leases and real estate and other foreclosed assets\n1.27 \n1.64 \n1.88 \nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more as a percent of\n   total loans and leases\n.25 \n.25 \n.37 \nLoans 30-89 days past due as a percent of total loans and leases\n1.22 \n1.29 \n1.35 \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nPredominantly government-guaranteed residential real estate loans.\nThe $476 million decline in nonaccrual loans in the recent year reflects a $507 million reduction in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans, partially offset by a $26 million increase in commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans. Approximately 53% of nonaccrual commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans were considered current with respect to their payment status at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAt December 31, 2024, foreclosed assets were comprised predominantly of the Company's holding of residential real estate-related properties. Net gains or losses associated with real estate and other foreclosed assets were not material in 2024 and 2023.\nGovernment-guaranteed loans designated as accruing loans past due 90 days or more included one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee by the applicable government-related entity remains in force. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans included in the amounts noted herein that are guaranteed by government-related entities totaled $224 million at December 31, 2024 and $228 million at December 31, 2023. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more not guaranteed by government-related entities were loans considered to be with creditworthy borrowers that were in the process of collection or renewal. \nApproximately 73% of loans 30 to 89 days past due were less than 60 days delinquent at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Additional information about past due and nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2024 and 2023 is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nDuring the normal course of business, the Company modifies loans to maximize recovery efforts. The modifications that the Company grants are typically comprised of maturity extensions, payment deferrals and interest rate reductions, but may also include other modification types. The \n73\nCompany may offer such modified terms to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Such modified loans may be considered nonaccrual if the Company does not expect to collect all amounts owed under the terms of the loan agreement. Information about modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nThe Company utilizes a loan grading system to differentiate risk amongst its commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans. Loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible \"pass\" loan grades while specific loans determined to have an elevated level of credit risk are designated as \"criticized.\" A criticized loan may be designated as \"nonaccrual\" if the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts owed under the terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. \nLine of business personnel in different geographic locations with support from and review by the Company’s credit risk personnel review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions. The Company’s policy is that, at least annually, updated financial information is obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis performed. On a quarterly basis, the Company’s centralized credit risk department personnel review criticized commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than $5 million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade, including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing. For criticized nonaccrual loans, additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers, workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships. In analyzing criticized loans, borrower-specific information is reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent developments and the borrower’s outlook, and other pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses, considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the Company’s potential courses of action are contemplated.\nTargeted loan reviews are periodically performed over segments of loan portfolios that may be experiencing heightened credit risk due to current or anticipated economic conditions. The intention of such reviews is to identify trends across such portfolios and inform portfolio risk limits and loss mitigation strategies. In 2023 and 2024, the Company conducted targeted loan reviews covering the majority of its investor-owned commercial real estate portfolio, inclusive of construction loans, with a focus on criticized loans and loans with maturities in the next twelve months. The primary source of repayment of these loans is typically tenant lease payments to the investor/borrower. Elevated vacancies impacting some property types and higher interest rates have contributed to lower current and anticipated future debt service coverage ratios, which have and may continue to influence the ability of borrowers to make existing loan payments. Lower debt service coverage ratios and reduced commercial real estate values also impact the ability of borrowers, in particular those borrowers with loans secured by office properties, to refinance their obligations at loan maturity. Despite these challenges, the ability of borrowers to service loans secured by certain investor-owned real estate, including health services, hotel, retail and multifamily properties, modestly improved in the recent year. Criticized investor-owned commercial real estate loans totaled $6.0 billion or 23% of such loans at December 31, 2024, improved from $8.8 billion or 27% of such loans at December 31, 2023. Investor-owned commercial real estate loans comprised 61% of total criticized loans at December 31, 2024, compared with 70% at December 31, 2023. \nThe LTV ratio is one of many factors considered in assessing overall portfolio risks and loss mitigation strategies for the investor-owned commercial real estate portfolio. The weighted-average LTV ratio for investor-owned commercial real estate loans at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 56%. Criticized loans secured by investor-owned commercial real estate had a \n74\nweighted-average LTV ratio of approximately 63% and 61% at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In determining the LTV ratio, the Company considers cross-collateralization of all exposures secured by the supporting collateral and the estimated value of such collateral. Subsequent to the origination of commercial real estate loans, updated appraisals are obtained in the normal course of business for renewals, extensions and modifications to commitment levels. As the quality of a loan deteriorates to the point of designating the loan as \"criticized nonaccrual,\" the process of obtaining updated collateral valuation information is usually initiated, unless it is not considered warranted given factors such as the relative size of the loan or the age of the last valuation. In those cases where current appraisals may not yet be available, prior appraisals are utilized with adjustments, as deemed necessary, for estimates of subsequent declines in values as determined by line of business and/or loan workout personnel. Those adjustments are reviewed and assessed for reasonableness by the Company’s credit risk personnel. Accordingly, for real estate collateral securing larger nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans, estimated collateral values are generally based on current appraisals and estimates of value.\nThe Company monitors its concentration of commercial real estate lending as a percent of its Tier 1 capital plus its allowable allowance for credit losses, consistent with a metric utilized to differentiate such concentrations amongst regulated financial institutions. This metric, as prescribed in supervisory guidance, excludes loans secured by commercial real estate considered to be owner-occupied, but includes certain other loans, such as loans to real estate investment trusts, that are classified as commercial and industrial loans. The Company's commercial real estate loan concentration approximated 136% of Tier 1 capital plus its allowable allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2024, down from 183% at December 31, 2023. The Company has intentionally reduced its relative concentration of investor-owned commercial real estate loans throughout 2024 and 2023.\nTables 19 and 20 summarize the outstanding balances, and associated criticized balances, of commercial and industrial loans and leases by industry and commercial real estate loans by property type, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n75\nTable 19\nCRITICIZED COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\nOutstanding\nCriticized Accrual\nCriticized Nonaccrual\nTotal Criticized\nOutstanding\nCriticized Accrual\nCriticized Nonaccrual\nTotal Criticized\nCommercial and industrial excluding \n   owner-occupied real estate by industry:\nFinancial and insurance \n$\n11,479 \n$\n71 \n$\n35 \n$\n106 \n$\n10,679 \n$\n346 \n$\n3 \n$\n349 \nServices\n7,409 \n247 \n112 \n359 \n6,715 \n295 \n100 \n395 \nMotor vehicle and recreational \n   finance dealers\n7,229 \n527 \n38 \n565 \n6,242 \n164 \n51 \n215 \nManufacturing\n6,077 \n394 \n116 \n510 \n5,981 \n549 \n65 \n614 \nWholesale \n4,057 \n334 \n28 \n362 \n3,803 \n180 \n45 \n225 \nTransportation, communications, \n   utilities\n3,567 \n286 \n62 \n348 \n3,342 \n195 \n71 \n266 \nRetail\n3,097 \n66 \n17 \n83 \n2,727 \n102 \n35 \n137 \nConstruction\n2,143 \n155 \n44 \n199 \n2,092 \n173 \n62 \n235 \nHealth services\n1,892 \n207 \n36 \n243 \n1,950 \n297 \n28 \n325 \nReal estate investors\n1,751 \n148 \n8 \n156 \n1,684 \n189 \n4 \n193 \nOther\n1,773 \n109 \n39 \n148 \n1,889 \n123 \n50 \n173 \nTotal commercial and industrial \n   excluding owner-occupied real estate\n$\n50,474 \n$\n2,544 \n$\n535 \n$\n3,079 \n$\n47,104 \n$\n2,613 \n$\n514 \n$\n3,127 \nOwner-occupied real estate by industry:\nServices\n$\n2,345 \n$\n153 \n$\n26 \n$\n179 \n$\n2,162 \n$\n154 \n$\n51 \n$\n205 \nMotor vehicle and recreational \n   finance dealers\n2,236 \n31 \n8 \n39 \n1,867 \n10 \n7 \n17 \nRetail\n1,677 \n69 \n16 \n85 \n1,541 \n107 \n13 \n120 \nHealth services\n1,330 \n156 \n66 \n222 \n656 \n55 \n26 \n81 \nWholesale\n857 \n62 \n3 \n65 \n940 \n28 \n2 \n30 \nManufacturing\n809 \n73 \n24 \n97 \n842 \n64 \n24 \n88 \nReal estate investors\n702 \n43 \n6 \n49 \n818 \n26 \n12 \n38 \nOther\n1,051 \n54 \n12 \n66 \n1,080 \n32 \n21 \n53 \nTotal owner-occupied real estate\n11,007 \n641 \n161 \n802 \n9,906 \n476 \n156 \n632 \nTotal\n$\n61,481 \n$\n3,185 \n$\n696 \n$\n3,881 \n$\n57,010 \n$\n3,089 \n$\n670 \n$\n3,759 \nTable 20\nCRITICIZED COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\nOutstanding\nCriticized Accrual\nCriticized Nonaccrual\nTotal Criticized\nOutstanding\nCriticized Accrual\nCriticized Nonaccrual\nTotal Criticized\nPermanent finance by property type:\nApartments/Multifamily\n$\n5,628 \n$\n935 \n$\n114 \n$\n1,049 \n$\n6,165 \n$\n1,184 \n$\n115 \n$\n1,299 \nRetail/Service\n4,747 \n673 \n80 \n753 \n5,912 \n1,075 \n227 \n1,302 \nOffice\n4,170 \n1,125 \n117 \n1,242 \n4,727 \n879 \n185 \n1,064 \nHealth services\n2,038 \n560 \n25 \n585 \n3,615 \n1,364 \n117 \n1,481 \nHotel\n1,984 \n317 \n118 \n435 \n2,510 \n496 \n210 \n706 \nIndustrial/Warehouse\n1,926 \n143 \n13 \n156 \n2,034 \n224 \n13 \n237 \nOther\n287 \n30 \n1 \n31 \n314 \n28 \n2 \n30 \nTotal permanent\n20,780 \n3,783 \n468 \n4,251 \n25,277 \n5,250 \n869 \n6,119 \nConstruction/Development\n5,984 \n1,715 \n68 \n1,783 \n7,726 \n2,527 \n174 \n2,701 \nTotal\n$\n26,764 \n$\n5,498 \n$\n536 \n$\n6,034 \n$\n33,003 \n$\n7,777 \n$\n1,043 \n$\n8,820 \n76\nTotal criticized commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans were $9.9 billion at the end of 2024 as compared with $12.6 billion at December 31, 2023. Criticized loans represented 11.2% of total commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2024, compared with 14.0% at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, permanent finance commercial real estate loans comprised 43% of total criticized loans, compared with 49% at December 31, 2023. Commercial and industrial loans represented 39% and 30% of total criticized loans at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, construction loans represented 18% of total criticized loans, compared with 21% at December 31, 2023. Loans to nonautomotive finance dealers, partially offset by a decline in loans to financial and insurance businesses, contributed to the $122 million net increase in commercial and industrial criticized loans in the recent year. The $2.8 billion decline in criticized commercial real estate loans from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 reflected decreases across most property types, except for such loans secured by office properties. At December 31, 2024, approximately 97% of criticized accrual loans and 53% of criticized nonaccrual loans were considered current with respect to their payment status.\n For loans secured by residential real estate the Company’s loss identification and estimation techniques make reference to loan performance and house price data in specific areas of the country where collateral securing those loans is located. For residential real estate-related loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days delinquent. That charge-off is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual. Loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged-off to estimated net collateral value shortly after the Company is notified of such filings. Limited documentation first lien mortgage loans represent loans secured by residential real estate that at origination typically included some form of limited borrower documentation requirements as compared with more traditional loans. The Company no longer originates limited documentation loans. With respect to junior lien loans, to the extent known by the Company, if a related senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency, even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the Company, the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the Company is placed on nonaccrual status. In monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent charge-off experience. When evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge-off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company considers the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property. Information about the location of nonaccrual loans secured by residential real estate at December 31, 2024 is presented in Table 21.\n77\nTable 21\nNONACCRUAL LOANS SECURED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE\nDecember 31, 2024\nNonaccrual \n(Dollars in millions)\nOutstanding\nBalances\nBalances\nPercent of\nOutstanding\nBalances\nResidential mortgage loans (a):\nNew York\n$\n6,898 \n$\n120 \n1.74 \n%\nMid-Atlantic (b)\n7,229 \n84 \n1.16 \nNew England (c)\n6,090 \n53 \n.87 \nOther\n2,949 \n22 \n.76 \nTotal\n$\n23,166 \n$\n279 \n1.20 \n%\nFirst lien home equity loans and lines of credit:\nNew York\n$\n769 \n$\n15 \n1.92 \n%\nMid-Atlantic (b)\n908 \n21 \n2.33 \nNew England (c)\n435 \n5 \n1.26 \nOther\n15 \n3 \n17.06 \nTotal\n$\n2,127 \n$\n44 \n2.07 \n%\nJunior lien home equity loans and lines of credit:\nNew York\n$\n828 \n$\n15 \n1.76 \n%\nMid-Atlantic (b)\n984 \n15 \n1.53 \nNew England (c)\n622 \n7 \n1.15 \nOther\n31 \n— \n.85 \nTotal\n$\n2,465 \n$\n37 \n1.50 \n%\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nIncludes $791 million of limited documentation first lien mortgage loans with nonaccrual loan balances totaling $59 million.\n(b)\nIncludes Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n(c)\nIncludes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.\nFactors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers.\nConsumer loans not secured by residential real estate are generally charged-off when the loans are 91 to 180 days past due, depending on whether the loan is collateralized and the status of repossession activities with respect to such collateral. A comparative summary of consumer loans in nonaccrual status by product is presented in Table 22. \n78\nTable 22\nNONACCRUAL CONSUMER LOANS\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Dollars in millions)\nNonaccrual Loans\nPercent of Outstanding Balances\nNonaccrual Loans\nPercent of Outstanding Balances\nNonaccrual Loans\nPercent of Outstanding Balances\nHome equity lines and loans\n$\n81 \n1.77 \n%\n$\n81 \n1.74 \n%\n$\n85 \n1.69 \n%\nRecreational finance\n31 \n.25 \n36 \n.35 \n45 \n.49 \nAutomobile\n12 \n.25 \n14 \n.36 \n40 \n.88 \nOther\n55 \n2.49 \n52 \n2.55 \n49 \n2.43 \nTotal\n$\n179 \n.74 \n%\n$\n183 \n.89 \n%\n$\n219 \n1.06 \n%\nNet charge-offs of commercial and industrial loans and leases in 2024 increased $200 million from 2023, reflecting higher net charge-offs of loans to the manufacturing and service industries and recreational finance dealers, and equipment finance loans and leases.

A description of the methodologies used by the Company to estimate its allowance for credit losses can be found in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. \nIn establishing the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and also estimates losses for other loans and leases with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by type. At the time of the Company’s analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 concerns existed about the impact of elevated levels of inflation and potential increases in unemployment on the discretionary income and purchasing power of consumers, which could impact their ability to service existing debt obligations; slower economic growth in future quarters; the volatile nature of global markets and international economic conditions that could impact the U.S. economy; uncertainty related to Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; potential changes to federal taxation rates; the impact of international trade policies on domestic businesses; downward pressures on commercial real estate values, especially in the office sector; elevated interest rates impacting the ability of commercial borrowers to refinance maturing debt obligations; and the extent to which borrowers may be negatively affected by general economic conditions.\nThe Company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. To estimate expected losses, the Company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company’s approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at each reporting date included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. Subsequent to the forecast period, the Company reverted to longer-term historical loss experience, over a period of one year, to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life. In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company may adjust forecasted loss estimates for inherent limitations or biases in the models as well as for other factors that may not be adequately considered in its quantitative methodologies including the impact of portfolio concentrations, imprecision in economic forecasts, geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence the loss estimation process. At each of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company qualitatively adjusted credit loss estimates for inherent limitations in the ability to assess real-time changes in commercial borrower performance and for environmental influences affecting certain loan portfolios. Qualitative adjustments, primarily related to portfolio exposures to certain commercial and industrial borrowers, commercial real estate loans secured by office properties and recreational finance consumer loans, partially contributed to the increased allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2024 as compared with December 31, 2023.\nForward-looking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the M&T Scenario Review Committee, which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists. The weighted-average of macroeconomic assumptions utilized as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are presented in Table 24 and were based on information available at or near the time the Company was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates.\n80\nTable 24\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nYear 1 \nYear 2 \nCumulative \nYear 1 \nYear 2 \nCumulative \nYear 1 \nYear 2 \nCumulative \nNational unemployment rate\n4.5 \n%\n4.7 \n%\n4.4 \n%\n4.7 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n4.1 \n%\nReal GDP growth rate\n1.3 \n1.7 \n3.0 \n%\n.9 \n1.9 \n2.8 \n%\n1.0 \n2.5 \n3.5 \n%\nCommercial real estate price \n    index growth/decline rate\n-2.9 \n1.4 \n-1.4 \n-9.1 \n4.8 \n-4.5 \n-1.3 \n3.3 \n1.9 \nHome price index growth/ \n    decline rate\n-.1 \n2.4 \n2.3 \n-3.2 \n-.1 \n-3.3 \n-3.2 \n-3.1 \n-6.2 \nWith respect to economic forecasts, the Company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. Generally, an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in GDP, commercial real estate prices or home prices could have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and may result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses. Forward-looking economic forecasts are subject to inherent imprecision and future outcomes may differ materially from forecasted events. In consideration of such uncertainty, the alternative economic scenarios shown in Table 25 were considered to estimate the possible impact on modeled credit losses.\nTable 25\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES SENSITIVITIES\nDecember 31, 2024\nYear 1 \nYear 2 \nCumulative \nPotential downside economic scenario:\nNational unemployment rate\n7.0 \n%\n8.0 \n%\nReal GDP growth/decline rate\n-2.4 \n1.7 \n-.7 \n%\nCommercial real estate price index decline rate\n-14.8 \n-6.0 \n-20.0 \nHome price index growth/decline rate\n-9.3 \n2.3 \n-7.2 \nPotential upside economic scenario:\nNational unemployment rate\n3.4 \n3.2 \nReal GDP growth rate\n3.3 \n2.0 \n5.4 \nCommercial real estate price index growth rate\n2.0 \n4.7 \n6.8 \nHome price index growth rate\n4.5 \n4.3 \n9.0 \n(Dollars in millions)\nImpact to Modeled \nCredit Losses \nIncrease (Decrease) \nPotential downside economic scenario\n$\n364 \nPotential upside economic scenario\n(118)\nThese examples are only a few of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of expected credit losses. The estimated impacts on credit losses in such scenarios pertain only to modeled credit losses and do not include consideration of other factors the Company may evaluate when determining its allowance for credit losses. As a result, it is possible that the Company may, at another point in time, reach different conclusions regarding credit loss estimates. The Company’s process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk management personnel, which among many other considerations, evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methodology and significant \n81\nassumptions. Further information about the Company’s methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nA comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past three year ends is presented in Table 26. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year-end assessment and using the methodologies described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percent of those loans reflect changes in management’s estimate of credit losses in light of economic developments. Furthermore, the Company’s allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nTable 26\nALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n769 \n$\n620 \n$\n568 \nCommercial real estate\n599 \n764 \n611 \nResidential real estate\n108 \n116 \n115 \nConsumer\n708 \n629 \n631 \nTotal\n$\n2,184 \n$\n2,129 \n$\n1,925 \nAs a percent of loans and leases:\nCommercial and industrial\n1.25 \n%\n1.09 \n%\n1.09 \n%\nCommercial real estate\n2.24 \n2.31 \n1.73 \nResidential real estate\n.47 \n.50 \n.48 \nConsumer\n2.93 \n3.03 \n3.07 \nTotal\n1.61 \n1.59 \n1.46 \nManagement has assessed that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2024 appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The increase in the allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans and leases outstanding from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 reflects a higher level of credit losses expected on certain commercial borrowers and growth in consumer recreational finance loans. Included in the allocation of the allowance for credit losses were reserves for loans secured by office properties of 4.70% at December 31, 2024 and 4.37% at December 31, 2023. The level of the allowance reflects management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein. Should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should management’s assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change, the level of the allowance as a percent of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The reported level of the allowance for credit losses reflects management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. \nThe ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans at the end of 2024 and 2023 was 129% and 98%, respectively. Given the Company’s general position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful, that ratio and changes in the ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for credit losses, nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for credit losses.\n82\nOther Income\nThe components of other income are presented in Table 27.\nTable 27\nOTHER INCOME\nChange from\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 to 2024\n2022 to 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nMortgage banking revenues\n$\n436 \n$\n409 \n$\n357 \n$\n27 \n7 \n%\n$\n52 \n15 \n%\nService charges on deposit accounts\n514 \n475 \n447 \n39 \n8 \n28 \n6 \nTrust income\n675 \n680 \n741 \n(5)\n-1 \n(61)\n-8 \nBrokerage services income\n121 \n102 \n88 \n19 \n19 \n14 \n17 \nTrading account and other non-hedging derivative gains\n39 \n49 \n27 \n(10)\n-21 \n22 \n84 \nGain (loss) on bank investment securities\n10 \n4 \n(6)\n6 \n158 \n10 \n— \nOther revenues from operations\n632 \n809 \n703 \n(177)\n-22 \n106 \n15 \nTotal other income\n$\n2,427 \n$\n2,528 \n$\n2,357 \n$\n(101)\n-4 \n%\n$\n171 \n7 \n%\nMortgage banking revenues\nMortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities, which consist of realized gains and losses from sales of real estate loans and loan servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on real estate loans held for sale and related commitments, real estate loan servicing fees, and other real estate loan related fees and income. The Company’s involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the multifamily loan programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n83\nTable 28\nRESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES\nChange from\nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended \n2023 to 2024\n2022 to 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nResidential mortgage banking revenues\nGains (losses) on loans originated for sale\n$\n31 \n$\n25 \n$\n(2)\n$\n6 \n28 \n%\n$\n27 \n— \n%\nLoan servicing fees\n150 \n132 \n83 \n18 \n13 \n49 \n58 \nLoan sub-servicing and other fees\n124 \n125 \n154 \n(1)\n-1 \n(29)\n-19 \nTotal loan servicing revenues\n274 \n257\n237\n17\n6 \n20\n8 \nTotal residential mortgage banking revenues\n$\n305 \n$\n282 \n$\n235 \n$\n23 \n8 \n%\n$\n47 \n20 \n%\nNew commitments to originate loans for sale\n$\n1,375 \n$\n1,255 \n$\n314 \n$\n120 \n10 \n%\n$\n941 \n300 \n%\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nBalances at period end\nLoans held for sale\n$\n211 \n$\n190 \nCommitments to originate loans for sale\n190 \n163 \nCommitments to sell loans\n353 \n295 \nCapitalized mortgage loan servicing assets (a)\n368 \n456 \nLoans serviced for others\n38,105 \n40,021 \nLoans sub-serviced for others (b)\n111,544 \n115,321 \nTotal loans serviced for others\n$\n149,649 \n$\n155,342 \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nAdditional information about the Company's capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented in note 6 of Notes to Financial Statements.\n(b)\nThe contractual servicing rights associated with residential mortgage loans sub-serviced by the Company were primarily held by affiliates of BLG.

The Institutional Services business provides a variety of trustee, agency, investment management and administrative services for corporations and institutions, investment bankers, corporate tax, finance and legal executives, and other institutional clients who: (i) use capital markets financing structures; (ii) use independent trustees to hold assets (including retirement plan assets prior to the sale of CIT); and (iii) need investment and cash management services. The Wealth Management business offers personal trust, planning and advisory, fiduciary, asset management, family office and other services designed to help high net worth individuals and families grow, preserve and transfer wealth. \n85\nTable 30\nTRUST INCOME AND ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT\nChange from\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 to 2024\n2022 to 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nTrust income\nInstitutional Services\n$\n349 \n$\n369 \n$\n442 \n$\n(20)\n-6 \n%\n$\n(73)\n-16 \n%\nWealth Management\n323 \n309 \n299 \n14 \n5 \n10 \n3 \nCommercial\n3 \n2 \n— \n1 \n61 \n2 \n100 \nTotal trust income\n$\n675 \n$\n680 \n$\n741 \n$\n(5)\n-1 \n%\n$\n(61)\n-8 \n%\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets under management at period end\nTrust assets under management (excluding proprietary funds)\n$\n65,798 \n$\n63,963 \nProprietary mutual funds\n14,461 \n14,772 \nTotal assets under management\n$\n80,259 \n$\n78,735 \nIn April 2023, M&T completed the divestiture of its CIT business to a private equity firm. Revenues associated with that business and included in Institutional Services trust income totaled $60 million and $165 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. After considering expenses, the results of operations of that business were not material to M&T's net income in 2023 and 2022. Institutional Services trust income not related to the CIT business increased $40 million in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflecting higher sales and fund management fees from its global capital markets business. The rise in trust income from the Wealth Management business in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflected the impact of higher levels of assets under management and improved market performance associated with those managed assets.\nBrokerage services income\nBrokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities, securities brokerage fees and select investment products of LPL Financial, an independent financial services broker, increased $19 million in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflecting higher sales of annuities. \nTrading account and other non-hedging derivative gains\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other non-hedging contracts entered into by the Company is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading \"Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity.\" The decline in income from trading account and other non-hedging derivative gains in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflects lower revenues from interest rate swap transactions with commercial customers.\n86\nGain (loss) on bank investment securities\nThe Company recognized a net gain on investment securities of $10 million in 2024, compared with a net gain of $4 million in 2023. In 2024, the Company divested of certain debt and equity investment securities that were not considered relevant in its current balance sheet management strategies. The net gain in 2024 reflects realized gains on the sale of equity investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred securities, partially offset by net realized losses on the sale of certain non-agency debt investment securities.\nOther revenues from operations\nThe components of other revenues from operations are presented in Table 31.\nTable 31\nOTHER REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS\nChange from\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 to 2024\n2022 to 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nLetter of credit and other credit-related fees\n$\n197 \n$\n187 \n$\n165 \n$\n10 \n5 \n%\n$\n22 \n14 \n%\nMerchant discount and credit card fees\n174 \n172 \n169 \n2 \n1 \n3 \n2 \nBank owned life insurance revenue (a)\n65 \n63 \n44 \n2 \n2 \n19 \n45 \nBLG income (b)\n48 \n20 \n30 \n28 \n140 \n(10)\n-33 \nEquipment operating lease income\n44 \n56 \n43 \n(12)\n-20 \n13 \n29 \nInsurance income\n19 \n18 \n48 \n1 \n9 \n(30)\n-63 \nGain on divestiture of CIT\n— \n225 \n— \n(225)\n-100 \n225 \n100 \nGain on divestiture of MTIA\n— \n— \n136 \n— \n— \n(136)\n-100 \nOther\n85 \n68 \n68 \n17 \n24 \n— \n— \nTotal other revenues from operations\n$\n632 \n$\n809 \n$\n703 \n$\n(177)\n-22 \n%\n$\n106 \n15 \n%\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nTax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance includes increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. The Company owns both general account and separate account life insurance policies. To the extent market conditions change such that the market value of assets in a separate account bank owned life insurance policy becomes less than the previously recorded cash surrender value, an adjustment is recorded as a reduction to other revenues from operations.\n(b)\nDuring 2017, the operating losses of BLG resulted in M&T reducing the carrying value of its investment in BLG to zero. Subsequently, M&T has received cash distributions when declared by BLG that result in the recognition of income by M&T. M&T expects cash distributions from BLG in the future, but the timing and amount of those distributions are not within M&T's control. BLG is entitled to receive distributions from its affiliates that provide asset management and other services that are available for distribution to BLG’s owners, including M&T. Information about the Company’s relationship with BLG and its affiliates is included in note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nOther revenues from operations in 2024 declined $177 million from 2023 reflecting a $225 million gain on the sale of the CIT business in April 2023 and a decline in equipment operating lease income reflecting higher gains on sales of leased equipment in 2023. Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by a $28 million increase in distributions received from M&T's investment in BLG and a $10 million rise in letter of credit and other credit-related fees, reflecting higher lines of credit and line usage fees, partially offset by lower loan syndication fees.\n87\nOther Expense\nThe components of other expense are presented in Table 32.\nTable 32\nOTHER EXPENSE\nChange from\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 to 2024\n2022 to 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022 (a)\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$\n3,162 \n$\n2,997 \n$\n2,787 \n$\n165 \n6 \n%\n$\n210 \n8 \n%\nEquipment and net occupancy\n512 \n520 \n474 \n(8)\n-2 \n46 \n10 \nOutside data processing and software\n492 \n437 \n376 \n55 \n13 \n61 \n16 \nProfessional and other services\n344 \n413 \n509 \n(69)\n-17 \n(96)\n-19 \nFDIC assessments\n146 \n315 \n90 \n(169)\n-54 \n225 \n249 \nAdvertising and marketing\n104 \n108 \n90 \n(4)\n-3 \n18 \n19 \nAmortization of core deposit and other \n  intangible assets\n53 \n62 \n56 \n(9)\n-15 \n6 \n12 \nOther costs of operations\n546 \n527 \n668 \n19 \n3 \n(141)\n-21 \nTotal other expense\n$\n5,359 \n$\n5,379 \n$\n5,050 \n$\n(20)\n— \n%\n$\n329 \n7 \n%\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n(a)\nIncludes merger-related expenses considered \"nonoperating\" in nature totaling $338 million in 2022. Table 3 provides a summary of merger-related expenses in the reconciliation of GAAP amounts to non-GAAP measures. No merger-related expenses were incurred in 2024 and 2023.\nSalaries and employee benefits\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $165 million in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflecting higher salaries expense from annual merit and other increases and a rise in incentive compensation, partially offset by lower average staffing levels. The average number of full-time equivalent employees was 22,027 in 2024 as compared with 22,664 in 2023, whereas full-time equivalent employees totaled 22,101 and 21,980 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense totaled $116 million in 2024 as compared with $118 million in 2023.\nThe Company provides pension, retirement savings and other postretirement benefits for its employees. Expenses related to such benefits totaled $71 million in 2024 and $74 million in 2023. The amounts recorded in salaries and employee benefits expense and other costs of operations, respectively, from the preceding sentence were as follows: $173 million and ($102 million) in 2024; and $164 million and ($90 million) in 2023. The Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Pension expense for those plans was a net benefit of $28 million in 2024 and $21 million in 2023. Components of pension expense included in other costs of operations reflect the amortization of net unrecognized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income. In the recent year, the Company recognized a $12 million benefit in other costs of operations associated with the solicited election of certain participants in M&T's defined benefit pension plan to accept a lump-sum distribution in the fourth quarter of 2024 in lieu of future retirement benefit payments. Approximately $171 million of lump-sum settlements were distributed from the pension plan in December 2024, representing approximately 8% of the plan's accumulated benefit obligation at that time. The Company does not expect that such distribution will have a material impact on its noninterest expense in 2025. Information about the Company’s pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company’s retirement savings plan is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via \n88\ncontributions to the plan. Retirement savings plan expense reflecting the Company’s employer matching contribution was $100 million in 2024 and $96 million in 2023.\nNonpersonnel expenses\nAs described herein within Part I, Item 1, \"Business,\" on November 16, 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule that imposes a special assessment to recover the costs to the DIF resulting from the FDIC’s use in 2023 of the systemic risk exception to the least-cost resolution test under the FDIA in connection with the receiverships of certain failed banks. Based on estimates at the time the rule was finalized and subsequent information provided by the FDIC regarding the estimated costs of resolution, the Company recognized expense for the special assessment of $34 million in 2024 and $197 million in 2023 in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nAfter considering FDIC assessments, the $16 million decrease in nonpersonnel expenses in 2024 as compared with 2023 reflects a decline in professional and other services expense of $69 million, predominantly from lower sub-advisory fees as a result of the sale of the CIT business in April 2023 and a decline in management consulting costs, a decrease in losses associated with certain retail banking activities and a benefit related to voluntary lump-sum distributions to certain M&T pension plan participants. Partially offsetting those favorable factors were higher outside data processing and software costs of $55 million, vacated facility write-downs of $27 million in 2024 and losses on the redemption of certain issuances of M&T's Junior Subordinated Debentures of $20 million in 2024 as described in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $722 million in 2024, compared with $878 million in 2023. The effective tax rates were 21.8% and 24.3% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax expense in 2024 reflects a $14 million discrete tax benefit related to certain tax credits claimed on a prior year return and a $17 million net discrete tax benefit related to the resolution of an income tax matter inherited from the acquisition of People's United. The Company's effective tax rate is affected by the level of income earned that is exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pre-tax income, the amount of income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax rates differ among such jurisdictions, and the impact of any large discrete or infrequently occurring items. The Company’s effective tax rate in future periods may also be affected by any change in income tax laws or regulations and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company’s interpretations by any of the various tax authorities that may examine tax returns filed by M&T or any of its subsidiaries. Information about amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions and a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements. \nLiquidity Risk\nAs a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Company’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the cash flows associated with financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.\nThe most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the Company’s businesses over time. Nevertheless, the Company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of \n89\nfinancial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits totaled $147.5 billion at December 31, 2024, compared with $146.5 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in core deposits since December 31, 2023 reflects higher savings and interest-checking deposits, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing deposits, as customers shifted funds to interest-bearing accounts in an elevated interest rate environment, and maturing time deposits.\nThe Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including overnight federal funds purchases, repurchase agreements, advances from the FHLBs, brokered deposits and longer-term borrowings. M&T Bank has access to additional funding sources through secured borrowings from the FHLB of New York and the FRB of New York. M&T Bank is also a counterparty to the FRB of New York standing repurchase agreement facility, which allows it to enter into overnight repurchase transactions using eligible investment securities. M&T has, in the past, issued Junior Subordinated Debentures associated with trust preferred obligations to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, long-term borrowings aggregated $12.6 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, and short-term borrowings aggregated $1.1 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. Information about the Company’s borrowings is included in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nThe Company's wholesale funding sources include the placement of brokered deposits. The Company had brokered savings and interest-checking deposit accounts which aggregated $9.8 billion and $7.8 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Brokered time deposits declined $5.1 billion to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 from $6.1 billion at December 31, 2023, as brokered time deposits matured. The change in the composition and levels of brokered deposits during 2024 as compared with 2023, reflects a mix shift in the Company's wholesale funding strategy. Approximately 69% of brokered time deposits at December 31, 2024 have a contractual maturity date in 2025. \nTotal uninsured deposits were estimated to be $73.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and $67.0 billion at December 31, 2023. Approximately $9.1 billion and $10.7 billion of those uninsured deposits were collateralized by the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company maintains available liquidity sources, as presented in Table 38, which represent approximately 133% of uninsured deposits that are not collateralized by the Company at December 31, 2024.\nThe Company’s ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such risks by conducting scenario analyses that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a debt ratings downgrade and other market events. Such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. \n90\nInformation about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank at December 31, 2024 is presented in Table 33. \nTable 33\nDEBT RATINGS\nMoody’s\nStandard\nand Poor’s\nFitch\nMorningstar DBRS\nM&T:\nSenior debt\nBaa1\nBBB+\nA\nA\nSubordinated debt\nBaa1\nBBB\nA-\nA (low)\nM&T Bank:\nShort-term deposits\nPrime-1\nA-2\nF1\nR-1 (middle)\nLong-term deposits\nA1\nA-\nA+\nA (high)\nSenior debt\nA3\nA-\nA\nA (high)\nSubordinated debt\nA3\nBBB+\nA-\nA\nM&T’s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any bank subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of that test, at December 31, 2024, approximately $2.3 billion was available for payment of dividends to M&T from bank subsidiaries. M&T may also obtain funding through long-term borrowings and the repayment of advances to subsidiaries. Further information about the long-term outstanding borrowings of M&T is provided in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. As a BHC, M&T is obligated to serve as a managerial and financial source of strength to its bank subsidiaries as described in Part I, Item 1, \"Business,\" and may provide advances to those subsidiaries. As its ability to access the capital markets may be affected by market disruptions, M&T maintains sufficient resources at its parent company to satisfy projected cash outflows for an extended period without reliance on dividends from subsidiaries or external financing. As of December 31, 2024, M&T's parent company liquidity, inclusive of the projected repayment of notes receivable from bank subsidiaries, covered projected cash outflows for 44 months, including dividends on common and preferred stock, debt service and scheduled debt maturities.\nIn addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities and repayments of investment securities, loans and other earning assets, as well as cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services. The Company also has the ability to securitize or sell certain financial assets, including various loan types, to provide other liquidity alternatives. U.S. Treasury and government-issued or guaranteed mortgage-backed securities comprised 93% of the Company's debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2024.

As a Category IV institution, the Company adheres to enhanced liquidity standards which require the performance of internal liquidity stress testing. The stress testing is designed to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to withstand both institution-specific and market-wide stress scenarios. For each scenario, the Company applies liquidity stress which may include deposit run-off, increased draws on unfunded loan commitments, increased collateral need for margin calls, increased haircuts on investment security-based funding and reductions in unsecured and secured borrowing capacity. Stress scenarios are measured over various time frames ranging from overnight to twelve months. As required by regulation, the Company maintains a liquidity buffer comprised of cash and highly liquid unencumbered securities to cover a 30-day stress horizon. Liquidity stress events occurring over longer time horizons can be mitigated by the availability of secured funding sources at the FHLB of \n94\nNew York and FRB of New York. Presented in Table 38 is a summary of the Company's available sources of liquidity at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nTable 38\nAVAILABLE LIQUIDITY SOURCES\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nDeposits at the FRB of New York\n$\n18,805 \n$\n27,957 \nUnused secured borrowing facilities:\nFRB of New York\n24,546 \n17,106 \nFHLB of New York\n17,655 \n16,765 \nUnencumbered investment securities (after estimated haircuts)\n24,019 \n16,480 \nTotal\n$\n85,025 \n$\n78,308 \nManagement continuously evaluates the use and mix of its various available funding alternatives, including short-term borrowings, issuances of long-term debt, the placement of brokered deposits and the securitization of certain loan products. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks. In accordance with liquidity regulations, the Company maintains a contingency funding plan to facilitate on-going liquidity management in times of liquidity stress. The plan outlines various funding options available during a liquidity stress event and establishes a clear escalation protocol to be followed within the Company's Risk Framework. The plan sets forth funding strategies and procedures that management can quickly leverage to assist in decision-making and specifies roles and responsibilities for departments impacted by a potential liquidity stress event.\nMarket Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nMarket risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and/or interest rates of the Company’s financial instruments. A primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Company’s core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Management’s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. \nThe Company’s Executive ALCO Committee monitors the sensitivity of the Company’s net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that contemplate both parallel (that is, when interest rates at each point of the yield curve change by the same magnitude) and non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to change by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. The Company also contemplates instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve over the scenario time horizon. In utilizing the model, market-implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared with the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of \n95\nongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. \nManagement has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. At December 31, 2024, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was $22.8 billion. In addition, the Company has entered into $13.4 billion of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements designated for hedging purposes. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading \"Net interest margin\" and in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nThe accompanying table as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenarios described above resulting from changes in market interest rates. The scenarios presented in the table below assume a gradual and parallel change in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year.\nTable 39\nSENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES\n(Dollars in millions)\nCalculated Increase (Decrease)\nin Projected Net Interest Income \nChanges in interest rates\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n+200 basis points\n$\n(4)\n$\n(18)\n+100 basis points\n16 \n20 \n-100 basis points\n(36)\n(46)\n-200 basis points\n(81)\n(83)\nThe Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments, loan and deposit volumes, mix and pricing, and deposit maturities. Changes in amounts presented since December 31, 2023 reflect changes in portfolio composition (including purchases of investment securities, shifts between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposit products, lower levels of brokered time deposits and short-term borrowings and higher levels of long-term borrowings), the level of market-implied forward interest rates and hedging actions taken by the Company. M&T's cumulative upward deposit pricing beta, which is the change in deposit pricing in response to a change in market interest rates, approximated 55% amidst a rising interest rate environment from the first quarter of 2022 through the second quarter of 2024. Reflecting the first cuts of the federal funds target interest rate since March 2020, the FOMC decreased that rate by 50 basis points in September 2024 followed by additional reductions of 25 basis points in each of November and December of 2024. M&T's cumulative downward deposit pricing beta beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through December 31, 2024 approximated 45%. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in \n96\nmarket conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. \nManagement also uses an EVE model to supplement the modeling technique described above and provide a long-term interest rate risk metric. EVE is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of existing assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE reflects the present value of cash flows from existing assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments, but does not incorporate any assumptions for future originations, renewals or issuances. Management measures the impact of changes in market values due to interest rates under a number of scenarios, including immediate shifts of the yield curve. The percentage impact to the EVE resulting from a 100 basis-point increase and a 100 basis-point decrease in market interest rates was -5.1% and 2.5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, and -1.9% and -.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\nIn addition to the effect of interest rates, changes in fair value of the Company’s financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets. Information about the fair valuation of financial instruments is presented in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nThe Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts to meet the financial needs of customers that it includes in its consolidated financial statements as other non-hedging derivatives within other assets and other liabilities. Financial instruments utilized for such activities consist predominantly of interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies. The Company generally mitigates the interest rate and foreign currency risk associated with customer activities by entering into offsetting positions with third parties that are also included in other assets and other liabilities. The fair values of non-hedging derivative positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. As with any non-government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to its non-hedging derivative activities. Although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the unsettled fair values of such financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair values of such non-hedging derivative assets and liabilities recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $206 million and $787 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and $256 million and $898 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The fair value of asset and liability amounts at December 31, 2024 have been reduced by contractual settlements of $686 million and $15 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2023 have been reduced by contractual settlements of $783 million and $32 million, respectively. The amounts associated with the Company's non-hedging derivative activities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 reflect changes in values associated with the interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments.\nTrading account assets were $101 million at December 31, 2024 and $106 million at December 31, 2023. Included in trading account assets were assets related to deferred compensation plans aggregating $22 million at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Changes in the fair values of such assets are recorded as Trading account and other non-hedging derivative gains in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Included in Accrued interest and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $27 million of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recognized in Other \n97\ncosts of operations in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Also included in trading account assets were investments in mutual funds and other assets that the Company was required to hold under terms of certain non-qualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans that were assumed by the Company in various acquisitions. Those assets totaled $79 million at December 31, 2024 and $80 million at December 31, 2023.\nGiven the Company’s policies and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading account and other non-hedging derivative activities was not material at December 31, 2024, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to such activities. Information about the Company’s use of derivative financial instruments is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. \nCapital\nThe following table presents components related to shareholders' equity and dividends. \nTable 41\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, DIVIDENDS AND SELECT RATIOS\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in millions, except per share)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPreferred stock\n$\n2,394 \n$\n2,011 \n$\n2,011 \nCommon shareholders' equity\n26,633 \n24,946 \n23,307 \nTotal shareholders' equity\n$\n29,027 \n$\n26,957 \n$\n25,318 \nPer share:\nCommon shareholders’ equity\n$\n160.90 \n$\n150.15 \n$\n137.68 \nTangible common shareholders’ equity (a)\n109.36 \n98.54 \n86.59 \nRatios:\nShareholders' equity to total assets\n13.95 \n%\n12.94 \n%\n12.61 \n%\nTangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets (a)\n9.07 \n8.20 \n7.63 \nCash dividends declared for year ended:\nCommon stock\n$\n899 \n$\n871 \n$\n787 \nCommon stock per share\n5.35 \n5.20 \n4.80 \nCommon share dividend payout ratio\n36.63 \n%\n32.97 \n%\n41.56 \n%\nPreferred stock\n$\n134 \n$\n100 \n$\n97 \n__________________________________________________________________________________ \n(a)\nReconciliations of common shareholders’ equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are presented in Table 3.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the ratio of average total shareholders’ equity to average total assets was 13.28%, 12.61% and 12.51%, respectively.

Information concerning the Company’s fair valuations of investment securities is provided in notes 3 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. As also described in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements, the Company does not expect any material credit-related losses with respect to its investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2024.\nPursuant to previously approved capital plans and authorizations by M&T's Board of Directors, M&T repurchased 2,148,042 shares of its common stock for a total cost of $400 million, including the share repurchase excise tax, in 2024. M&T repurchased 3,838,157 shares of its common stock for a total cost of $600 million, including the share repurchase excise tax, in 2023 and 10,453,282 shares of its common stock for $1.8 billion in 2022. On January 22, 2025, M&T's Board of Directors authorized a program under which $4.0 billion of common shares may be repurchased. That authorization replaced and terminated the previous authorized share repurchase program effective as of the same date. Discretion as to the amount and timing of authorized share repurchases in a given period has been delegated, through the authorization of the Board of Directors, to management and can be influenced by capital and liquidity requirements, including funding of future loan growth and other balance sheet management activities, as well as market and economic conditions.\nM&T and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable Capital Rules including retention of minimum risk-based capital ratios by M&T and its bank subsidiaries. Capital Rules also require buffers in addition to those minimum risk-based capital ratios. M&T is subject to a SCB requirement that is determined through the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress tests and M&T’s bank subsidiaries are subject to a 2.5% capital conservation buffer requirement. The buffer requirement must be composed entirely of CET1 capital. In June 2024, the Federal Reserve released the results of its most recent supervisory stress tests. Based on those results, on October 1, 2024, M&T's SCB of 3.8% became effective. The regulatory capital amounts and ratios of M&T and its bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 are presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. A detailed discussion of the Capital Rules is included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Capital Requirements.\"\n99\nCapital Rules generally require the deduction of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred taxes, from the calculation of capital in the determination of the minimum capital ratios. As a result of previous business acquisitions, the Company recorded goodwill of $8.5 billion and core deposit and other intangible assets of $94 million at December 31, 2024. Goodwill, as required by GAAP, is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually at the business reporting unit level. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2024 and concluded the amount of goodwill was not impaired at the testing date. The Company has not identified events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a business reporting unit below its carrying amount at December 31, 2024. Should a business reporting unit with assigned goodwill experience declines in revenue, increased credit losses or expenses, or other adverse developments due to economic, regulatory, competition or other factors, that would be material to that reporting unit, an impairment of goodwill could occur in a future period that could be material to the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and its Consolidated Statement of Income. Although a goodwill impairment charge would not have a significant impact on the Company's regulatory tangible capital ratios, it would reduce the capacity of its bank subsidiary, M&T Bank, to dividend earnings to M&T. As described herein under the heading \"Liquidity Risk,\" M&T's parent company liquidity at December 31, 2024, inclusive of the projected repayment of notes receivables from bank subsidiaries, covered projected cash outflows for 44 months, including dividends on common and preferred stock, debt service and scheduled debt maturities. Information concerning goodwill and other intangible assets is included in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nThe Company is subject to the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs and FHCs and their subsidiaries, which includes examinations by a number of regulators. Regulation of financial institutions such as M&T and its subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the DIF of the FDIC and the banking and financial system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders, investors or creditors other than insured depositors. Changes in laws, regulations and regulatory policies applicable to the Company’s operations can increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive environment in which the Company operates, all of which could have a material effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and on M&T’s ability to pay dividends. For additional information concerning this comprehensive regulatory framework, refer to Part I, Item 1, \"Supervision and Regulation of the Company\" of this Form 10-K. \nAs described in Part I, Item 1, \"Capital Requirements\" of this Form 10-K, on July 27, 2023 the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the regulatory capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations with total assets exceeding $100 billion, like the Company. Management continues to evaluate the impact of the proposed rules on the regulatory capital requirements of M&T and its subsidiary banks. At December 31, 2024, the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) components related to investment securities available for sale and defined benefit plan liability adjustments would have reduced the Company's CET1 capital ratio by 4 basis points.\nSegment Information\nReportable segments have been determined based upon the Company’s organizational structure which is primarily arranged around the delivery of products and services to similar customer types. The reportable segments are Commercial Bank, Retail Bank, and Institutional Services and Wealth Management. All other business activities that are not included in the three reportable segment results have been included in the \"All Other\" category.\n100\nA description of the business activities conducted by each of the Company's segments and the accounting policies utilized in compiling financial information of such segments is provided in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data.\nTable 43\nNET INCOME (LOSS) BY SEGMENT\nChange

In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Company’s reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. The more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following:\nAccounting for credit losses \nThe allowance for credit losses represents a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of certain financial assets, including loans and leases, to present the net amount expected to be collected at the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio, borrower-specific financial data and macroeconomic assumptions are utilized to project losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. For certain loan pools that share similar risk characteristics, the Company utilizes statistically developed models to estimate amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay obligations. Such models consider historical correlations of credit losses with various macroeconomic assumptions including unemployment, GDP and real estate prices. Subsequent to the forecast period, the Company utilizes longer-term historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining contractual life of the loans. These forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases of the models as well as for other factors that may not be adequately considered in the Company’s quantitative methodologies. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining management’s estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which could result in adjustment of the allowance for credit losses in future periods. A discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in determining the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading \"Provision for Credit Losses\" and in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. \nValuation methodologies\nManagement of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as investment securities and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations, capitalized servicing assets, pension benefit obligations and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. In addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Examples include certain investments, capitalized servicing assets, goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, among others. Specific assumptions and \n106\nestimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and in notes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, 17 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nCommitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements\nInformation regarding the Company’s commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Company’s results of operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. Information regarding the Company’s income taxes is presented in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Developments \nA discussion of recent accounting developments is included in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements.\nForward-Looking Statements\n\"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and other sections of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement, including statements based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company’s business, and management’s beliefs and assumptions. \nStatements regarding the potential effects of events or factors specific to the Company and/or the financial industry as a whole, as well as national and global events generally, on the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond the Company’s control. \nForward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"target,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" or \"potential,\" by future conditional verbs such as \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" or \"may,\" or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict and may cause actual outcomes to differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted. \nWhile there can be no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties is complete, important factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation, as well as the risks more fully discussed in Part I,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K: economic conditions and growth rates, including inflation and market volatility; events and developments in the financial services industry, including industry conditions; changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, loan concentrations by type and industry, credit losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans, and other assets; sources of liquidity; levels of client deposits; ability to contain costs and expenses; changes in the Company’s credit ratings; domestic or international political developments \n107\nand other geopolitical events, including international conflicts and hostilities; changes and trends in the securities markets; common shares outstanding and common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods; the impact of changes in market values on trust-related revenues; federal, state or local legislation and/or regulations affecting the financial services industry, or M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively, including tax policy; regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements; governmental and public policy changes; political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T and its subsidiaries do business; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related examinations and other matters; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB, regulatory agencies or legislation; increasing price, product and service competition by competitors, including new entrants; technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix of products and services; protection and validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support M&T and its subsidiaries' future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition, divestment and investment activities compared with M&T's initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements.\nThese are representative of the factors that could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, as noted, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T and its subsidiaries do business, and other factors. Further details regarding such factors, risks and uncertainties related to the Company are described in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Form 10-K.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company assumes no duty and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements.\n108\nTable 48\nQUARTERLY TRENDS\n2024 Quarters\n2023 Quarters\n(Dollars in millions,

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria described in \"Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. \nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, that was engaged to express an opinion as to the fairness of presentation of such financial statements. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was also engaged to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP follows this report.\nM&T BANK CORPORATION\nRené F. Jones\nChairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nDaryl N. Bible\nSenior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n112\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of M&T Bank Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of M&T Bank Corporation and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\").\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n113\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Adjustments to model forecasts\nAs described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for credit losses of $2.2 billion reflects management's expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio of $135.6 billion as of December 31, 2024. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, management evaluates the Company’s loan and lease portfolio by type. Management utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and to determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. Model forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases that have been identified through independent validation and back-testing of model performance to actual realized results. Management may adjust forecasted loss estimates for inherent limitations or biases in the models as well as for other factors that may not be adequately considered in its quantitative methodologies including the impact of portfolio concentrations, imprecision in its economic forecasts, geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that might influence its loss estimation process. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for credit losses, specifically certain adjustments to model forecasts, is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the adjustments to model forecasts, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence related to management’s determination of these adjustments to \n114\nmodel forecasts, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s allowance for credit losses estimation process, including controls relating to the allowance for credit losses estimation process for certain adjustments to model forecasts. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for determining the allowance for credit losses and these adjustments to model forecasts, including evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodology, testing the data utilized by management and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions relating to these adjustments to model forecasts. Evaluating significant assumptions relating to these adjustments to model forecasts involved evaluating portfolio composition and concentration, as well as relevant market data. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodology and the reasonableness of significant assumptions relating to these adjustments to model forecasts.\nBuffalo, New York\nFebruary 19, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1984.\n115\nM&T BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Balance

York. Through subsidiaries, M&T provides individuals, corporations and other businesses, and institutions with commercial and retail banking services, including loans and deposits, mortgage banking, trust, asset management and other financial services. Banking activities are largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia and on small and medium-size businesses based in those areas. Certain subsidiaries also conduct activities in other areas.\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \nThe Company's significant accounting policies are as follows:\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include M&T and all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions of consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements of M&T included in note 24 report investments in subsidiaries under the equity method. Information about some limited purpose entities that are affiliates of the Company but are not included in the consolidated financial statements appears in note 18.\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nFor purposes of this statement, cash and due from banks and federal funds sold are considered cash and cash equivalents.\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged. It is generally the Company’s policy to take possession of collateral pledged to secure agreements to resell.\nTrading account\nFinancial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at fair value. Realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in fair value of financial instruments utilized in trading activities are included in Trading account and other non-hedging derivative gains in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nInvestment securities\nInvestments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and stated at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity. Investments in other debt securities are classified as available for sale and stated at estimated fair value with unrealized changes in fair value included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net, in \n121\nthe Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for investment securities available for sale and held to maturity are included in interest income.\nInvestments in equity securities having readily determinable fair values are stated at fair value and unrealized changes in fair value are included in earnings. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Other equity securities include stock of the FRB of New York and the FHLB of New York.\nGAAP requires an allowance for credit losses be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets, including investment securities held to maturity, to present the net carrying value at the amount that is expected to be collected over the contractual term. In cases where fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is less than its amortized cost basis and the Company does not intend to sell the available-for-sale debt security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost basis is separated into (a) the amount representing the credit loss and (b) the amount related to all other factors. The amount related to the credit loss is recognized as an allowance for credit losses while the amount related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not to be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the security is written down to fair value with the entire amount recognized in earnings. Subsequently, the Company accounts for the debt security as if the security had been purchased on the measurement date of the write down at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the amount of the write down recognized in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sales of investment securities are determined using the specific identification method.\nLoans and leases\nThe Company’s accounting methods for loans depend on whether the loans were originated or acquired by the Company.\nOriginated loans and leases\nLoan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized as an interest yield adjustment over the life of the loan. Interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and previously accrued interest thereon is charged against income when the Company expects it will be unable to collect all amounts owed under the terms of the loan agreement or when principal or interest is delinquent 90 days. Certain loans greater than 90 days delinquent continue to accrue interest if they are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have an insignificant delay in payment and generally continue to accrue interest. Interest received on loans placed on nonaccrual status is generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan or, if principal is considered fully collectable, recognized as interest income. Nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans are returned to accrual status when borrowers have demonstrated an ability to repay their loans and there are no delinquent principal and interest payments. Residential real estate loans and consumer loans are returned to accrual status when all past due principal and interest payments have been paid by the borrower. Loan balances are charged-off when it becomes evident that such balances are not fully collectable. For commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans, charge-offs are recognized after an assessment by credit personnel of the capacity and willingness of the borrower to repay, the estimated value of any collateral, and any other potential sources of repayment. A charge-off is recognized when, after such assessment, it becomes evident that the loan balance is not fully collectable. For loans secured by residential real \n122\nestate, the excess of the loan balances over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days delinquent. Consumer loans are generally charged-off when the loans are 91 to 180 days past due, depending on whether the loan is collateralized and the status of repossession activities with respect to such collateral.\nDuring the normal course of business, the Company modifies loans to maximize recovery efforts from borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Such loan modifications typically include extensions of maturity dates but may also include other modified terms. Those modified loans may be considered nonaccrual if the Company does not expect to collect the contractual cash flows owed under the loan agreement. On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted amended guidance that eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings while expanding disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The amended guidance also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. Prior to January 1, 2023, if the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty such that the Company did not expect to collect the contractual cash flows owed under the original loan agreement and a concession in loan terms was granted, the Company considered the loan modification as a troubled debt restructuring and such loans were designated as either nonaccrual or renegotiated loans. \nCommitments to sell real estate loans are utilized by the Company to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real estate loans held for sale. The carrying value of hedged real estate loans held for sale recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes changes in estimated fair value during the hedge period, typically from the date of close through the sale date. Valuation adjustments made on these loans and commitments are included in Mortgage banking revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \nAcquired loans and leases\nExpected credit losses for PCD loans are initially recognized as an allowance for credit losses and are added to the purchase price to determine the amortized cost basis of the loans. Any non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring such loans is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining lives of the loans. Subsequent changes in the amount of expected credit losses on such loans are recognized in the allowance for credit losses in the same manner as originated loans. For all other acquired loans, the difference between the fair value and outstanding principal balance of the loans is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the lives of those loans. Those loans are then accounted for in a manner that is similar to originated loans.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value at the amount that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the asset considering relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. In estimating expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio, borrower-specific financial data and macroeconomic assumptions are utilized to project losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. Assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers’ abilities to repay obligations. Subsequent to the forecast period, the Company utilizes longer-term historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining contractual life of the loans.\nAssets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans\nAssets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans are primarily comprised of commercial and residential real property and are included in Accrued interest and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n123\nAn in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of real estate property collateralizing a mortgage loan upon either (i) the creditor obtaining legal title to the real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (ii) the borrower conveying all interest in the real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. Upon acquisition of assets taken in satisfaction of a defaulted loan, the excess of the remaining loan balance over the asset’s estimated fair value less costs to sell is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent declines in value of the assets are recognized as Other costs of operations in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nPremises and equipment\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Right-of-use assets related to operating lease arrangements for various facilities and other assets with an original term greater than 12 months are included in Premises and equipment and the corresponding lease liabilities are included in Accrued interest and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCapitalized servicing rights\nCapitalized servicing assets are included in Accrued interest and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Separately recognized servicing assets are initially measured at fair value. The Company uses the amortization method to subsequently measure servicing assets. Under that method, capitalized servicing assets are charged to expense in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income.\nTo estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company considers market prices for similar assets and the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing rights calculated using assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future servicing income and expense. Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing loans, loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate, and prepayment speeds. For purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing rights, the Company stratifies such assets based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying financial instruments that are expected to have the most impact on projected prepayments, cost of servicing and other factors affecting future cash flows associated with the servicing rights. Such factors may include financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds estimated fair value. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance.\nSales and securitizations of financial assets\nTransfers of financial assets for which the Company has surrendered control of the financial assets are accounted for as sales. Interests in a sale of financial assets that continue to be held by the Company, including servicing rights, are initially measured at fair value. The fair values of retained debt securities are generally determined through reference to independent pricing information. The fair values of retained servicing rights and any other retained interests are determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with those interests and by reference to market prices for similar assets.\nSecuritization structures and other financial vehicles oftentimes require the use of special-purpose trusts that are considered variable interest entities. A variable interest entity is included in the consolidated financial statements if the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to \n124\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. The recognition or de-recognition in the Company’s consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the relative significance of the Company’s financial interests in those entities and the degree to which the Company can influence the most important activities of the entities.\nGoodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, which is either at the same level or one level below an operating segment. Other acquired intangible assets with finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, are initially recorded at estimated fair value and are amortized over their estimated lives. Core deposit and other intangible assets are generally amortized using accelerated methods over estimated useful lives, which are generally \nthree\n to \nseven years\n. The Company periodically assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of core deposit and other intangible assets may be impaired.\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Company accounts for derivative financial instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (i) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (ii) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or (iii) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available-for-sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction.\nThe Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For such agreements, amounts receivable or payable are recognized as accrued under the terms of the agreement and the net differential is recorded as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related asset or liability. Interest rate swap agreements may be designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair values recognized in earnings of interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In a cash flow hedge, the derivative’s unrealized gain or loss is initially recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. \nThe Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans held for sale. Commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans are generally recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at estimated fair value. Valuation adjustments made on these commitments are included in Mortgage banking revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nDerivative instruments not related to mortgage banking activities, including financial futures commitments and interest rate swap agreements, that do not satisfy the hedge accounting requirements are recorded at fair value and are generally classified as other assets or other liabilities with resultant changes in fair value being recognized in Trading account and other non-hedging derivative gains in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n125\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nA significant amount of the Company’s revenues are derived from net interest income on financial assets and liabilities, mortgage banking revenues, trading account and other non-hedging derivative gains, investment securities gains, loan and letter of credit fees, income from bank-owned life insurance, and certain other revenues that are generally excluded from the scope of accounting guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. For other noninterest income revenue streams, the Company generally recognizes the expected amount of consideration as revenue when the performance obligations related to the services under the terms of a contract are satisfied. The Company’s contracts generally do not contain terms that necessitate significant judgment to determine the amount of revenue to recognize.\nService charges on deposit accounts\n include fees deducted directly from customer account balances, such as account maintenance, insufficient funds and other transactional service charges, and also include debit card interchange revenue resulting from customer initiated transactions. Account maintenance charges are generally recognized as revenue on a monthly basis, whereas other fees are recognized after the respective service is provided.\nTrust income\n includes revenues from a variety of trustee, agency, investment, cash management and administrative services, asset management, fiduciary services, and family office services. Trust fees may be billed in arrears or in advance and are recognized as revenue as the Company’s performance obligations are satisfied. Certain fees are based on a percentage of assets invested or under management and are recognized as the service is performed and constraints regarding the uncertainty of the amount of fees are resolved.\nBrokerage services\n \nincome\n includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees. Such revenues are generally recognized at the time of transaction execution. Mutual fund and other distribution fees are recognized upon initial placement of customer funds as well as in future periods as such customers continue to hold amounts in those mutual funds.\nOther revenues from operations\n include merchant discount and credit card interchange fees that are generally recognized when the cardholder’s transaction is approved and settled. Also included in other revenues from operations are insurance commissions, ATM surcharge fees, and advisory and other fees. Insurance commissions are recognized at the time the insurance policy is executed with the customer. Insurance renewal commissions are recognized upon subsequent renewal of the policy. ATM surcharge fees are included in revenue at the time of the respective ATM transaction. Advisory and other fees are generally recognized when the Company has satisfied its service obligation.\nStock-based compensation\nCompensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of stock-based awards based on estimated grant date value, except that the recognition of compensation costs is accelerated for stock-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees and employees who will become retirement-eligible prior to full vesting of the award because the Company’s incentive compensation plan allows for vesting at the time an employee retires. The Company may issue shares from treasury stock to the extent available or issue new shares to satisfy its obligations with respect to stock-based compensation awards.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects attributable to differences between the financial statement value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws.\nThe Company evaluates uncertain tax positions using the two-step process required by GAAP. The first step requires a determination of whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based \n126\non the technical merits of the position. Under the second step, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nThe Company accounts for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method. Under that method, the Company amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company adopted amended guidance which permits an election to account for other tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. The Company has elected to apply the proportional amortization method to eligible renewable energy and certain other tax credit investments in addition to the low income housing tax credit investments for which the proportional amortization method had previously been applied.\n \nEarnings per common share\nBasic earnings per common share exclude dilution and are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (exclusive of shares represented by the unvested portion of restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants) and common shares issuable under deferred compensation arrangements during the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflect shares represented by the unvested portion of restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants and the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings. Proceeds assumed to have been received on such exercise or conversion are assumed to be used to purchase shares of M&T common stock at the average market price during the period, as required by the \"treasury stock method\" of accounting.\nGAAP requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) be considered participating securities and be included in the computation of earnings per common share pursuant to the two-class method. The Company has issued stock-based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units that contain such rights and, accordingly, the Company’s earnings per common share are calculated using the two-class method.\nTreasury stock\nRepurchases of shares of M&T common stock are recorded at cost as a reduction of shareholders’ equity. Reissuances of shares of treasury stock are recorded at average cost.\n127\nRecent accounting developments\nThe following table provides a description of accounting standards that were adopted by the Company in 2024. Standards applicable to M&T but not yet adopted at December 31, 2024 primarily address enhanced disclosure requirements for income taxes and the disaggregated income statement presentation of certain expenses and are not expected to have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n \nStandard\nDescription\nRequired date of adoption\nEffect on consolidated financial statements\n \n \nAccounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method\nThe amendments permit an election to account for tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met.\nUnder the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits are recognized in the income statement as a component of income tax expense.\nJanuary 1, 2024\nAs described in note 18, the Company adopted the amended guidance effective January 1, 2024 using a modified retrospective transition. The guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n \nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nThe amendments require increased segment disclosures inclusive of significant expense categories and financial information that is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.\nDecember 31, 2024 and interim periods thereafter\nThe Company has included the enhanced disclosures required by the amended guidance in note 21.\n2.\nAcquisition and divestitures\nAcquisition\nOn April 1, 2022, M&T completed the acquisition of People's United. Through subsidiaries, People's United provided commercial banking, retail banking and wealth management services to individual, corporate and municipal customers through a network of branches located in Connecticut, southeastern New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Following the merger, People's United Bank, National Association, a national banking association and a wholly owned subsidiary of People's United, merged with and into M&T Bank, the principal banking subsidiary of M&T, with M&T Bank as the surviving entity. The results of operations acquired from People's United have been included in the Company's financial results since April 1, 2022.\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, People’s United shareholders received consideration valued at \n.118\n of an M&T common share in exchange for each common share of People’s United. The purchase price totaled approximately $\n8.4\n billion (with the price based on M&T’s closing price of $\n164.66\n per share as of April 1, 2022). M&T issued \n50,325,004\n common shares in completing the transaction. Additionally, People’s United outstanding preferred stock was converted into new shares of Series H Perpetual Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock. The acquisition of People's United expanded the Company's geographical footprint and management expects the Company will benefit from greater geographical diversity and the advantages of scale associated with a larger company.\nThe People’s United transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and preferred stock converted were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. \nThe consideration paid for People’s United common equity and the amounts of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and preferred stock converted as of the acquisition date follows.\n128\n(Dollars in millions)\nConsideration:\nCommon stock issued (\n50,325,004\n shares)\n$\n8,286\n \nCommon stock awards converted\n105\n \nCash\n2\n \nTotal consideration\n8,393\n \nNet assets acquired:\nIdentifiable assets:\nCash and due from banks\n396\n \nInterest-bearing deposits at banks\n9,193\n \nInvestment securities\n11,575\n \nLoans and leases\n35,841\n \nCore deposit and other intangible assets\n261\n \nOther assets\n2,979\n \nTotal identifiable assets acquired\n60,245\n \nLiabilities and preferred stock:\nDeposits\n52,968\n \nBorrowings\n1,389\n \nOther liabilities\n1,142\n \nTotal liabilities assumed\n55,499\n \nPreferred stock\n261\n \nTotal liabilities and preferred stock\n55,760\n \nNet assets acquired\n4,485\n \nGoodwill\n$\n3,908\n \nThe following is a description of the methodologies used to estimate the fair values of the significant assets acquired, liabilities assumed and preferred stock converted at the acquisition date:\nCash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits at banks:\n Given the short-term nature of these assets, the carrying amount was determined to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nInvestment securities:\n Investment securities have been determined using quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market prices were not available, investment securities were valued by reference to quoted prices for similar securities or through model-based techniques.\nLoans and leases:\n The fair values of loans and leases were generally based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered market interest rates, expected credit losses, prepayment assumptions and other market factors for loans with similar characteristics including loan type, collateral, fixed or variable interest rate and credit risk characteristics. Expected credit losses were determined based on credit characteristics and other factors such as default and recovery rates of similar products.\nCore deposit and other intangible assets:\n The core deposit intangible asset represents the value of certain customer deposit relationships. The fair value of the core deposit intangible asset was based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered expected customer attrition rates, costs associated with maintaining the deposit relationships and alternative funding costs. Other intangible assets were also valued using expected and contractual cash flows.\nDeposits:\n The fair value of deposits with no maturity date was determined to be the amount payable on demand at the acquisition date. The fair value of time deposits was determined by \n129\ndiscounting contractual cash flows using market interest rates for instruments with like remaining maturities.\nBorrowings:\n The fair value of borrowings was determined using quoted market prices for the instrument, if available. If quoted market prices for the instrument were not available, similar instruments with quoted market prices were referenced.\nPreferred stock:\n The fair value of preferred stock converted was determined using quoted market prices.\nGAAP requires loans and leases obtained through an acquisition that have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination be considered PCD. The Company considered several factors in the determination of PCD loans, including loan grades assigned to acquired commercial and industrial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans utilizing the Company's loan grading system and delinquency status and history for acquired loans backed by residential real estate. For PCD loans and leases, the initial estimate of expected credit losses of $\n99\n million was established through an adjustment to increase both the initial carrying value and the allowance for credit losses. GAAP also provides that an allowance for credit losses on loans acquired, but not classified as PCD, also be recognized above and beyond the impact of forecasted losses used in determining fair value. Accordingly, the Company recorded $\n242\n million of provision for credit losses for non-PCD acquired loans and leases at the acquisition date. \nThe following table reconciles the unpaid principal balance to the fair value of loans and leases at April 1, 2022:\n(Dollars in millions)\nPCD\n \nNon-PCD\n \nUnpaid principal balance\n$\n3,411\n \n(a)\n$\n32,896\n \nAllowance for credit losses at acquisition\n(\n99\n)\n(a)\n— \nOther discount\n(\n107\n)\n(\n260\n)\n(b)\nFair value\n$\n3,205\n \n$\n32,636\n \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nThe unpaid principal balance and allowance for credit losses at acquisition is net of charge-offs of $\n33\n million recognized on the PCD loans.\n(b)\nIncludes approximately $\n242\n million of principal balances not expected to be collected.\nDue to the integration of People's United operating systems and activities with those of the Company, the Company's ability to report on the former operations of People's United is inherently limited. The Company estimates that included in the Consolidated Statement of Income from the acquisition date through December 31, 2022 are total revenues of approximately $\n1.6\n billion and net income of approximately $\n165\n million related to the acquisition of People's United.\nThe following table presents certain pro forma information as if People’s United had been acquired on January 1, 2021. These results combine the historical results of People’s United into the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income and, while adjustments were made for the estimated impact of certain fair valuation adjustments and other acquisition-related activity, they are not indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition taken place as indicated. For example, merger-related expenses noted below are included in the periods where such expenses were incurred. \nAdditionally, the Company expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies as a result of the acquisition which are not reflected in the pro forma amounts that follow:\nPro forma (Unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions)\n2022\nTotal revenues (a)\n$\n8,631\n \nNet income\n2,158\n \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nRepresents the total of net interest income and other income.\n130\nIn connection with the People’s United acquisition, the Company incurred merger-related expenses related to systems conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming acquired operations with and into the Company. Those expenses consisted largely of professional services, temporary help fees and other costs associated with systems conversions and/or integration of operations and the introduction of the Company to its new customers; costs related to termination of existing contractual arrangements for various services; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T Bank to its new customers; severance (for former People’s United employees); and other costs of completing the transaction and commencing operations in new markets and offices. The Company did \nno\nt incur any People's United merger-related expenses during 2023 or 2024. \nA summary of merger-related expenses included in the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2022 follows.\n(Dollars in millions)\n2022\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$\n102\n \nEquipment and net occupancy\n7\n \nOutside data processing and software\n5\n \nProfessional and other services\n72\n \nAdvertising and marketing\n9\n \nOther cost of operations\n143\n \nOther expense\n$\n338\n \nThe Company also recognized a $\n242\n million provision for credit losses on acquired loans that were not deemed to be PCD on April 1, 2022. GAAP requires that acquired loans be recorded at estimated fair value, which includes the use of interest rate and expected credit loss assumptions to forecast estimated cash flows. GAAP also provides that an allowance for credit losses on loans acquired, but not classified as PCD also be recognized above and beyond the impact of forecasted losses used in determining the fair value of acquired loans. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $\n242\n million provision for credit losses related to such loans obtained in the People's United transaction.\nDivestitures\nOn April 29, 2023, Wilmington Trust, N.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of M&T, sold its CIT business to a private equity firm. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $\n225\n million ($\n157\n million after-tax effect) that has been included in Other revenues from operations in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023. Prior to the sale, the CIT business contributed $\n60\n million and $\n165\n million to trust income in 2023 and 2022, respectively. After considering expenses, the results of operations from the CIT business were not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations in either of those years.\nOn October 31, 2022, M&T Bank sold MTIA, a wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary of M&T Bank, to Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.

Loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible \"pass\" loan grades and are generally ascribed lower loss factors when determining the allowance for credit losses. Loans with an elevated level of credit risk are designated as \"criticized\" and are ascribed a higher loss factor when determining the allowance for credit losses. Criticized loans may be designated as \"nonaccrual\" if the Company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more.\nLine of business personnel in different geographic locations with support from and review by the Company’s credit risk personnel review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions. Factors considered in assigning loan grades include borrower-specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral values, geographic location, financial condition and performance, payment status, and other information. The Company’s policy is that, at least annually, updated financial information be obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis performed. On a quarterly basis, the Company’s credit personnel reviews criticized commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than $\n5\n million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade, including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing.\n137\nThe following table summarizes the loan grades applied at December 31, 2024 to the various

acquired loans recorded on April 1, 2022.\n(b)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net charge-offs do not reflect $\n33\n million of charge-offs related to PCD loans acquired on April 1, 2022.\n \nDespite the allocation in the preceding tables, the allowance for credit losses is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease type. In determining the allowance for credit losses, accruing loans with similar risk characteristics are generally evaluated collectively. The Company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and to determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. Individual loan credit quality indicators, including loan grade and borrower repayment performance, can inform the models, which have been statistically developed based on historical correlations of credit losses with prevailing economic metrics, including unemployment, GDP and real estate prices. Model forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases that have been identified through independent validation and back-testing of model \n142\nperformance to actual realized results. At each of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company utilized a reasonable and supportable forecast period of two years. Subsequent to this forecast period the Company reverted, ratably over a one-year period, to historical loss experience to inform its estimate of losses for the remaining contractual life of each portfolio. In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company may adjust forecasted loss estimates for inherent limitations or biases in the models as well as for other factors that may not be adequately considered in its quantitative methodologies including the impact of portfolio concentrations, imprecision in its economic forecasts, geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that might influence its loss estimation process.\nThe Company also estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes. The amounts of specific loss components in the Company’s loan and lease portfolios are determined through a loan-by-loan analysis of larger balance commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans that are in nonaccrual status. Such loss estimates are typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay. To the extent that those loans are collateral-dependent, they are evaluated based on the fair value of the loan’s collateral as estimated at or near the financial statement date. As the quality of a loan deteriorates to the point of designating the loan as \"criticized nonaccrual,\" the process of obtaining updated collateral valuation information is usually initiated, unless it is not considered warranted given factors such as the relative size of the loan, the characteristics of the collateral or the age of the last valuation. In those cases where current appraisals may not yet be available, prior appraisals are utilized with adjustments, as deemed necessary, for estimates of subsequent declines in values as determined by line of business and/or loan workout personnel. Those adjustments are reviewed and assessed for reasonableness by the Company’s credit risk personnel. Accordingly, for real estate collateral securing larger nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans, estimated collateral values are generally based on current appraisals and estimates of value. For non-real estate loans, collateral is assigned a discounted estimated liquidation value and, depending on the nature of the collateral, is verified through field exams or other procedures. In assessing collateral, real estate and non-real estate values are reduced by an estimate of selling costs. \nFor residential real estate loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes \n150\n days delinquent. That charge-off is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual. Loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged-off to estimated net collateral value shortly after the Company is notified of such filings. When evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge-off and for purposes of estimating losses in determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property. Other consumer loans are generally charged-off when the loans are 91 to 180 days past due, depending on whether the loan is collateralized and the status of repossession activities with respect to such collateral. \nChanges in the amount of the allowance for credit losses reflect the outcome of the procedures described herein, including the impact of changes in macroeconomic forecasts as compared with previous forecasts, as well as the impact of portfolio concentrations, imprecision in economic forecasts, geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that might influence the loss estimation process.\nThe Company's reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures was not material at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  \n143\nInformation with respect to loans and leases that were considered nonaccrual at the beginning and end of the reporting period and the interest income recognized on such loans for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 follows.\n \nAmortized Cost with Allowance\nAmortized Cost without Allowance\nTotal\nAmortized Cost\nInterest Income Recognized\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nJanuary 1, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n516\n \n$\n180\n \n$\n696\n \n$\n670\n \n$\n23\n \nReal estate:\n \n \n \n \nCommercial\n328\n \n140\n \n468\n \n869\n \n43\n \nResidential builder and developer\n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \n3\n \n1\n \nOther commercial construction\n60\n \n6\n \n66\n \n171\n \n4\n \nResidential\n137\n \n142\n \n279\n \n270\n \n15\n \nConsumer:\n \n \n \n \nHome equity lines and loans\n36\n \n45\n \n81\n \n81\n \n6\n \nRecreational finance\n21\n \n10\n \n31\n \n36\n \n—\n \nAutomobile\n9\n \n3\n \n12\n \n14\n \n—\n \nOther\n54\n \n1\n \n55\n \n52\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n1,163\n \n$\n527\n \n$\n1,690\n \n$\n2,166\n \n$\n92\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2023\nJanuary 1, 2023\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n397\n \n$\n273\n \n$\n670\n \n$\n504\n \n$\n22\n \nReal estate:\nCommercial\n288\n \n581\n \n869\n \n1,240\n \n29\n \nResidential builder and developer\n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \n1\n \n—\n \nOther commercial construction\n71\n \n100\n \n171\n \n125\n \n2\n \nResidential\n100\n \n170\n \n270\n \n350\n \n17\n \nConsumer:\n \n \n \n \nHome equity lines and loans\n42\n \n39\n \n81\n \n85\n \n7\n \nRecreational finance\n24\n \n12\n \n36\n \n45\n \n1\n \nAutomobile\n9\n \n5\n \n14\n \n40\n \n—\n \nOther\n52\n \n—\n \n52\n \n49\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n986\n \n$\n1,180\n \n$\n2,166\n \n$\n2,439\n \n$\n78\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2022\nJanuary 1, 2022\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n212\n \n$\n292\n \n$\n504\n \n$\n371\n \n$\n26\n \nReal estate:\nCommercial\n366\n \n874\n \n1,240\n \n919\n \n14\n \nResidential builder and developer\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n3\n \n2\n \nOther commercial construction\n59\n \n66\n \n125\n \n111\n \n4\n \nResidential\n195\n \n155\n \n350\n \n479\n \n26\n \nConsumer:\n \n \n \n \n \nHome equity lines and loans\n43\n \n42\n \n85\n \n70\n \n4\n \nRecreational finance\n37\n \n8\n \n45\n \n28\n \n1\n \nAutomobile\n35\n \n5\n \n40\n \n34\n \n—\n \nOther\n49\n \n—\n \n49\n \n45\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n997\n \n$\n1,442\n \n$\n2,439\n \n$\n2,060\n \n$\n77\n \n144\nLoan modifications\nDuring the normal course of business, the Company modifies loans to maximize recovery efforts from borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Such loan modifications typically include extensions of maturity dates but may also include other modified terms. Those modified loans may be considered nonaccrual if the Company does not expect to collect the contractual cash flows owed under the loan agreement. On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted amended guidance that eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings while expanding disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The amended guidance also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. \nThe table that follows summarizes the Company’s loan modification activities to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nAmortized Cost (a)\n(Dollars in millions)\nTerm Extension\nOther (b)\nCombination of Modification\nTypes (c)\nTotal (d) (e)\nPercent of Total Loan Class\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n212\n \n$\n84\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n303\n \n.49\n \n%\nReal estate:\n \n \n \nCommercial\n509\n \n2\n \n4\n \n515\n \n2.48\n \nResidential builder and developer\n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n.29\n \nOther commercial construction\n130\n \n—\n \n—\n \n130\n \n2.53\n \nResidential\n146\n \n14\n \n17\n \n177\n \n.76\n \nConsumer:\n \n \nHome equity lines and loans\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n2\n \n.04\n \nRecreational finance\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n.01\n \nAutomobile\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n1,001\n \n$\n100\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n1,130\n \n.83\n% \nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n169\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n198\n \n.35\n \n%\nReal estate:\nCommercial\n610\n \n—\n \n41\n \n651\n \n2.57\n \nResidential builder and developer\n69\n \n2\n \n—\n \n71\n \n6.63\n \nOther commercial construction\n480\n \n—\n \n8\n \n488\n \n7.34\n \nResidential\n148\n \n23\n \n6\n \n177\n \n.76\n \nConsumer:\nHome equity lines and loans\n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \n.03\n \nRecreational finance\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAutomobile\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n1,476\n \n$\n52\n \n$\n58\n \n$\n1,586\n \n1.18\n% \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nAs of the respective year end.\n(b)\nPrimarily payment deferrals or interest rate reductions.\n(c)\nPrimarily term extensions combined with interest rate reductions.\n(d)\nIncludes approximately $\n143\n million and $\n124\n million of loans guaranteed by government-related entities (primarily first lien residential mortgage loans) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(e)\nExcludes unfunded commitments to extend credit totaling $\n69\n million and $\n128\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n145\nThe financial effects of the modifications for the year ended December 31, 2024 include an increase in the weighted-average remaining term for commercial and industrial loans of \n0.9\n years, for commercial real estate loans, inclusive of residential builder and development loans and other commercial construction loans, of \n1.0\n years and for residential real estate loans of \n10.4\n years.

Those options are included in the lease term when it is determined that it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised. \nThe Company has noncancelable operating lease agreements for certain equipment related to ATMs, servers, printers and mail machines that are used in the normal course of operations. The ATM leases are either based on the rights to a specific square footage or a license agreement whereby the Company has the right to operate an ATM in a lessor's location. The lease terms generally contain both fixed payments and variable payments that are transaction-based. Given the transaction-based nature of the variable payments, such payments are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability and are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income as a component of Equipment and net occupancy expense when incurred. \nIn December 2024, M&T vacated certain floors of a leased office facility resulting in a write-down of the associated right-of-use asset and leasehold improvements of $\n12\n million. Also in December 2024, M&T fully vacated and listed for sale an owned office building. The building and associated leasehold improvements were written-down to fair value less cost to sell, resulting in a loss of $\n15\n million. These asset write-downs were recognized in Other costs of operations in the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2024.\n149\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s lease costs for operating leases recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, cash paid toward lease liabilities and the weighted-average remaining term and discount rates of the operating leases. \nYear Ended December 31, \n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nLease cost\nOperating lease cost\n$\n155\n \n$\n154\n \n$\n139\n \nShort-term lease cost\n—\n \n—\n \n8\n \nVariable lease cost\n5\n \n4\n \n4\n \nTotal lease cost\n$\n160\n \n$\n158\n \n$\n151\n \nOther information\nRight-of-use assets:\nObtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities\n$\n101\n \n$\n134\n \n$\n138\n \nAcquired in business combination\n—\n \n—\n \n226\n \nCash paid toward lease liabilities\n164\n \n158\n \n143\n \nWeighted-average remaining lease term\n7\n years\n7\n years\n7\n years\nWeighted-average discount rate\n3.64\n \n%\n3.37\n \n%\n2.97\n \n%\nMinimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases are summarized in the following table.\n(Dollars in millions)\nYear ending December 31:\n \n2025\n$\n160\n \n2026\n142\n \n2027\n120\n \n2028\n95\n \n2029\n70\n \nLater years\n182\n \nTotal lease payments\n769\n \nImputed interest\n(\n92\n)\nTotal\n$\n677\n \n150\n6.\nCapitalized servicing assets\nChanges in capitalized servicing assets were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nResidential Mortgage Loans\n \nCommercial Mortgage Loans\n \n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n456\n \n$\n194\n \n$\n241\n \n$\n123\n \n$\n126\n \n$\n133\n \nOriginations\n20\n \n13\n \n7\n \n34\n \n27\n \n24\n \nPurchases\n—\n \n350\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAcquired in business combination\n—\n \n—\n \n12\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAmortization\n(\n108\n)\n(\n101\n)\n(\n66\n)\n(\n31\n)\n(\n30\n)\n(\n31\n)\n368\n \n456\n \n194\n \n126\n \n123\n \n126\n \nValuation allowance\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEnding balance, net\n$\n368\n \n$\n456\n \n$\n194\n \n$\n126\n \n$\n123\n \n$\n126\n \nResidential Mortgage Loans\nCommercial Mortgage Loans\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nBalances at period end\nLoans serviced for others\n$\n38,105\n \n$\n40,021\n \n$\n27,474\n \n$\n24,157\n \nLoans sub-serviced for others\n111,544\n \n115,321\n \n4,063\n \n3,873\n \nTotal loans serviced for others\n$\n149,649\n \n$\n155,342\n \n$\n31,537\n \n$\n28,030\n \nDuring 2023, the Company completed a $\n350\n million bulk purchase of residential mortgage loan servicing rights associated with $\n19.5\n billion of residential real estate loans. In conjunction with the acquisition of People's United on April 1, 2022, the Company acquired servicing rights for residential real estate loans that had outstanding principal balances at that date of $\n1.1\n billion. The fair value of such servicing rights at that date was $\n12\n million. \nThe estimated fair value of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was approximately $\n612\n million at December 31, 2024 and $\n611\n million at December 31, 2023. The fair value of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was estimated using weighted-average discount rates of \n11.64\n% and \n11.45\n% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and contemporaneous prepayment assumptions that vary by loan type. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the discount rate represented a weighted-average OAS of \n758\n basis points and \n790\n basis points over market implied forward SOFR, respectively. The estimated fair value of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods due to changing interest rates and the effect thereof on prepayment speeds. The estimated fair value of capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets was approximately $\n194\n million at December 31, 2024 and $\n193\n million at December 31, 2023. Weighted-average discount rates of \n12.80\n% and \n14.43\n% were used to estimate the fair value of capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing rights at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Estimated servicing revenues and expenses used to value such servicing rights considered historical payment performance trends and current market interest rates. In general, the servicing agreements allow the Company to share in customer loan prepayment fees and thereby recover the remaining carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights associated with such loans. The Company's ability to realize the carrying value of capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing rights is more dependent on the borrowers' abilities to repay the underlying loans than it is on prepayments. \nThe key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of significant portfolios of capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2024 and the sensitivity of such value to changes in those assumptions are summarized in the table that follows. Those calculated sensitivities are \n151\nhypothetical and actual changes in the fair value of capitalized servicing rights may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. The effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the servicing rights is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The changes in assumptions are presumed to be instantaneous.\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nResidential\n \nCommercial\n \nWeighted-average prepayment speeds\n6.44\n \n%\nImpact on fair value of 10% adverse change\n$\n(\n14\n)\nImpact on fair value of 20% adverse change\n(\n28\n)\nWeighted-average OAS\n7.58\n \n%\nImpact on fair value of 10% adverse change\n$\n(\n17\n)\nImpact on fair value of 20% adverse change\n(\n33\n)\nWeighted-average discount rate\n12.80\n \n%\nImpact on fair value of 10% adverse change\n$\n(\n5\n)\nImpact on fair value of 20% adverse change\n(\n10\n)\n7.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nA summary of amortizing intangible assets follows. \n(Dollars in millions)\nGross Carrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet Carrying\nAmount\nDecember 31, 2024\nCore deposit\n$\n218\n \n$\n131\n \n$\n87\n \nOther\n43\n \n36\n \n7\n \nTotal\n$\n261\n \n$\n167\n \n$\n94\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nCore deposit\n$\n218\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n128\n \nOther\n43\n \n24\n \n19\n \nTotal\n$\n261\n \n$\n114\n \n$\n147\n \nEstimated amortization expense in future years for such intangible assets is as follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nYear ending December 31:\n2025\n$\n38\n \n2026\n27\n \n2027\n18\n \n2028\n9\n \n2029\n2\n \n$\n94\n \nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2024. For purposes of testing for impairment, the Company assigned all recorded goodwill to the reporting units originally intended to benefit from past business combinations, which has historically been the Company’s core relationship business reporting units. Goodwill was generally assigned based on the implied fair value of the acquired goodwill applicable to the benefited reporting units at the time of each respective acquisition. The implied fair value of the goodwill was determined as the difference between the estimated incremental overall fair value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value \n152\nof the net assets assigned to the reporting unit as of each respective acquisition date. To test for goodwill impairment at the evaluation date, the Company compared the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts and certain other assets and liabilities assigned to the reporting unit, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. The methodologies used to estimate fair values of reporting units as of the acquisition dates and as of the evaluation date were similar. For the Company’s core customer relationship business reporting units, fair value was estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows of the reporting unit. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test, the Company concluded that the amount of recorded goodwill was not impaired at the testing date. The Company was not aware of any events occurring in the fourth quarter of 2024 that more likely than \nno\nt would have resulted in an impairment of recorded goodwill at December 31, 2024.\nA summary of goodwill assigned to each of the Company’s reportable segments at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023 for purposes of testing for impairment is as follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nCommercial Bank\n$\n5,076\n \nRetail Bank\n3,089\n \nInstitutional Services and Wealth Management\n300\n \nAll Other\n—\n \nTotal\n$\n8,465\n \n8.\nBorrowings\nThe amounts and interest rates of short-term borrowings were as follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nRepurchase Agreements\n \nFHLB\nAdvances \nTotal\n \nAt December 31, 2024\nAmount outstanding\n$\n60\n \n$\n1,000\n \n$\n1,060\n \nWeighted-average interest rate\n2.65\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\n4.39\n \n%\nAt December 31, 2023\nAmount outstanding\n$\n316\n \n$\n5,000\n \n$\n5,316\n \nWeighted-average interest rate\n3.26\n \n%\n5.35\n \n%\n5.23\n \n%\nShort-term borrowings have a stated maturity of \none year\n or less at the date the Company enters into the obligation.

The proceeds from the issuances of the Preferred Capital Securities and the Common Securities were used by the trusts to purchase the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The Common Securities of each of those trusts are wholly owned by M&T and are the only class of each trust’s securities possessing general voting powers. The Preferred Capital Securities represent preferred undivided interests in the assets of the corresponding trust. Under the Federal Reserve’s risk-based capital guidelines, the Preferred Capital Securities qualify for inclusion in Tier 2 regulatory capital. Holders of the Preferred Capital Securities receive preferential cumulative cash distributions unless M&T exercises its right to extend the payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures as allowed by the terms of each such debenture, in which case payment of distributions on the respective Preferred Capital Securities will be deferred for comparable periods. During an extended interest period, M&T may not pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or acquire any shares of its capital stock. In general, the agreements governing the Preferred Capital Securities, in the aggregate, provide a full, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee by M&T of the payment of distributions on, the redemption of, and any liquidation distribution with respect to the Preferred Capital Securities. The obligations under such guarantee and the Preferred Capital Securities are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of M&T. In December 2024, the Company redeemed $\n130\n million par value of Junior Subordinated Debentures prior to their stated maturity dates. The early redemptions resulted in a loss of $\n20\n million, which was recognized in Other costs of operations in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \nAsset-backed notes represent the senior-most notes issued in securitization transactions that are secured by equipment finance loans and leases and automobile loans which were sold into special purpose trusts. Further information concerning these asset securitizations and the amounts of loans collateralizing the asset-back notes is included in note 4 and note 18, respectively. \n154\nLong-term borrowings at December 31, 2024 mature as follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nYear ending December 31: \n2025\n$\n3,270\n \n2026\n1,299\n \n2027\n788\n \n2028\n1,680\n \n2029\n1,575\n \nLater years\n3,993\n \n$\n12,605\n \n9.\nShareholders’ equity\nM&T is authorized to issue \n20,000,000\n shares of preferred stock with a $\n1.00\n par value per share.

As of December 31, 2024, there were \n1,871,663\n shares available for issuance under the plan. In connection with the employee stock purchase plan, shares of M&T common stock issued were \n100,964\n in 2024, \n90,575\n in 2023 and \n75,232\n in 2022. M&T received cash for shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan of $\n13\n million in each of 2024 and 2023 and $\n11\n million in 2022. \nDeferred bonus plan\nThe Company provided a deferred bonus plan pursuant to which eligible employees could elect to defer all or a portion of their annual incentive compensation awards and allocate such awards to several investment options, including M&T common stock. The deferred bonus plan was frozen \n157\neffective January 1, 2010 and did not allow any additional deferrals after that date. Participants could elect the timing of distributions from the plan. Such distributions are payable in cash with the exception of balances allocated to M&T common stock which are distributable in the form of M&T common stock. Shares of M&T common stock distributable pursuant to the terms of the deferred bonus plan were \n9,831\n and \n10,238\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The obligation to issue shares is included in Common stock issuable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nDirectors’ stock compensation programs\nThe Company maintains compensation programs for members of the Company’s boards of directors and its regional director advisory councils that provides for a portion of their compensation to be received in shares or restricted stock units. In 2024 and 2023, \n22,990\n and \n27,027\n shares, respectively, were granted under such programs.\nThrough acquisitions, the Company assumed obligations to issue shares of M&T common stock related to deferred directors' compensation plans. Shares of common stock issuable under such plans were \n1,811\n and \n1,979\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation included in the preceding data related to such plan were $\n132\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n146\n million as of December 31, 2023. The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n2.0\n billion at December 31, 2024 and $\n2.4\n billion at December 31, 2023. \nGAAP requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. \n159\nGains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not included as components of net periodic benefit expense, are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. Amortization of net gains and losses is included in annual net periodic benefit expense if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related fair value of the plan assets. The net gain in 2024 was mainly the result of a return on plan assets that was greater than the assumed expected return and an increase to the assumed discount rate used to value plan liabilities. \nThe table below reflects the changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income related to the Company’s postretirement benefit plans.\n(Dollars in millions)\nPension Plans\n \nOther\nPostretirement\nBenefit Plans \nTotal\n \n2024\nNet gain\n$\n(\n298\n)\n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n(\n305\n)\nAmortization of prior service credit\n—\n \n2\n \n2\n \nAmortization of actuarial gain\n2\n \n3\n \n5\n \nSettlement gain\n12\n \n—\n \n12\n \nTotal recognized in other comprehensive income, pre-tax\n$\n(\n284\n)\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n(\n286\n)\n2023\nNet gain\n$\n(\n120\n)\n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n(\n125\n)\nAmortization of prior service credit\n—\n \n2\n \n2\n \nAmortization of actuarial gain\n2\n \n3\n \n5\n \nTotal recognized in other comprehensive income, pre-tax\n$\n(\n118\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n118\n)\nAssumptions\nThe assumed weighted-average rates used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 were:\nPension\nBenefits \nOther\nPostretirement\nBenefits \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nDiscount rate\n5.50\n \n%\n5.00\n \n%\n5.50\n \n%\n5.00\n \n%\nRate of increase in future compensation levels\n3.30\n \n3.32\n \n—\n \n—\n \nThe assumed weighted-average rates used to determine net benefit expense for the years ended December 31 were:\nPension Benefits\n \nOther\nPostretirement Benefits \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n5.02\n \n%\n5.00\n \n%\n2.75\n \n%\n5.00\n \n%\n5.00\n \n%\n2.75\n \n%\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets\n6.23\n \n6.25\n \n6.25\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRate of increase in future compensation levels\n3.32\n \n3.33\n \n3.35\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nThe discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Company’s future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that would produce cash flows similar to the Company’s benefit plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in general as of the year-end.\n160\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption as of each measurement date was developed through analysis of historical market returns, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds’ past experience, and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected rate of return assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the plan assets, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year.\nThe Company’s defined benefit pension plan is sensitive to the long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the net periodic pension benefit for 2024 to changes in these assumptions, with all other assumptions held constant, \n25\n basis-point increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in an increase in the net periodic pension benefit of approximately $\n8\n million; and the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in net periodic pension benefit of approximately $\n1\n million. Decreases of \n25\n basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. Additionally, an increase of \n25\n basis points in the discount rate would have decreased the benefit obligation by $\n48\n million and a decrease of \n25\n basis points in the discount rate would have increased the benefit obligation by $\n50\n million at December 31, 2024. \nFor measurement of other postretirement benefits, a \n7.00\n% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2024. The rate was assumed to decrease to \n5.00\n% over \neight years\n.\nPlan assets\nThe Company’s policy is to invest the pension plan assets in a prudent manner for the purpose of providing benefit payments to participants and mitigating reasonable expenses of administration. The Company’s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long-term, places an emphasis on the preservation of capital. The strategy attempts to maximize investment returns on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Company while complying with applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes asset diversification as a principal determinant for establishing an appropriate risk profile while emphasizing total return realized from capital appreciation, dividends and interest income. The target allocations for plan assets are generally \n25\n to \n60\n percent equity securities, \n10\n to \n65\n percent debt securities, and \n5\n to \n60\n percent money-market investments/cash equivalents and other investments, although holdings could be more or less than these general guidelines based on market conditions at the time and actions taken or recommended by the investment managers providing advice to the Company. Assets are managed by a combination of internal and external investment managers. Equity securities may include investments in domestic and international equities through individual securities, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Debt securities may include investments in corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by government agencies and U.S. Treasury securities through individual securities and mutual funds. Additionally, the Company’s defined benefit pension plan held $\n828\n million (\n26\n% of total assets) of real estate funds, private investments, hedge funds and other investments at December 31, 2024. \nNo\n investment in securities of a non-U.S. Government or government agency issuer exceeded \nten\n percent of plan assets at December 31, 2024. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns.

The Company is not required to make contributions to the qualified defined benefit plan in 2025, however, subject to the impact of actual events and circumstances that may occur in 2025, the Company may make contributions, but the amount of any such contributions has not been determined. The Company regularly funds the payment of benefit obligations for the supplemental defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans because such plans do not hold assets for investment. Payments made by the Company for supplemental pension benefits were $\n16\n million and $\n18\n million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Payments made by the Company for postretirement benefits were $\n2\n million in 2024 and $\n3\n million in 2023. Payments for supplemental pension and other postretirement benefits for 2025 are not expected to differ from those made in 2024 by an amount that will be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position.\nEstimated benefits expected to be paid in future years related to the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans are as follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nPension\nBenefits\nOther\nPostretirement\nBenefits\nYear ending December 31: \n2025\n$\n159\n \n$\n4\n \n2026\n152\n \n4\n \n2027\n154\n \n4\n \n2028\n156\n \n4\n \n2029\n157\n \n4\n \n2030 through 2034\n778\n \n18\n \nThe Company also provides a qualified defined contribution pension plan to eligible employees who were not participants in the defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2005 and to other employees who have elected to participate in the defined contribution plan. The Company makes contributions to the defined contribution plan each year in an amount that is based on an individual participant’s total compensation (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation, commissions and bonuses) and years of service. Company contributions to the plan are discretionary for participants for which eligibility occurred after January 1, 2020. Participants do not contribute to the defined contribution pension plan. Pension expense recorded in 2024, 2023 and 2022 associated with the defined contribution pension plan was $\n62\n million, $\n56\n million and $\n45\n million, respectively.\n164\nThe Company has a retirement savings plan that is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to \n50\n% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The retirement savings plan provides for employer matching contributions of \n100\n% of an employee's qualified compensation up to \n5\n%. Employees’ accounts, including employee contributions, employer matching contributions and accumulated earnings thereon, are at all times fully vested and nonforfeitable. Employee benefits expense resulting from the Company’s contributions to the retirement savings plan totaled $\n100\n million, $\n96\n million and $\n84\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n13.\nIncome taxes\nThe components of income tax expense were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, \n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n399\n \n$\n580\n \n$\n367\n \nState and local\n169\n \n228\n \n143\n \nTotal current\n568\n \n808\n \n510\n \nDeferred:\nFederal\n(\n21\n)\n(\n64\n)\n(\n18\n)\nState and local\n(\n6\n)\n(\n33\n)\n(\n12\n)\nTotal deferred\n(\n27\n)\n(\n97\n)\n(\n30\n)\nAmortization of investments in partnerships under proportional \n   amortization method\n181\n \n167\n \n140\n \nTotal income taxes\n$\n722\n \n$\n878\n \n$\n620\n \nThe Company files a consolidated federal income tax return reflecting taxable income earned by all domestic subsidiaries. In prior years, applicable federal tax law allowed certain financial institutions the option of deducting as bad debt expense for tax purposes amounts in excess of actual losses. In accordance with GAAP, such financial institutions were not required to provide deferred income taxes on such excess. Recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserve established under the previously allowed method will result in taxable income if M&T Bank fails to maintain bank status as defined in the Internal Revenue Code or charges are made to the reserve for other than bad debt losses. At December 31, 2024, M&T Bank’s tax bad debt reserve for which no federal income taxes have been provided was $\n137\n million. No actions are planned that would cause this reserve to become wholly or partially taxable.\nTotal income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, \n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome taxes at statutory federal income tax rate\n$\n695\n \n$\n760\n \n$\n548\n \nIncrease (decrease) in taxes:\nTax-exempt income\n(\n53\n)\n(\n51\n)\n(\n37\n)\nState and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effect\n136\n \n161\n \n110\n \nTax benefits for investments in partnerships under proportional amortization method, net\n(\n38\n)\n(\n26\n)\n(\n22\n)\nOther\n(\n18\n)\n34\n \n21\n \nTotal income taxes\n$\n722\n \n$\n878\n \n$\n620\n \n165\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities) were comprised of the following at December 31:\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nLosses on loans and other assets\n$\n671\n \n$\n686\n \n$\n641\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n170\n \n182\n \n183\n \nPostretirement and other employee benefits\n63\n \n47\n \n—\n \nIncentive and other compensation plans\n36\n \n30\n \n34\n \nUnrealized losses\n52\n \n64\n \n115\n \nInterest on loans\n28\n \n42\n \n54\n \nLosses on cash flow hedges\n34\n \n52\n \n87\n \nStock-based compensation\n49\n \n54\n \n51\n \nOther\n139\n \n153\n \n81\n \nGross deferred tax assets\n1,242\n \n1,310\n \n1,246\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nRetirement benefits\n(\n304\n)\n(\n198\n)\n(\n88\n)\nLeases\n(\n150\n)\n(\n171\n)\n(\n204\n)\nRight-of-use assets\n(\n147\n)\n(\n165\n)\n(\n163\n)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(\n56\n)\n(\n157\n)\n(\n155\n)\nCapitalized servicing rights\n(\n36\n)\n(\n38\n)\n(\n51\n)\nPostretirement and other employee benefits\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n29\n)\nOther\n(\n68\n)\n(\n59\n)\n(\n69\n)\nGross deferred tax liabilities\n(\n761\n)\n(\n788\n)\n(\n759\n)\nNet deferred tax asset\n$\n481\n \n$\n522\n \n$\n487\n \nThe Company believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies.\nThe income tax credits shown in the statement of income of M&T in note 24 arise principally from operating losses before dividends from subsidiaries.\n166\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nFederal,\nState and\nLocal Tax \nAccrued\nInterest \nUnrecognized\nIncome Tax\nBenefits \nGross unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2022\n$\n38\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n46\n \nIncreases as a result of tax positions taken in prior years\n—\n \n3\n \n3\n \nUnrecognized tax benefits assumed in a business combination\n3\n \n1\n \n4\n \nDecreases as a result of tax positions taken in prior years\n(\n11\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n15\n)\nGross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022\n30\n \n8\n \n38\n \nIncreases as a result of tax positions taken in prior years\n5\n \n1\n \n6\n \nDecreases as a result of tax positions taken in prior years\n(\n13\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n16\n)\nGross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2023\n22\n \n6\n \n28\n \nIncreases as a result of tax positions taken in prior years\n13\n \n7\n \n20\n \nDecreases as a result of tax positions taken in prior years\n(\n10\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n12\n)\nGross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024\n$\n25\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n36\n \nLess: Federal, state and local income tax benefits\n(\n7\n)\nNet unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024 that, \n   if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate\n$\n29\n \nThe Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company’s federal, state and local income tax returns are routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should determinations rendered by tax authorities ultimately indicate that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. Examinations by the Internal Revenue Service of the Company’s federal income tax returns have been largely concluded through 2022, although under statute the income tax returns from 2021 through 2023 could be adjusted. The Company also files income tax returns in over \nforty\n states and numerous local jurisdictions. Substantially all material state and local matters have been concluded for years through 2018. It is not reasonably possible to estimate when examinations for any subsequent years will be completed.\n167\n14.\nEarnings per common share\nThe computations of basic earnings per common share

of managing interest rate risk, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the Company’s portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company designates interest rate swap agreements utilized in the management of interest rate risk as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Interest rate swap agreements are generally entered into with counterparties that meet established credit standards and most contain master netting, collateral and/or settlement provisions protecting the at-risk party. Based on adherence to the Company’s credit standards and the presence of the netting, collateral or settlement provisions, the Company believes that the credit risk inherent in these contracts was not material as of December 31, 2024. \n171\nInformation about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes summarized by type of financial instrument those agreements were intended to hedge follows:\nNotional\nAmount\nWeighted-Average\nMaturity\n(In years)\nWeighted- \nAverage Rate\nEstimated\nFair Value\nGain (Loss) (a) \n(Dollars in millions)\nFixed\n \nVariable \nDecember 31, 2024\nFair value hedges:\nFixed rate long-term borrowings (b) (d)\n$\n5,350\n \n5.9\n3.55\n \n%\n4.71\n \n%\n$\n(\n2\n)\nFixed rate investment securities available for sale (c)\n15\n \n0.1\n4.84\n \n4.36\n \n—\n \nCash flow hedges:\nInterest payments on variable rate commercial real \n   estate and commercial and industrial loans (b) (e)\n30,819\n \n1.6\n3.41\n \n4.47\n \n1\n \nTotal\n$\n36,184\n \n2.2\n$\n(\n1\n)\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair value hedges:\nFixed rate long-term borrowings (b) (f)\n$\n3,000\n \n5.8\n3.45\n \n%\n5.62\n \n%\n$\n(\n1\n)\nCash flow hedges:\nInterest payments on variable rate commercial real estate loans (b) (g)\n23,977\n \n1.7\n3.45\n \n5.36\n \n11\n \nTotal\n$\n26,977\n \n2.2\n$\n10\n \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nCertain clearinghouse exchanges consider payments by counterparties for variation margin on derivative instruments to be settlements of those positions. The impact of such payments for interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges was a net settlement of losses of $\n153\n million and $\n43\n million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The impact of such payments on interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges was a net settlement of losses of $\n136\n million and $\n214\n million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(b)\nUnder the terms of these agreements, the Company receives settlement amounts at a fixed rate and pays at a variable rate.\n(c)\nUnder the terms of these agreements, the Company receives settlement amounts at a variable rate and pays at a fixed rate.\n(d)\nIncludes notional amount and terms of $\n3.4\n billion of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements that become effective in 2025 and 2026.\n(e)\nIncludes notional amount and terms of $\n10.0\n billion of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements that become effective in 2025 and 2026.\n(f)\nIncludes notional amount and terms of $\n1.0\n billion of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements that become effective in 2025.\n(g)\nIncludes notional amount and terms of $\n9.0\n billion of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements that became effective in 2024.\nThe notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes that were outstanding at December 31, 2024 mature as follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nYear ending December 31: \n2025\n$\n10,384\n \n2026\n10,450\n \n2027\n6,000\n \n2028\n6,500\n \n2029\n—\n \nLater years\n2,850\n \n$\n36,184\n \n172\nThe Company utilizes commitments to sell residential and commercial real estate loans to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real estate loans held for sale. Such commitments have generally been designated as fair value hedges. The Company also utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain commitments to originate real estate loans for sale. Changes in unrealized gains and losses as a result of such activities were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Such changes are included in Mortgage banking revenues in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income and, in general, are realized in subsequent periods as the related loans are sold and commitments satisfied.\nOther derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments included interest rate contracts, foreign exchange and other option and futures contracts. Interest rate contracts not designated as hedging instruments had notional values of $\n40.5\n billion and $\n44.4\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts not designated as hedging instruments aggregated $\n1.6\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nInformation about the fair values of derivative instruments in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income follows:\nAsset Derivatives\nLiability Derivatives\nFair Value\nFair Value\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nDerivatives designated and qualifying as hedging instruments (a)\nInterest rate swap agreements\n$\n2\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n2\n \nCommitments to sell real estate loans\n4\n \n6\n \n—\n \n8\n \n \n6\n \n18\n \n3\n \n10\n \nDerivatives not designated and qualifying as hedging \n   instruments (a)\nMortgage banking:\nCommitments to originate real estate loans for sale\n4\n \n15\n \n32\n \n32\n \nCommitments to sell real estate loans\n39\n \n35\n \n—\n \n3\n \n43\n \n50\n \n32\n \n35\n \nOther:\nInterest rate contracts (b)\n185\n \n237\n \n769\n \n879\n \nForeign exchange and other option and futures contracts\n21\n \n19\n \n18\n \n19\n \n206\n \n256\n \n787\n \n898\n \nTotal derivatives\n$\n255\n \n$\n324\n \n$\n822\n \n$\n943\n \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nAsset derivatives are reported in Accrued interest and other assets and liability derivatives are reported in Accrued interest and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b)\nThe impact of variation margin payments at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was a reduction of the estimated fair value of interest rate contracts not designated as hedging instruments in an asset position of $\n686\n million and $\n783\n million, respectively, and in a liability position of $\n15\n million and $\n32\n million, respectively.\n \n173\nAmount of Gain (Loss) Recognized\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Dollars in millions)\nDerivative\nHedged Item\n \nDerivative\n \nHedged Item\nDerivative\n \nHedged Item\nDerivatives in fair value \n   hedging relationships\nInterest rate swap agreements:\nFixed rate long-term borrowings (a)\n$\n(\n111\n)\n$\n111\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n(\n21\n)\n$\n(\n109\n)\n$\n109\n \nFixed rate investment securities \n   available for sale (b)\n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n(\n111\n)\n$\n111\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n(\n21\n)\n$\n(\n109\n)\n$\n109\n \nDerivatives not designated as \n   hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts (c)\n$\n15\n \n$\n31\n \n \n$\n28\n \nForeign exchange and other option and \n   futures contracts (c)\n21\n \n15\n \n \n14\n \nTotal\n$\n36\n \n$\n46\n \n \n$\n42\n \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nReported as an adjustment to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n(b)\nReported as an adjustment to Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n(c)\nReported as Trading account and other non-hedging derivative gains in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nCarrying Amount of the\nHedged Item\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Increasing (Decreasing) the Carrying\nAmount of the Hedged Item \n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nLocation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet \n   of the Hedged Items in Fair Value Hedges\n \nLong-term borrowings\n$\n5,184\n \n$\n2,954\n \n$\n(\n155\n)\n$\n(\n44\n)\nInvestment securities available for sale\n381\n \n \n—\n \n \nThe net effect of interest rate swap agreements was to decrease net interest income by $\n414\n million in 2024, $\n302\n million in 2023 and $\n26\n million in 2022. The amount of interest income recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was a \ndecrease\n of $\n364\n million for 2024, $\n250\n million for 2023 and $\n36\n million for 2022. As of December 31, 2024, the unrealized loss recognized in other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges was $\n135\n million, of which losses of $\n47\n million and $\n49\n million, gains of $\n6\n million and losses of $\n45\n million relate to interest rate swap agreements maturing in 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nThe Company does not offset derivative asset and liability positions in its consolidated financial statements. The Company’s exposure to credit risk by entering into derivative contracts is mitigated through master netting agreements and collateral posting or settlement requirements. Master netting agreements covering interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with the same party include a right to set-off that becomes enforceable in the event of default, early termination or under other specific conditions.\nThe Company primarily clears non-customer derivative transactions through a clearinghouse, rather than directly with counterparties. The transactions cleared through a clearinghouse require initial margin collateral and variation margin payments depending on the contracts being in a net asset or liability position. The amount of initial margin collateral posted by the Company was $\n257\n million and $\n129\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value asset and liability amounts of derivative contracts have been reduced by variation margin payments treated as \n174\nsettlements as described herein. Variation margin on derivative contracts not treated as settlements continues to represent collateral posted or received by the Company.\nThe aggregate fair value of derivative financial instruments in a liability position, which are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, and the related collateral posted, was not material at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Certain of the Company’s derivative financial instruments contain provisions that require the Company to maintain specific credit ratings from credit rating agencies to avoid higher collateral posting requirements. If the Company’s debt ratings were to fall below specified ratings, the counterparties of the derivative financial instruments could demand immediate incremental collateralization on those instruments in a net liability position. The aggregate fair value of all derivative financial instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position at December 31, 2024 was not material.\nThe aggregate fair value of derivative financial instruments in an asset position with counterparties, which are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, was $\n157\n million and $\n179\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Counterparties posted collateral relating to those positions of $\n157\n million and $\n179\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest rate swap agreements entered into with customers are subject to the Company’s credit risk standards and often contain collateral provisions.\n18.\nVariable interest entities and asset securitizations\nThe Company’s securitization activity includes securitizing loans originated for sale into government-issued or guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. The Company has \nno\nt recognized any material losses as a result of having securitized assets.\nIn three transactions throughout 2023 and 2024, M&T Bank and its subsidiaries issued asset-backed notes secured by either equipment finance loans and leases or by automobile loans. Those loans and leases were sold into special purpose trusts which in turn issued asset-backed notes to investors. The loans and leases continue to be serviced by the Company. The senior-most notes in the securitizations were purchased by third parties whereas the residual interests of the trusts were retained by the Company. As a result of the retention of the residual interests and its continued role as servicer of the loans and leases, the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the securitization trusts and, accordingly, the trusts have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2024, the remaining balance of the loans and leases in those securitization trusts were $\n1.5\n billion and the outstanding asset-backed notes issued to third party investors were $\n1.2\n billion. Information on the asset-backed notes is included in note 8. \nAs also described in note 8, M&T has issued Junior Subordinated Debentures payable to various trusts that have issued Preferred Capital Securities and Common Securities. M&T owns the Common Securities of those trust entities. The Company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary of those entities and, accordingly, the trusts are not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. At each of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company included the Junior Subordinated Debentures as Long-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognized $\n17\n million and $\n22\n million, respectively, in Accrued interest and other assets for its \"investment\" in the Common Securities of the trusts that will be concomitantly repaid to M&T by the respective trust from the proceeds of M&T’s repayment of the Junior Subordinated Debentures associated with the Preferred Capital Securities.\nThe Company has invested as a limited partner in various partnerships that collectively had total assets of approximately $\n10.5\n billion and $\n9.8\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Those partnerships generally construct or acquire properties, including properties and facilities that produce renewable energy, for which the investing partners are eligible to receive certain federal income tax credits in accordance with government guidelines. Such investments may also provide tax deductible losses to the partners. The partnership investments also assist the Company in achieving \n175\nits community reinvestment initiatives. The Company, in its position as a limited partner, does not direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the partnerships and, therefore, the partnership entities are not included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company’s investments in qualified affordable housing projects are accounted for using the proportional amortization method whereby those investments are amortized to Income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income as tax credits and other tax benefits resulting from deductible losses associated with the projects are received. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company adopted amended guidance which permits an election to account for other tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. The Company has elected to apply the proportional amortization method to eligible renewable energy and certain other tax credit investments in addition to the low income housing tax credit investments for which the proportional amortization method had previously been applied. \nInformation on the Company's carrying amount of its investments in tax equity partnerships and its related future funding commitments are presented in the following table:\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nAffordable housing projects:\nCarrying amount (a)\n$\n1,384\n \n$\n1,340\n \nAmount of future funding commitments included in carrying amount (b)\n467\n \n410\n \nContingent commitments\n69\n \n55\n \nRenewable energy:\nCarrying amount (a)\n135\n \n80\n \nAmount of future funding commitments included in carrying amount (b)\n46\n \n31\n \nOther:\nCarrying amount (a)\n37\n \n41\n \nAmount of future funding commitments included in carrying amount (b)\n—\n \n—\n \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nIncluded in Accrued interest and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b)\nIncluded in Accrued interest and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe reduction to \nincome tax expense\n recognized from the Company's investments in partnerships accounted for using the proportional amortization method was $\n38\n million (net of $\n181\n million of investment amortization), $\n26\n million (net of $\n167\n million of investment amortization) and $\n22\n million (net of $\n140\n million of investment amortization) in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net reduction to income tax expense has been reported in Net change in other accrued income and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While the Company has elected to apply the proportional amortization method for renewable energy credit investments, at December 31, 2024 no such investments met the eligibility criteria for application of that method. The reduction to income tax expense recognized from renewable energy credit investments was $\n34\n million, $\n33\n million and $\n17\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a limited partner, there is no recourse to the Company by creditors of the partnerships. However, the tax credits that result from the Company’s investments in such partnerships are generally subject to recapture should a partnership fail to comply with the respective government regulations. The Company has not provided financial or other support to the partnerships that was not contractually required. Although the Company currently estimates that no material losses are probable, its maximum exposure to loss from its investments in such partnerships as of December 31, 2024 was $\n2.0\n billion, including possible recapture of certain tax credits. \n176\nThe Company serves as investment advisor for certain registered money-market funds. The Company has no explicit arrangement to provide support to those funds, but may waive portions of its allowable management fees as a result of market conditions.\n19.\nFair value measurements\nGAAP permits an entity to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and other items at fair value. The Company has not made any fair value elections at December 31, 2024.\nPursuant to GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy exists in GAAP for fair value measurements based upon the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability.\n•\nLevel 1 — Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 — Valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or by model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.\n•\nLevel 3 — Valuation is derived from model-based and other techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and which may be based on the Company’s own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability.\nWhen available, the Company attempts to use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value and classifies such items as Level 1 or Level 2. If quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair value is often determined using model-based techniques incorporating various assumptions including interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit losses. Assets and liabilities valued using model-based techniques are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, depending on the lowest level classification of an input that is considered significant to the overall valuation. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis at estimated fair value.\nTrading account \nMutual funds held in connection with deferred compensation and other arrangements have been classified as Level 1 valuations. Valuations of investments in debt securities can generally be obtained through reference to quoted prices in less active markets for the same or similar securities or through model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such valuations have been classified as Level 2.\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities and equity securities\nThe Company’s available-for-sale investment securities have generally been valued by reference to prices for similar securities or through model-based techniques in which the significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such valuations have been classified as Level 2. Certain investments in mutual funds and equity securities are actively traded and, therefore, have been classified as Level 1 valuations.\n177\nReal estate loans held for sale\nThe Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real estate loans held for sale. The carrying value of hedged real estate loans held for sale includes changes in estimated fair value during the hedge period. Typically, the Company attempts to hedge real estate loans held for sale from the date of close through the sale date. The fair value of hedged real estate loans held for sale is generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell real estate loans with similar characteristics and, accordingly, such loans have been classified as a Level 2 valuation.\nCommitments to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans\nThe Company enters into various commitments to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans. Such commitments are accounted for as derivative financial instruments and, therefore, are carried at estimated fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The estimated fair values of such commitments were generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell real estate loans to certain government-sponsored entities and other parties. The fair valuations of commitments to sell real estate loans generally result in a Level 2 classification. The estimated fair value of commitments to originate real estate loans for sale is adjusted to reflect the Company’s anticipated commitment expirations. The estimated commitment expirations are considered significant unobservable inputs contributing to the Level 3 classification of commitments to originate real estate loans for sale. Significant unobservable inputs used in the determination of estimated fair value of commitments to originate real estate loans for sale are included in the accompanying table of assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis.\nInterest rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk management\nThe Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company generally determines the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements using externally developed pricing models based on market observable inputs and, therefore, classifies such valuations as Level 2. The Company has considered counterparty credit risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap agreement assets and has considered its own credit risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap agreement liabilities.\nOther non-hedging derivatives\nOther non-hedging derivatives consist primarily of interest rate contracts and foreign exchange contracts with customers who require such services with offsetting positions with third parties to minimize the Company's risk with respect to such transactions. The Company generally determines the fair value of other non-hedging derivative assets and liabilities using externally developed pricing models based on market observable inputs and, therefore, classifies such valuations as Level 2.\n178\nThe following tables present assets and liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis:\n(Dollars in millions)\nFair Value Measurements\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3 (a)\nDecember 31, 2024\nTrading account\n$\n101\n \n$\n101\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nInvestment securities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasury\n7,931\n \n—\n \n7,931\n \n—\n \nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment issued or guaranteed:\nCommercial\n3,702\n \n—\n \n3,702\n \n—\n \nResidential\n7,214\n \n—\n \n7,214\n \n—\n \nOther\n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n18,849\n \n—\n \n18,849\n \n—\n \nEquity securities\n235\n \n235\n \n—\n \n—\n \nReal estate loans held for sale\n521\n \n—\n \n521\n \n—\n \nOther assets (b)\n255\n \n—\n \n251\n \n4\n \nTotal assets\n$\n19,961\n \n$\n336\n \n$\n19,621\n \n$\n4\n \nOther liabilities (b)\n$\n822\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n790\n \n$\n32\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n822\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n790\n \n$\n32\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nTrading account\n$\n106\n \n$\n101\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n—\n \nInvestment securities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasury\n7,705\n \n—\n \n7,705\n \n—\n \nMortgage-backed securities:\nGovernment issued or guaranteed:\nCommercial\n416\n \n—\n \n416\n \n—\n \nResidential\n2,154\n \n—\n \n2,154\n \n—\n \nOther\n165\n \n—\n \n165\n \n—\n \n10,440\n \n—\n \n10,440\n \n—\n \nEquity securities\n268\n \n258\n \n10\n \n—\n \nReal estate loans held for sale\n379\n \n—\n \n379\n \n—\n \nOther assets (b)\n324\n \n—\n \n309\n \n15\n \nTotal assets\n$\n11,517\n \n$\n359\n \n$\n11,143\n \n$\n15\n \nOther liabilities (b)\n$\n943\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n911\n \n$\n32\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n943\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n911\n \n$\n32\n \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nSignificant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of commitments to originate real estate loans held for sale included weighted-average commitment expirations of \n6\n% at December 31, 2024 and \n5\n% at December 31, 2023. An increase (decrease) in the estimate of expirations for commitments to originate real estate loans would generally result in a lower (higher) fair value measurement. Estimated commitment expirations are derived considering loan type, changes in interest rates and remaining length of time until closing.\n(b)\nComprised predominantly of interest rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk management (Level 2), interest rate and foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments (Level 2), commitments to sell real estate loans (Level 2) and commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale (Level 3).\n179\nThe Company is required, on a nonrecurring basis, to adjust the carrying value of certain assets or provide valuation allowances related to certain assets using fair value measurements. The more significant of those assets follow.\nLoans\nLoans are generally not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Periodically, the Company records nonrecurring adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectable portions of those loans. Nonrecurring adjustments also include certain impairment amounts for collateral-dependent loans when establishing the allowance for credit losses. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the loan less the calculated valuation amount does not necessarily represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is typically valued using appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable in the marketplace and the related nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have generally been classified as Level 2, unless significant adjustments have been made to the valuation that are not readily observable by market participants. Non-real estate collateral supporting commercial and industrial loans generally consists of business assets such as receivables, inventory and equipment. Fair value estimations are typically determined by discounting recorded values of those assets to reflect estimated net realizable value considering specific borrower facts and circumstances and the experience of credit personnel in their dealings with similar borrower collateral liquidations. Such discounts were generally in the range of \n10\n% to \n90\n% with a weighted-average of \n50\n% at December 31, 2024. As these discounts are not readily observable and are considered significant, the valuations have been classified as Level 3. Automobile and recreational vehicle collateral is typically valued by reference to independent pricing sources based on recent sales transactions of similar vehicles and the related nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have been classified as Level 2. Loans subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement were $\n847\n million at December 31, 2024 ($\n187\n million and $\n660\n million of which were classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively), $\n923\n million at December 31, 2023 ($\n234\n million and $\n689\n million of which were classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively), and $\n853\n million at December 31, 2022 ($\n329\n million and $\n524\n million of which were classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively). Changes in fair value recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for partial charge-offs of loans and loan impairment reserves on loans held by the Company at the end of each of those years were decreases of $\n287\n million, $\n381\n million and $\n191\n million, respectively.\nAssets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans\nAssets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans are primarily comprised of commercial and residential real property and are generally measured at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value of the real property is generally determined using appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable in the marketplace and the related nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have generally been classified as Level 2. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement were not material at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Changes in fair value recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for foreclosed assets held by the Company at the end of each of those years were not material.\n180\nCapitalized servicing rights\nCapitalized servicing rights are initially measured at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company utilizes the amortization method to subsequently measure its capitalized servicing assets. In accordance with GAAP, the Company must record impairment charges, on a nonrecurring basis, when the carrying value of certain strata exceed their estimated fair value. To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company considers market prices for similar assets, if available, and the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing rights calculated using assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future servicing income and expense. Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing loans, loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate and prepayment speeds. For purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing rights, the Company stratifies such assets based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying financial instruments that are expected to have the most impact on projected prepayments, cost of servicing and other factors affecting future cash flows associated with the servicing rights. Such factors may include financial asset or loan type, note rate and term. The amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceed estimated fair value. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance. The determination of fair value of capitalized servicing rights is considered a Level 3 valuation. Capitalized servicing rights related to mortgage loans required \nno\n valuation allowance at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Changes in fair value recognized for impairment of capitalized servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans were a decrease in the valuation allowance of $\n24\n million in 2022. \n181\nDisclosures of fair value of financial instruments\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair value for certain financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are presented in the following table:\n(Dollars in millions)\nCarrying\nAmount \nEstimated\nFair Value \nLevel 1\nLevel 2 \nLevel 3 \nDecember 31, 2024\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,909\n \n$\n1,909\n \n$\n1,749\n \n$\n160\n \n$\n—\n \nInterest-bearing deposits at banks\n18,873\n \n18,873\n \n—\n \n18,873\n \n—\n \nInvestment securities held to maturity\n14,195\n \n12,955\n \n—\n \n12,909\n \n46\n \nLoans and leases, net\n133,397\n \n131,334\n \n—\n \n6,806\n \n124,528\n \nFinancial liabilities:\nTime deposits\n14,476\n \n14,463\n \n—\n \n14,463\n \n—\n \nShort-term borrowings\n1,060\n \n1,060\n \n—\n \n1,060\n \n—\n \nLong-term borrowings\n12,605\n \n12,754\n \n—\n \n12,754\n \n—\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,731\n \n1,731\n \n1,668\n \n63\n \n—\n \nInterest-bearing deposits at banks\n28,069\n \n28,069\n \n—\n \n28,069\n \n—\n \nInvestment securities held to maturity\n15,330\n \n14,308\n \n—\n \n14,262\n \n46\n \nLoans and leases, net\n131,939\n \n129,138\n \n—\n \n7,240\n \n121,898\n \nFinancial liabilities:\nTime deposits\n20,759\n \n20,715\n \n—\n \n20,715\n \n—\n \nShort-term borrowings\n5,316\n \n5,316\n \n—\n \n5,316\n \n—\n \nLong-term borrowings\n8,201\n \n8,107\n \n—\n \n8,107\n \n—\n \nWith the exception of marketable securities and mortgage loans originated for sale, the Company’s financial instruments presented in the preceding tables are not readily marketable and market prices do not exist. The Company has not attempted to market its financial instruments to potential buyers, if any exist. Since negotiated prices in illiquid markets depend greatly upon the then present motivations of the buyer and seller, it is reasonable to assume that actual sales prices could vary widely from any estimate of fair value made without the benefit of negotiations. Additionally, changes in market interest rates can dramatically impact the value of financial instruments in a short period of time. \nThe Company does not believe that the estimated information presented herein is representative of the earnings power or value of the Company. The preceding analysis, which is inherently limited in depicting fair value, also does not consider any value associated with existing customer relationships nor the ability of the Company to create value through loan origination, deposit gathering or fee generating activities. Many of the estimates presented herein are based upon the use of highly subjective information and assumptions and, accordingly, the results may not be precise. Management believes that fair value estimates may not be comparable between financial institutions due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made. Furthermore, because the disclosed fair value amounts were estimated as of the balance sheet date, the amounts actually realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the various financial instruments could be significantly different.\n182\n20.\nCommitments and contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding. \nThe following table presents the Company’s significant commitments. Certain of these commitments are not included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nCommitments to extend credit:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n31,521\n \n$\n28,566\n \nCommercial real estate loans to be sold\n479\n \n916\n \nOther commercial real estate\n2,697\n \n5,019\n \nResidential real estate loans to be sold\n190\n \n163\n \nOther residential real estate\n517\n \n331\n \nHome equity lines of credit\n7,933\n \n8,109\n \nCredit cards\n6,087\n \n5,578\n \nOther\n244\n \n413\n \nStandby letters of credit\n2,260\n \n2,289\n \nCommercial letters of credit\n58\n \n62\n \nFinancial guarantees and indemnification contracts\n4,335\n \n4,036\n \nCommitments to sell real estate loans\n1,142\n \n1,400\n \nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. In addition to the amounts presented in the preceding table, the Company had discretionary funding commitments to commercial customers of $\n12.7\n billion and $\n12.3\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that the Company had the unconditional right to cancel prior to funding. Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party, whereas commercial letters of credit are issued to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being funded when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and a third party. The credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and is subject to normal credit policies. Collateral may be obtained based on management’s assessment of the customer’s creditworthiness.\nFinancial guarantees and indemnification contracts are predominantly comprised of recourse obligations associated with sold loans and other guarantees and commitments. Included in financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are loan principal amounts sold with recourse in conjunction with the Company’s involvement in the Fannie Mae DUS program. The Company’s maximum credit risk for recourse associated with loans sold under this program totaled approximately $\n4.2\n billion and $\n3.9\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, the Company estimated that the recourse obligations described above were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial position. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those credit recourse arrangements.\nSince many loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees and indemnification contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows.\n183\nThe Company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans held for sale. Such commitments are accounted for as derivatives and along with commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at estimated fair market value.\nThe Company is contractually obligated to repurchase previously sold residential real estate loans that do not ultimately meet investor sale criteria related to underwriting procedures or loan documentation. When required to do so, the Company may reimburse loan purchasers for losses incurred or may repurchase certain loans. The Company reduces residential mortgage banking revenues by an estimate for losses related to its obligations to loan purchasers. The amount of those charges is based on the volume of loans sold, the level of reimbursement requests received from loan purchasers and estimates of losses that may be associated with previously sold loans. At December 31, 2024, the Company believes that its obligation to loan purchasers was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial position.\nM&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings and other matters in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. On an on-going basis management, after consultation with legal counsel, assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with such proceedings. For those matters where it is probable that the Company will incur losses and the amounts of the losses can be reasonably estimated, the Company records an expense and corresponding liability in its consolidated financial statements. To the extent the pending or threatened litigation could result in exposure in excess of that liability, the amount of such excess is not currently estimable. Although not considered probable, the range of reasonably possible losses for such matters in the aggregate, beyond the existing recorded liability, was between $\n0\n and $\n25\n million at December 31, 2024. Although the Company does not believe that the outcome of pending litigations will be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position, it cannot rule out the possibility that such outcomes will be material to the consolidated results of operations for a particular reporting period in the future. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule on special assessment pursuant to systemic risk determination resulting from the closures of certain failed banks. As a result, the Company recorded an estimated expense of $\n197\n million for the special assessment in the 2023 results of operations. In 2024, the FDIC notified member banks that the loss estimate attributable to certain failed banks had increased. The Company recorded FDIC special assessment expense of $\n34\n million in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a liability related to the FDIC special assessment of $\n157\n million and $\n197\n million, respectively. Such amounts are classified as Accrued interest and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The FDIC has indicated that the amount of the special assessment may be adjusted in the future should its loss estimates change.\n \n184\n21.\nSegment information\nReportable segments have been determined based upon the Company’s organizational structure which is primarily arranged around the delivery of products and services to similar customer types. The Company's internal profitability reporting system produces financial information, inclusive of net interest income and income before taxes, for each segment. Such information is reviewed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the chief operating decision maker, in evaluating operating decisions, business performance and the allocation of resources. The Company's reportable segments are Commercial Bank, Retail Bank and Institutional Services and Wealth Management.\nThe financial information of the Company’s segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 1 with certain exceptions. The more significant of these exceptions are described herein. The Company allocates interest income or interest expense using a methodology that charges users of funds (assets) interest expense and credits providers of funds (liabilities) with income based on the maturity, prepayment and/or repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. A provision for credit losses is allocated to segments in an amount based largely on actual net charge-offs incurred by the segment during the period plus or minus an amount necessary to adjust the segment’s allowance for credit losses due to changes in loan balances. In contrast, the level of the consolidated provision for credit losses is determined using the methodologies described in notes 1 and 4. The net effects of these allocations are recorded in the \"All Other\" category. Indirect fixed and variable expenses incurred by certain centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on actual usage (for example, volume measurements) and other criteria. Certain types of administrative expenses and bankwide expense accruals (including amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions of financial institutions) are generally not allocated to segments. Income taxes are allocated to segments based on the Company’s marginal statutory tax rate adjusted for any tax-exempt income or non-deductible expenses. Equity is allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital requirements and in proportion to an assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business of the segment (including interest, credit and operating risk). The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segment results are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data.\n185\nInformation about the Company’s segments is presented in the accompanying table. \nYear Ended December 31,\nCommercial Bank \nRetail Bank \nInstitutional Services and Wealth Management\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet interest income (a)\n$\n2,212\n \n$\n2,409\n \n$\n2,302\n \n$\n4,288\n \n$\n4,352\n \n$\n3,008\n \n$\n748\n \n$\n700\n \n$\n403\n \nNoninterest income\n672\n \n658\n \n588\n \n810\n \n762\n \n703\n \n809\n \n1,005\n \n1,007\n \nTotal revenue\n2,884\n \n3,067\n \n2,890\n \n5,098\n \n5,114\n \n3,711\n \n1,557\n \n1,705\n \n1,410\n \nProvision for credit losses\n266\n \n297\n \n66\n \n288\n \n173\n \n101\n \n6\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nSalaries and employee benefits\n610\n \n577\n \n483\n \n778\n \n779\n \n694\n \n413\n \n405\n \n376\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n39\n \n39\n \n39\n \n252\n \n249\n \n198\n \n9\n \n8\n \n8\n \nOther direct expenses\n285\n \n275\n \n213\n \n421\n \n465\n \n386\n \n102\n \n156\n \n211\n \nIndirect expense (b)\n490\n \n455\n \n389\n \n1,048\n \n964\n \n929\n \n307\n \n298\n \n272\n \nIncome (loss) before taxes\n1,194\n \n1,424\n \n1,700\n \n2,311\n \n2,484\n \n1,403\n \n720\n \n838\n \n544\n \nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n323\n \n385\n \n458\n \n595\n \n646\n \n364\n \n185\n \n218\n \n142\n \nNet income (loss)\n$\n871\n \n$\n1,039\n \n$\n1,242\n \n$\n1,716\n \n$\n1,838\n \n$\n1,039\n \n$\n535\n \n$\n620\n \n$\n402\n \nAverage total assets\n$\n80,864\n \n$\n80,243\n \n$\n69,960\n \n$\n53,043\n \n$\n51,213\n \n$\n49,059\n \n$\n3,800\n \n$\n3,675\n \n$\n3,598\n \nAll Other \nTotal (c)\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet interest income (a)\n$\n(\n396\n)\n$\n(\n346\n)\n$\n109\n \n$\n6,852\n \n$\n7,115\n \n$\n5,822\n \nNoninterest income\n136\n \n103\n59\n2,427\n \n2,528\n2,357\nTotal revenue\n(\n260\n)\n(\n243\n)\n168\n9,279\n \n9,643\n8,179\nProvision for credit losses\n50\n \n175\n351\n610\n \n645\n517\nSalaries and employee benefits\n1,361\n \n1,236\n1,234\n3,162\n \n2,997\n2,787\nDepreciation and amortization\n208\n \n201\n190\n508\n \n497\n435\nOther direct expenses\n881\n \n989\n1,018\n1,689\n \n1,885\n1,828\nIndirect expense (b)\n(\n1,845\n)\n(\n1,717\n)\n(\n1,590\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nIncome (loss) before taxes\n(\n915\n)\n(\n1,127\n)\n(\n1,035\n)\n3,310\n \n3,619\n2,612\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(\n381\n)\n(\n371\n)\n(\n344\n)\n722\n \n878\n620\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(\n534\n)\n$\n(\n756\n)\n$\n(\n691\n)\n$\n2,588\n \n$\n2,741\n \n$\n1,992\n \nAverage total assets\n$\n73,513\n \n$\n70,266\n \n$\n67,635\n \n$\n211,220\n \n$\n205,397\n \n$\n190,252\n \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nNet interest income is the difference between actual taxable-equivalent interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities by a segment and a funding charge (credit) based on the Company’s internal funds transfer pricing methodology.

Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, credit facilities which are secured by various types of commercial real estate, letters of credit, deposit products and cash management services. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by multifamily residential buildings, hotels, office, retail and industrial space or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the Fannie Mae DUS program and other programs. Commercial real estate loans held for sale are included in this segment.\nThe Retail Bank segment provides a wide range of services to consumers and small businesses through the Company’s branch network and several other delivery channels such as telephone banking, internet banking and ATMs. The Company has domestic banking offices primarily in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. including the District of Columbia. The segment offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts, and other services. Credit services offered by this segment include automobile and recreational finance loans (primarily originated indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards and other loan products. This segment also originates and services residential mortgage loans and either sells those loans in the secondary market to investors or retains them for investment purposes. Residential mortgage loans are also originated and serviced on behalf of the Institutional Services and Wealth Management segment. The Company periodically purchases the rights to service residential real estate loans that have been originated by other entities and also sub-services residential real estate loans for others. Residential real estate loans held for sale are included in this segment. This segment also provides various business loans, including loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, business credit cards, deposit products and services such as cash management, payroll and direct deposit, merchant credit card and letters of credits to small businesses and professionals through the Company's branch network and other delivery channels.\nThe Institutional Services and Wealth Management segment provides a variety of trustee, agency, investment management and administrative services for corporations and institutions, investment bankers, corporate tax, finance and legal executives, and other institutional clients, as well as personal trust, planning and advisory, fiduciary, asset management, family office, and other services designed to help high net worth individuals and families grow, preserve and transfer wealth. This segment also provides investment products, including mutual funds and annuities and other services to customers. \nThe \"All Other\" category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments. Reflected in this category are the difference between the provision for credit losses and the calculated provision allocated to the reportable segments; goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of financial institutions; merger-related gains and expenses related to acquisitions; the net impact of the Company’s internal funds transfer pricing methodology; eliminations of transactions between reportable segments; certain non-recurring transactions; and the residual effects of unallocated support systems and general and administrative expenses. The Company’s investment securities portfolio, brokered deposits and short-term and long-term borrowings are generally included in the \"All Other\" category. In its management of interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The results of such activities are captured in the \"All Other\" category.\nThere are no transactions with a single customer that in the aggregate result in revenues that exceed ten percent of consolidated total revenues.\n187\n22.\nRegulatory matters\nPayment of dividends by M&T’s banking subsidiaries is restricted by various legal and regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the preceding two years. For purposes of this test, at December 31, 2024, approximately $\n2.3\n billion was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries. M&T may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that the Federal Reserve has not objected to.\nBanking regulations prohibit extensions of credit by the subsidiary banks to M&T unless appropriately secured by assets. Securities of affiliates are not eligible as collateral for this purpose.\nM&T and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable Capital Rules. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. \nPursuant to the rules in effect as of December 31, 2024, the required minimum and well capitalized capital ratios are as follows: \nMinimum\nWell\nCapitalized\nM&T (Consolidated)\nCET1 capital to RWA\n4.5\n \n%\nTier 1 capital to RWA\n6.0\n \n6.0\n \n%\nTotal capital to RWA\n8.0\n \n10.0\n \nLeverage — Tier 1 capital to average total assets, as defined\n4.0\n \nMinimum\nWell\nCapitalized\nBank Subsidiaries\nCET1 capital to RWA\n4.5\n \n%\n6.5\n \n%\nTier 1 capital to RWA\n6.0\n \n8.0\n \nTotal capital to RWA\n8.0\n \n10.0\n \nLeverage — Tier 1 capital to average total assets, as defined\n4.0\n \n5.0\n \nCapital regulations require buffers in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratios noted above. M&T is subject to a SCB requirement that is determined through the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress tests and M&T’s bank subsidiaries are subject to a \n2.5\n% capital conservation buffer requirement. The buffer requirement must be composed entirely of CET1 capital. In June 2024, the Federal Reserve released the results of its most recent supervisory stress tests. Based on those results on October 1, 2024, M&T's SCB of \n3.8\n% became effective. Accordingly, at December 31, 2024 M&T is subject to a CET1 capital requirement of \n8.3\n% (a sum of the SCB and the minimum CET1 capital ratio).\n188\nThe capital ratios and amounts of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented below:\n(Dollars in millions)\nM&T\n(Consolidated) \nM&T Bank \nWilmington\nTrust, N.A. \nDecember 31, 2024\nCET1 capital\nAmount\n$\n18,299\n \n$\n19,233\n \n$\n603\n \nRatio(a)\n11.68\n \n%\n12.32\n \n%\n269.64\n \n%\nTier 1 capital\nAmount\n$\n20,692\n \n$\n19,233\n \n$\n603\n \nRatio(a)\n13.21\n \n%\n12.32\n \n%\n269.64\n \n%\nTotal capital\nAmount\n$\n23,073\n \n$\n21,387\n \n$\n604\n \nRatio(a)\n14.73\n \n%\n13.70\n \n%\n269.88\n \n%\nLeverage\nAmount\n$\n20,692\n \n$\n19,233\n \n$\n603\n \nRatio(b)\n10.17\n \n%\n9.48\n \n%\n83.37\n \n%\nDecember 31, 2023\nCET1 capital\nAmount\n$\n16,908\n \n$\n17,667\n \n$\n583\n \nRatio(a)\n10.98\n \n%\n11.53\n \n%\n263.48\n \n%\nTier 1 capital\nAmount\n$\n18,918\n \n$\n17,667\n \n$\n583\n \nRatio(a)\n12.29\n \n%\n11.53\n \n%\n263.48\n \n%\nTotal capital\nAmount\n$\n21,533\n \n$\n19,884\n \n$\n584\n \nRatio(a)\n13.99\n \n%\n12.97\n \n%\n263.85\n \n%\nLeverage\nAmount\n$\n18,918\n \n$\n17,667\n \n$\n583\n \nRatio(b)\n9.43\n \n%\n8.83\n \n%\n86.00\n \n%\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n(a)\nThe ratio of capital to RWA, as defined by regulation.\n(b)\nThe ratio of capital to average assets, as defined by regulation.\n \n23.\nRelationship with BLG and Bayview Financial\nM&T holds a \n20\n% minority interest in BLG, a privately-held commercial mortgage company.
