  "item1_text": "Item 1A.\n \nRi\nsk Factors\n \n\n\nOur business and operations, and our industry in general, are subject to a variety of risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the following risks should occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted. As a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in Devon.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n\n\nVolatile Oil, Gas and NGL Prices Significantly Impact Our Business\n\n\nOur financial condition, results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil, gas and NGLs, which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities. Historically, market prices and our realized prices have been volatile. For example, over the last five years, monthly NYMEX WTI oil and NYMEX Henry Hub gas prices ranged from highs of over $120 per Bbl and $9.50 per MMBtu, respectively, to lows of under $30 per Bbl and $1.50 per MMBtu, respectively. Such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n•\nthe domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for oil, gas and NGLs;\n\n\n•\nvolatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets;\n\n\n•\nclimate change incentives and conservation and environmental protection efforts;\n\n\n•\nproduction levels of members of OPEC, Russia, the U.S. or other producing countries;\n\n\n•\ngeopolitical risks, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Gaza and Hezbollah conflicts and hostilities in Yemen and the Red Sea, as well as other hostilities or political and civil unrest in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and South America;\n\n\n•\nadverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and acts of terrorism;\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n•\npandemics (such as COVID-19) and epidemics of infectious diseases and other public health events, as well as any related governmental actions; \n\n\n•\nregional pricing differentials, including in the Delaware Basin and other areas of our operations;\n\n\n•\ndiffering quality of production, including NGL content of gas produced;\n\n\n•\nthe level of imports and exports of oil, gas and NGLs and the level of global oil, gas and NGL inventories;\n\n\n•\nthe price and availability of alternative energy sources;\n\n\n•\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption and production, including with respect to electric vehicles;\n\n\n•\nstockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in order to reduce GHG emissions;\n\n\n•\nthe overall economic environment, including inflationary pressures and fluctuations in interest rates;\n\n\n•\nmarket and geopolitical uncertainty as a result of shifts or potential further shifts in domestic and international policies following the 2024 U.S. presidential and congressional elections;\n\n\n•\nchanges in trade relations and policies, such as (i) the imposition of tariffs by the U.S., China or other countries, (ii) environmental performance standards or similar fossil fuel import restrictions in certain international markets, (iii) economic sanctions, including embargoes, on Russia or other producing countries or (iv) restrictions on oil, gas and NGL exports by the U.S.; and\n\n\n•\nother governmental regulations and taxes.\n\n\nEstimates of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves Are Uncertain and May Be Subject to Revision\n\n\nThe process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors, including additional development and appraisal activity and the related impact to spacing assumptions for future drilling locations, the viability of production under varying economic conditions, including commodity price declines, and variations in production levels and associated costs. Consequently, material revisions to our existing reserves estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these or other factors. Such revisions to proved reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties, as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability. Our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties” of this report.\n\n\nDiscoveries or Acquisitions of Reserves Are Needed to Avoid a Material Decline in Reserves and Production, and Such Activities Are Capital Intensive\n\n\nThe production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Moreover, our current development activity is focused on unconventional oil and gas assets, which generally have significantly higher decline rates as compared to conventional assets. Therefore, our estimated proved reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities, such as identifying additional producing zones in existing properties, utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves. Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.\n\n\nOur business requires significant capital to find and acquire new reserves. Although we plan to primarily fund these activities from cash generated by our operations, we have also from time to time relied on other sources of capital, including by accessing the debt and equity capital markets. There can be no assurance that these or other financing sources will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason, we may be unable to replace our reserves, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nOur Operations Are Uncertain and Involve Substantial Costs and Risks\n\n\nOur operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. Drilling for oil, gas and NGLs can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs. Substantial costs are required to locate, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted. While both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. In addition, our oil and gas properties can become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n•\nunexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations;\n\n\n•\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\n\n•\nfires, explosions, blowouts, cratering or loss of well control, as well as the mishandling or underground migration of fluids and chemicals;\n\n\n•\nadverse weather conditions, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms and extreme temperatures, the severity and frequency of which could potentially increase as a consequence of climate change;\n\n\n•\nother natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and wildfires;\n\n\n•\nterrorism, vandalism, equipment theft, extreme activism directed against fossil fuel operations or assets, cybersecurity incidents and pandemics or other widespread health concerns;\n\n\n•\nissues with title or in receiving governmental permits or approvals;\n\n\n•\nrestricted takeaway capacity for our production, including due to inadequate midstream infrastructure or constrained downstream markets;\n\n\n•\nenvironmental hazards or liabilities;\n\n\n•\nrestrictions in access to, or disposal of, water used or produced in drilling and completion operations;\n\n\n•\nlimited access to electrical power sources or other infrastructure used in our operations; and\n\n\n•\nshortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of material or equipment.\n\n\nMany of the factors described above have negatively impacted and currently impact our operations and may do so again in the future. The occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property, as well as significant liabilities. Moreover, certain of these events historically have, and in the future could, result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties, including persons living in proximity to our operations, our employees and employees of our contractors, leading to possible injuries, death or significant damage to property and natural resources. For example, we have from time to time experienced well-control events that have resulted in various remediation and clean-up costs and certain of the other impacts described above.\n\n\nIn addition, we rely on our employees, consultants and independent contractors to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and standards. Any violation of such laws or standards by these individuals, whether through negligence, harassment, discrimination or other misconduct, could result in significant liability for us and adversely affect our business. For example, negligent operations by employees could result in serious injury, death or property damage, and sexual harassment or racial, gender or age discrimination could result in legal claims and reputational harm.\n\n\nOur Hedging Activities Limit Participation in Commodity Price Increases and Involve Other Risks\n\n\nWe enter into financial derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil, gas and NGL price volatility. To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we will be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances,\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nincluding instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts. Moreover, many of our contract counterparties have become subject to increasing governmental oversight and regulations in recent years, which could adversely affect the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements.\n \n\n\nWe Have Limited Control Over Properties and Investments Operated by Others or through Joint Ventures\n\n\nCertain of the properties and investments in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and may involve third-party working interest owners. We have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties and investments, including compliance with EHS regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures. In addition, we conduct certain of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with third parties, and the other joint venture participants may have interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us. These limitations and our dependence on such third parties could result in unexpected future costs or liabilities and unplanned changes in operations or future development, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, any bankruptcy involving, or any misconduct or other improper activities committed by, our business partners or other counterparties could negatively impact our own business or reputation.\n\n\nMidstream Capacity Constraints and Interruptions Impact Commodity Sales\n\n\nWe rely on midstream facilities and systems owned and operated by others to process our gas production and to gather and transport our oil, gas and NGL production to downstream markets. All or a portion of our production in one or more regions may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants, pipelines or gathering systems. Such access could be lost due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, weather conditions and natural disasters, terrorism or sabotage, cybersecurity incidents, accidents, field labor issues or strikes. Additionally, midstream operators have in the past been, and in the future may be, subject to constraints that limit their ability to construct, maintain or repair the facilities needed to gather, process and transport our production. Such interruptions or constraints could adversely impact our operations, including by requiring us to curtail our production or obtain alternative takeaway capacity on less favorable terms.\n\n\nCompetition for Assets, Materials, People and Capital Can Be Significant\n\n\nStrong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties. We also compete for the equipment, materials, services and personnel required to explore, develop and operate properties, such as drilling rigs, well materials and oilfield services. The rising costs and scarcity caused by this competitive pressure will generally increase during periods of higher commodity prices and can be further exacerbated by higher inflation rates and supply chain disruptions in the broader economy, including as a result of tariffs or changes in trade policy. For example, we experienced higher operating costs throughout 2023 due to steep cost inflation. Although cost inflation moderated somewhat in 2024, such inflationary pressures could continue or increase in 2025. Competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs. Certain of our competitors have resources substantially greater than ours and may have established superior strategic long-term positions and relationships. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital and downstream markets. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as changing worldwide price and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulations.\n \n\n\nLegal, Regulatory and Environmental Risks\n\n\nWe Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation, Which Can Change and Could Adversely Impact Our Business\n\n\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations, including with respect to environmental matters, worker health and safety, land and wildlife conservation, the gathering and transportation of oil, gas and NGLs, resource management and conservation policies, reporting obligations, royalty payments, unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes. Such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as surety bonds) covering drilling, completion and well operations and decommissioning obligations. If permits are delayed or not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. Moreover, certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells, removal of production facilities and other restorative actions by current and former operators, including corporate successors of former operators, which means that we are exposed to the risk that owners or operators of assets acquired from us (or our predecessors) become unable to satisfy plugging or abandonment and other restorative obligations that attach to those assets. In that event, due to\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\noperation of law, we may be required to assume such obligations, which could be material. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and remediation costs as a result of these and other laws, regulations, permits and orders to which we are subject.\n\n\nChanges in public policy have affected, and in the future could further affect, our operations. For example, various policy makers have expressed support for, and have taken steps to implement, efforts to transition the economy away from fossil fuels and to promote stricter environmental regulations, and such proposals could impose new and more onerous burdens on our industry and business. The IRA, for instance, contains hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean fuels and carbon capture and sequestration, among other provisions, potentially further accelerating the transition toward lower-or zero-carbon emissions alternatives to fossil fuels. These and other regulatory and public policy developments could, among other things, restrict production levels, delay necessary permitting, impose price controls, change environmental protection requirements, impose restrictions on pipelines or other necessary infrastructure, raise taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies and otherwise increase our operating costs. In addition, changes in public policy may indirectly impact our operations by, among other things, increasing the cost of supplies and equipment and fostering general economic uncertainty. Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity, particularly changes related to the matters discussed in more detail below.\n \n\n\nFederal Lands\n – Federal policy makers have from time to time expressed support for, and have taken steps to implement, additional regulation of oil and gas leasing, permitting and development on federal lands. For example, the Department of the Interior adopted a final rule in April 2024 revising various terms for future federal leases and wells, including by enhancing bonding requirements and increasing royalty rates, rental rates and minimum bids. Moreover, non-governmental organizations, trade groups and other private parties have filed lawsuits challenging leasing, permitting and other regulatory decisions relating to our and other industry participants’ oil and gas development on federal lands, which, if successful, could further hinder development activities or otherwise adversely impact operations. While it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impact of these actions or any other future regulatory changes, including any potential actions by the Trump Administration, any additional restrictions or burdens on our ability to operate on federal lands could adversely impact our business in the Delaware and Powder River Basins, as well as other areas where we operate under federal leases.\n\n\nHydraulic Fracturing\n – Various federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, the EPA has issued regulations under the federal Clean Air Act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, and it previously finalized regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Moreover, several state and local governments in areas in which we operate have adopted, or stated intentions to adopt, laws or regulations that mandate further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, such as requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, imposing more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations and establishing standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing. Beyond these regulatory efforts, various policy makers, regulatory agencies and political leaders at the federal, state and local levels have proposed implementing even further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including prohibiting the technology outright. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these or other proposals, any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs, delays or cessation in development or other restrictions on our operations.\n\n\nEnvironmental Laws Generally\n – In addition to regulatory efforts focused on hydraulic fracturing, we are subject to various other federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations or prior operations on assets we have acquired. Environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas. Any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. Any such changes could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.\n\n\nWater Disposal\n – Earthquakes in southeastern New Mexico, western Texas and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the oil and gas industry, particularly the disposal of wastewater in salt-water disposal wells. In addition, similar concerns have been raised about the potential connection between water disposal activities and certain surface uplift, subsidence and other ground movement in western Texas and other areas of industry activity. Increased regulation and attention given to water disposal activities could lead to greater efforts, including through litigation, to limit or prohibit oil and gas\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nactivities relying on injection wells for produced water disposal. For example, New Mexico implemented protocols requiring operators to take various actions with respect to salt-water disposal wells within a specified proximity of certain seismic activity, including a requirement to limit injection rates if the seismic event is of a certain magnitude. Separately, the Railroad Commission of Texas has shown increasing regulatory focus on seismicity and the oil and gas industry in recent years, including by suspending all disposal well permits that inject into deep strata within the Northern Culberson-Reeves area due to increasing seismicity concerns. These or similar actions directed at our operating areas could limit the takeaway capacity for produced water in the impacted area, which could increase our operating expenses, require us to curtail our development plans or otherwise adversely impact our operations.\n \n\n\nTax Matters\n – We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income, capital and other taxes in various U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions, and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of taxes we must pay. In the jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or previously operated, income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits. Changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax, the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions and the timing of such deductions, or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings could significantly increase our tax obligations, adversely impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, more generally, a change in any U.S. federal, state or local or foreign tax law, treaty, policy, statute, rule, regulation or ordinance, or in the interpretation thereof, in any jurisdiction in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate, or in which we or any of our subsidiaries are organized, could result in us incurring a materially higher tax expense, which would also adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the IRA included a 15% CAMT on certain financial statement income, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has adopted a set of model international tax rules known as the “Pillar Two” framework, a central component of which is the imposition of a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% on certain multinational enterprises. While we are still assessing the potential impacts of the CAMT and the Pillar Two rules to our business, any incremental taxes attributable to CAMT, Pillar Two or any other tax law changes, or a change in our current interpretation thereof, could be significant and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, we are regularly audited by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable and properly supported, if one or more of our tax positions are challenged by the IRS or other tax authorities (in a tax audit or otherwise), material cash payments or adjustments to tax expense may occur, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nClimate Change and Related Regulatory, Social and Market Actions May Adversely Affect Our Business\n\n\nContinuing and increasing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives, including international agreements, to reduce GHG emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Policy makers and regulators at both the U.S. federal and state levels have from time to time imposed, or stated intentions to impose, laws and regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of GHG. For example, in December 2023, the EPA finalized more stringent methane rules for new, modified and reconstructed facilities, known as OOOOb, as well as standards for existing sources for the first time ever, known as OOOOc. The final rule includes, among other things, enhanced leak detection survey requirements using optical gas imaging and other advanced monitoring, zero-emission requirements for certain devices, and reduction of emissions by 95% through capture and control systems. The final rule also establishes a “super emitter” response program that allows third parties to make reports to the EPA of large methane emissions events, triggering certain investigation and repair requirements. Fines and penalties for violations of these rules can be substantial. The rules have been subject to legal challenge, although OOOOb is already in effect. Relatedly, the IRA imposed a new charge or fee with respect to excess methane emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas facilities starting in 2024 and annually increasing through 2026, and we cannot predict whether or how the Trump Administration may seek to revise or repeal these rules or the timing of any such actions. In addition to these federal efforts, the states where we operate have already imposed, or stated intentions to impose, laws or regulations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities, including by mandating new leak detection and retrofitting requirements.\n \n\n\nPolicy makers have also advocated for expanding existing, or creating new, reporting and disclosure requirements regarding GHG emissions and other climate-related matters. For example, the EPA adopted amendments in May 2024 to its GHG Reporting Program, which, among other things, added well blowouts and other abnormal events as new categories of sources for GHG emissions reporting. In addition, the SEC finalized rules in March 2024 that require public companies to include extensive climate-related disclosures in their SEC filings, such as new disclosures on (i) material Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, including an independent assurance report, and (ii) financial statement information regarding the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions.  In April 2024, the SEC stayed the effectiveness of these rules pending the completion of a judicial review of certain legal challenges.  Similarly, California enacted legislation in October 2023 requiring extensive climate-related disclosures for companies deemed to be doing business in California, and other states are considering similar laws. The European Union has also recently adopted a set of policy initiatives, including the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which impose expansive sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements for both European Union and certain\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nnon-European Union companies. While we are still assessing the applicability of the European Union directives and California legislation and are awaiting resolution of the review of the SEC climate change rules, we would expect to incur substantial additional compliance costs to the extent these or similar disclosure requirements apply to us. We further anticipate the costs and other risks associated with any such disclosure requirements to be particularly heightened, given that reporting frameworks on GHG emissions and other climate-related metrics are still maturing and often require the use of numerous assumptions and judgments.\n \n\n\nWith respect to more comprehensive regulation, policy makers and political leaders have made, or expressed support for, a variety of proposals, such as the development of cap-and-trade or carbon tax programs. At the international level, over 190 countries have signed the Paris Agreement, which requires member nations to submit non-binding GHG emissions reduction goals every five years. Subsequent United Nations climate conferences have called for additional action to transition away from fossil fuels or otherwise reduce GHG emissions. The Trump Administration re-withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement in January 2025, and the United States’ participation in future United Nations climate-related efforts is unclear. At the state level, there have been attempts to introduce legislation whereby certain entities found responsible for contributing toward climate change over a period of time are required to pay into a fund used for climate-related projects. For example, in December 2024, New York passed its “Climate Superfund Law,” which provides for the assessment of a fee for emitters that have a sufficient nexus to the state and are found to have released more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide during 2000 through 2018. Vermont passed a similar law in May 2024, and similar legislation has been proposed in California, Massachusetts and New Jersey. We have been identified by New York as a potentially responsible party under the law; however, to date, we have not received any cost recovery demand. These and other initiatives could negatively impact our business through restrictions or cancellations of oil and natural gas activities, greater costs of compliance or consumption (thereby reducing demand for our products) or an impairment in our ability to continue our operations in an economic manner.\n\n\nIn addition to regulatory risk, other market and social initiatives relating to climate change present risks for our business. For example, in an effort to promote a lower-carbon economy, there are various public and private initiatives subsidizing or otherwise encouraging the development and adoption of alternative energy sources and technologies, including by mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. These initiatives may reduce the competitiveness of carbon-based fuels, such as oil and gas. Moreover, an increasing number of financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital have restricted or eliminated their investment in oil and natural gas activities due to their concern regarding climate change. Such restrictions in capital could decrease the value of our business and make it more difficult to fund our operations. In addition, governmental entities and other plaintiffs have brought, and may continue to bring, claims against us and other oil and gas companies for purported damages caused by the alleged effects of climate change. The increasing attention to climate change may result in further claims or investigations against us, and heightened societal or political pressures may increase the possibility that liability could be imposed on us in such matters without regard to our causation of, or contribution to, the asserted damage or violation, or to other mitigating factors.\n \n\n\nFinally, climate change may also result in various enhanced physical risks, such as an increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events or changes in meteorological and hydrological patterns, that may adversely impact our operations. Such physical risks may result in damage to our facilities or otherwise adversely impact our operations, such as if we are subject to water use curtailments in response to drought, or demand for our products, such as to the extent warmer winters reduce demand for energy for heating purposes. These and the other risks discussed above could result in additional costs, new restrictions on our operations and reputational harm to us, as well as reduce the actual and forecasted demand for our products. These effects in turn could impair or lower the value of our assets, including by resulting in uneconomic or “stranded” assets, and otherwise adversely impact our profitability, liquidity and financial condition.\n\n\nOur Environmental Performance Targets and Other ESG Initiatives May Expose Us to Risks\n\n\nWe have developed, and may continue to develop, voluntary targets related to our ESG initiatives, including our environmental performance targets and strategy. Any public statements related to these initiatives reflect our current plans and expectations and are not a guarantee the targets will be achieved or achieved on the currently anticipated timeline. Additionally, such statements are often based on assumptions or hypothetical scenarios which are necessarily uncertain. Our ability to achieve any targets is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including market factors, unanticipated changes in societal behavior, capital constraints, the pace of technological advancement and governmental policies or priorities. Moreover, as emission measurement protocols mature and related technologies continue to develop, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise the strategies outlined in our ESG initiatives. If our ESG initiatives do not meet our investors’ or other stakeholders’ evolving expectations and standards, investment in us may be viewed as less attractive and our reputation and business may be adversely impacted.\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nAdditionally, public statements with respect to environmental targets or other ESG-related goals are becoming increasingly subject to heightened scrutiny from public and governmental authorities, as well as other parties, with respect to the risk of potential “greenwashing,” i.e., misleading information or false claims overstating potential ESG benefits. Certain regulators, such as the SEC and various state agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations and other private actors have filed lawsuits under various securities and consumer protection laws alleging that certain ESG statements were misleading, false or otherwise deceptive. Conversely, “anti-ESG” sentiment has gained momentum among some governmental and private actors, and various federal and state policy makers have enacted or proposed “anti-ESG” policies, legislation and other initiatives, including efforts targeting certain practices and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion. As a result, we may also face heightened scrutiny, reputational risk, lawsuits or market access restrictions from these parties regarding our ESG initiatives.\n\n\nClaims, Litigation, Audits and Other Proceedings, Including Relating to Historic and Legacy Operations, May Adversely Impact Us\n\n\nDevon is subject to claims, litigation, audits, investigations and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments, taxing authorities and other regulatory bodies, involving a wide range of issues, such as royalty underpayment claims, tax audits, alleged environmental law violations and claims for alleged environmental damages or remediation obligations. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to numerous uncertainties, and estimating associated reserves or loss exposure involves significant judgment that may not reflect the full range of possible results. Moreover, a number of these claims and proceedings relate to historic operations or the operations of predecessor entities, which can increase the difficulty in making reserve or loss determinations due to the age of the underlying matter, limited access to relevant information or other factors. Until the final resolution of such matters, Devon may be exposed to losses in excess of any liabilities recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nPrice Controls, Export Restrictions and Other Governmental Interventions in Energy Markets May Adversely Impact our Business\n\n\nDomestic and foreign governmental bodies have from time to time intervened in energy markets by imposing price controls, restricting exports, limiting production or otherwise taking actions to impact the availability and price of oil, natural gas and NGLs. For instance, members of the European Union agreed to a price-cap framework in December 2022 for the trading of natural gas in response to rising energy costs in Europe. Similarly, during 2021 and 2022, President Biden authorized several releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to lower domestic energy prices. More recently, in May 2024, the European Union approved new regulations imposing fossil fuel import standards, which include disclosure, emission mitigation work practices and methane intensity threshold requirements, which could impact our ability to sell production in European markets. Governments may take similar actions in the future, particularly in the event of disruption in energy markets or national emergency. Any such interventions could adversely impact our business, including by depressing the price of our production and generally introducing greater uncertainty to our operations.\n\n\nGeneral and Other Risks Facing our Business\n\n\nThe Credit Risk of Our Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Us\n\n\nWe enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk. For example, we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements, our 2023 Senior Credit Facility and our insurance policies. Disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.\n\n\nIn addition, we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade, joint interest billing and other receivables. We sell our oil, gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers, and, as an operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective share of costs. We also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us or our predecessors to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets, including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells. Certain of these counterparties or their successors may experience insolvency, liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) owed to, and assumed from, us, particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment. Any such default may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and liabilities. Our business has been adversely impacted by counterparty defaults in the past, and we may experience similar defaults again in the future.\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nOur Debt May Limit Our Liquidity and Financial Flexibility, and Any Downgrade of Our Credit Rating Could Adversely Impact Us\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had total indebtedness of $8.9 billion. Our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our liquidity to debt service payments, thereby limiting our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\n\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including low commodity price environments; and\n\n\n•\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing due to higher costs and more restrictive covenants.\n\n\nIn addition, we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the U.S. with respect to our debt. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include, among others, debt levels, planned asset sales and purchases, liquidity, size and scale of our production and commodity prices. Certain of our contractual obligations require us to provide letters of credit or other assurances. Any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit, require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under the 2023 Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan, as well as the cost of any other future debt.\n \n\n\nCybersecurity Incidents May Adversely Impact Our Operations\n\n\nWe rely heavily on information systems, operational technologies and other digital technologies to conduct our business, and we anticipate expanding the use of and reliance on these systems and technologies, including through artificial intelligence, process automation and data analytics. Concurrent with the growing dependence on technology is a greater sensitivity to cyberattacks and other cyber-related incidents, which have increasingly targeted our industry. Perpetrators of cyberattacks often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating confidential, proprietary or personal information, intellectual property or financial assets, corrupting data or causing operational disruptions, as well as preventing users from accessing systems or information for the purpose of demanding payment in order for users to regain access. A wide variety of individuals or groups may perpetuate cyberattacks, ranging from highly sophisticated criminal organizations and state-sponsored actors to disgruntled employees, and the nature of, and methods used in, cyberattacks are similarly diverse and constantly evolving, with examples including phishing attempts, distributed denial of service attacks or ransomware. In addition, our vendors (including third-party cloud and IT service providers), midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyberattacks or other cyber-related incidents, which, in turn, could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information. Moreover, we and other upstream companies rely on extensive oil and gas infrastructure and distribution systems to deliver our production to market, which, in turn, depend upon digital technologies; we also rely on other critical infrastructure to operate our business, such as communication networks and power grids. Any cyberattack directed at such infrastructure or systems could adversely impact our business and operations, including by limiting our ability to transport and market our production. Furthermore, human error by our employees, contractors or third-party business partners may also cause or exacerbate a cybersecurity incident, and geopolitical instability may heighten the risk of cyberattacks against us or the infrastructure we rely upon.\n \n\n\nAs of the date of this report, though the Company and certain of our service providers have experienced certain cybersecurity incidents, we are not aware of any previous cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company. However, there is no assurance that such a breach has not already occurred and we are unaware of it, or that we will not suffer such a loss in the future. We devote significant resources to prevent cybersecurity incidents and protect our data, but our systems and procedures for identifying and protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient due to system vulnerabilities, human error or malfeasance or other factors. Any such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business, operations or reputation and lead to remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. Moreover, as the sophistication and volume of cyberattacks continue to increase, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities, and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm.\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nInsurance Does Not Cover All Risks\n\n\nAs discussed above, our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, gas and NGLs. To mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards, we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance, as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages, loss of well control, business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental. We also maintain workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance. However, our insurance coverage does not provide 100% reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. Additionally, we have limited or no insurance coverage for a variety of other risks, including pollution events that are considered gradual, war and political risks and fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have an adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.\n \n\n\nOur Business Could Be Adversely Impacted by Shareholder Activism, Proxy Contests or Similar Actions\n\n\nIn recent years, proxy contests and other forms of shareholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies. Investors may from time to time seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the Company, whether by stockholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. These actions may be prompted or exacerbated by unfavorable recommendations or ratings from proxy advisory firms or other third parties, including with respect to our performance (or the perception of our performance) under ESG metrics. Such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting our Board of Directors and employees from our long-term strategy, requiring us to incur increased advisory fees and related costs, interfering with our ability to successfully execute on core business operations and strategic transactions or plans and provoking perceived uncertainty about the future direction of our business. Such perceived uncertainty may, in turn, make it more difficult to retain employees and could result in significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock.\n\n\nOur Acquisition and Divestiture Activities Involve Substantial Risks\n\n\nOur business depends, in part, on making acquisitions, including by merger and other similar transactions, that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses. We cannot ensure that any acquisitions we attempt will be completed on the terms announced, or at all. If we are unable to make attractive acquisitions, our future growth could be limited. Furthermore, even if we do make acquisitions, such as the recently completed Grayson Mill acquisition, they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n•\nmistaken estimates or assumptions about reserves, potential drilling locations, revenues and costs, including synergies and the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\n\n•\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired assets or business; and\n\n\n•\nunknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections prove inadequate, including environmental liabilities and title defects.\n\n\nIn addition, from time to time, we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties or businesses as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity. These transactions also have inherent risks, including possible delays or failures in closing, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business and potential post-closing liabilities and claims for indemnification, as well as secondary liability for any obligations to third parties guaranteed by us. Moreover, volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders, unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing.\n\n\nOur Ability to Declare and Pay Dividends and Repurchase Shares Is Subject to Certain Considerations\n\n\nDividends, whether fixed or variable, and share repurchases are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including the Company’s financial results, cash requirements and future prospects, as well as such other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or execute share repurchases at the current rate or at all. Any elimination of, or downward revision in, our dividend payout or share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nItem 1B.\n \nUnresolv\ned Staff Comments\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\nItem 1\nC.\n \nCybersecurity\nWe maintain a corporate information security policy and program \n(the “Program”) designed to identify, assess and appropriately manage risk from cybersecurity\n threats to help maintain operational continuity and protect Devon’s networks, systems and other assets, as well as the significant amount of information we use to run our business. We employ a variety of tools designed to identify, assess and manage cybersecurity threats, including monitoring and detection programs, network security measures, firewall monitoring devices and encryption of critical data. The Program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan that provides the framework for categorizing and responding to cybersecurity incidents. \nAs part of the Program, we perform cybersecurity risk assessments of certain third-party vendors of the Company, including technology vendors and key operational suppliers and service providers.\n These assessments are intended to identify potential risks to Devon associated with our use of third-party vendors and, where appropriate, to recommend and implement mitigating controls or solutions. In addition, Devon maintains disaster recovery plans related to cybersecurity incidents as part of our broader corporate emergency preparedness program, and our employees and contractors receive cybersecurity awareness training as part of both onboarding and through periodic training opportunities, including phishing simulations.\nWe have made efforts to align the Program with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework for risk management, and we conduct an annual assessment to identify areas for potential improvement and benchmark maturity relative to peers and other companies, as well as industry and other relevant standards. Moreover, we perform regular internal testing of our systems and programs, including disaster recovery exercises and tabletop exercises. We supplement these internal efforts by periodically \nengaging\n third-party organizations to separately review and stress-test the Program.\nThe Program is administered by our Digital Security team, which is led by our Manager of Digital Security. The Digital Security team meets at least weekly to discuss any cybersecurity incidents and related response actions, emerging cybersecurity threats facing the Company and preventative measures.\n \nIt is important to Devon that members of our Digital Security team have the necessary expertise to oversee the Program and its related technologies, platforms and applications, whether through educational background, experience, technical certifications or other training.\n The Manager of Digital Security has approximately 15 years of cybersecurity experience, a degree in management information systems and multiple certifications relating to security, risk and information systems, including a security leadership certification\n. \nCybersecurity risk is an area of focus for our Board of Directors, and we include cybersecurity and related risks in our enterprise-wide risk-management framework that annually assesses risks to the Company. This year-round assessment of risk is guided by our Internal Audit team and involves our Board of Directors, management and certain internal subject matter experts. \nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight of Devon’s risks from cybersecurity threats and reviews the steps management has taken to monitor and address such risks. Our management team provides quarterly updates to the Audit Committee on activities and other developments impacting Devon’s cybersecurity.\n These updates cover a variety of topics, including, among other things, (i) regular reviews of certain cybersecurity metrics for the Company, (ii) status reviews of our cybersecurity initiatives and the results of benchmarking or other assessments of the Program and (iii) briefings on current events or trends relating to cybersecurity. \nOur full Board of Directors also receives regular updates from our management team regarding the Program, as well as reports from the Audit Committee.\nAs of the date of this report, though the Company and certain of our service providers have experienced certain cybersecurity incidents, Devon is not aware of any previous cybersecurity threats that have \nmaterially affected\n or are reasonably likely to materially affect Devon.
